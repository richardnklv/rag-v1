    "**3 Path Planning**\n\nPath planning is the subject that deals with the\ndisplacement of the robot in a prior known environment It plays a major role in building an effective\nsophisticated mobile robot Path planning as well as\ntrajectory generation are required prior to the movement\nof the robot The robot is desired to move from a starting\nposition to a goal point in the workspace A point on the\nrobot is specified and designated to follow the required\npath There are many methods to generate paths in terms\nof smoothness and curvature as well as continuity Some\nof these methods are complicated and time consuming\nbut produce very smooth paths In this paper an effective\n\n\n151\n\n\nmethod for path and trajectory generation is adopted This method consists of straight lines joined by circular\narc segments with a specified radius and turning angle These circular segments are to avoid stoppage and\nprovide continuity for the robot This method is based on\nsome parameters that should be known to define the\npath These parameters are:\n1- The start and end coordinates of each straight line\nsection, or alternatively the length and heading of\nthe section 2- The start of each circular arc segment, its radius and\nturning angle, which corresponds to the change of\norientation |r<br>arc •|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|_arc_<br>_r_<br> <br>•|_c_<br><br>•|_c_<br><br>•|_c_<br><br>•||\n|_arc_<br>_r_<br> <br>•|_c_<br><br>•||||\n|_arc_<br>_r_<br> <br>•||θ|θ|θ|\n|_arc_<br>_r_<br> <br>•||_arc_<br>|_arc_<br>|_arc_<br>|\n\n\n\nFig 4 Example of path definition\n\nFig 4 shows a simple path that consists of two straight\nlines joined by an arc with a radius r arc and a turning\nangle, θ arc, of 90° _3 1 Velocity trajectory generation_\nIn this section, the generation of a velocity trajectory\nprofile for a given continuous geometric path is treated\nas a function of time As mentioned in the previous\nsection that the path is divided into a number of sections\nconnected together in series, each section can be set to\nhave its own target of maximum velocity, called the\nsection velocity Also each section has been divided into\nthree regions for acceleration, constant velocity and\ndeceleration with respective lengths, d A, d C and d D as\nwell as time duration t A, t C and t D plus angles and radius\nfor the circular arc sections The basis of the velocity\ntrajectory is to accelerate in each section to reach the\nspecified maximum velocity of that section if possible\nwithin the section distance If the maximum velocity\nachieved for the section the robot must be able to\ndecelerate to next maximum velocity of the next section\nto maintain the continuity of the path tracking The\nintelligent of the algorithm is that it can work in no more\nthan two operations The first operation is to accelerate\nthe robot and the second one is to decelerate it The first\noperation will check if the maximum velocity of the\nsection can be achieved, with the given acceleration,\nfrom the start velocity within the length of the section If\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe maximum velocity can be reached then the\nacceleration distance and time are computed and the\nremaining distance of the section is driven at the\nmaximum velocity If the maximum velocity is not\nreachable, the robot will then either accelerate\nthroughout the whole section if it is followed by another\none or just accelerate and decelerate if it is one section The exit velocity of a section must automatically be the\nstart velocity of the next section The second operation\ndeals with calculating the distances and times for\nacceleration and deceleration from the start, section or\nthe maximum velocity to the exit velocity of each\nsection If the section length is insufficient to decelerate\nto the exit velocity then the start velocity must be\nchanged to another new velocity that the section can be\ncompleted with the desired exit velocity It is required\nthat the maximum velocity of the first section must be as\nlow as possible for the robot to be able to decelerate\nnormally to the start velocity of the next section if it is\nlower A high maximum start velocity could only occur\nif the trajectory generation algorithm is used on-line",
    "A high maximum start velocity could only occur\nif the trajectory generation algorithm is used on-line _3 2 2 Explanation of the algorithm_\nIn the first step, each section is set to have a start velocity\nequal the previous section exit velocity for the sake of\ncontinuity and may be to avoid slippage if the robot is\nknown to operate in some slippery sections or if it is\nexecuting a tight turn If the start velocity is too high to\ndecelerate to the exit velocity then it must be set to a\nlower velocity The second step is to check if the length\nof the section large enough to allow the robot to reach for\nthe maximum velocity if so then the time and distance,\nnecessary for acceleration from the start velocity to the\nmaximum velocity of the current section, are calculated\nas well as the time to drive the remaining distance with\nthe constant maximum velocity Otherwise the resultant\nvelocity of constant acceleration is the end velocity of\nthe section First and second steps together ensure that\nthere is no demand for velocity increase greater than the\nrobot actuators can deliver with fixed acceleration In the\nthird step, the end velocity of the current section is set to\nequal to the start velocity of the next section This is to\nmaintain the smoothness and continuity of the motion\nand also that the deceleration in each section starts in\ntime to complete the section and reach the start velocity\nof the next section Forth step is dealing with calculating\nthe time and distance needed for the robot to decelerate\nfrom the highest velocity reached during the execution of\nthe section to its end velocity The highest velocity is the\nmaximum velocity if the section is long enough Otherwise it is the peak velocity if the section contains\nonly acceleration and deceleration parts",
    "Otherwise it is the peak velocity if the section contains\nonly acceleration and deceleration parts **4 Motion Control**\n\nThe task of the controller is to achieve various goals and\ndesired features for the robot motion It is also designed\nto execute the planned sequences of motions correctly in\nthe presence of any error The control strategies in this\nwork are based on controlling the traction forces causing\n\n\n\n152\n\n\nthe motion as well as maintaining the tracking of the\ndesired path without any slippage or deviation Traction\nmotion control has some desired feature such as:\n1- Maintaining the fastest possible acceleration and\ndeceleration\n2- Maintaining the desired path following accuracy\n3- Maintaining the robot stability during the manoeuvres\n4- Preventing the robot from slipping or sliding\n\nThe block diagram of the mobile robot control system is\nshown in Fig Traction\nmotion control has some desired feature such as:\n1- Maintaining the fastest possible acceleration and\ndeceleration\n2- Maintaining the desired path following accuracy\n3- Maintaining the robot stability during the manoeuvres\n4- Preventing the robot from slipping or sliding\n\nThe block diagram of the mobile robot control system is\nshown in Fig 5 The controller tasks consist of two parts The first part is the 'Low level' control strategy which\ndeals with the dynamic changes in the robot The second\none is the 'High level' control strategy which deals with\nthe changes in the environment in which the robot\noperates The combined Low and High level motion\ncontrol for the robot is depicted in Fig",
