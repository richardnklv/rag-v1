    "Since the problem of inaccuracy and slowness of\nsensors appears mostly in industrial control systems, our focus\nin this paper is on control applications The rest of this paper is organized as follows A summarized\nliterature review is presented in Section 2 Problem definition\nis presented in Section 3 where we also introduce our method\nand explain its two components in detail Simulation of the\nmethod in a control system benchmark and discussion about\nits results is in Section 4 At the end, Section 5 summarizes\nthis paper with conclusion and discussion ## **2 Related Work**\n\nA complete survey of information fusion techniques for\nreliable data fusion can be found at [2], however, sensor fusion\nproblems, applications, and future directions are completely\naddressed at [3,4,5,6,7] As it can be grasping from contents\nof mentioned papers, industrial need triggered current research\nstream on more precise, yet feasible, algorithms for sensor\nfusion Consequently, we can see many application-oriented\nuses of sensor fusion in the literature A case in point, in [8]\nthey mainly concentrate on reducing redundancy and noise\nand attempted to improve failure tolerability of information\ngenerated by sensors of gas turbine power plants More\n\n\n\npractical and industrial application of sensor fusion can be\nfound at [9, 10, 11, 12] Those precise mathematical algorithms leveraged\nprobabilistic models, evolutionary methods, and intelligent\ndecision-making means as discussed and categorized\npreviously An optimal linear fusion framework was proposed\nin [13] for addressing and solving measurement systems’\nproblems In [14], authors consider two-sensor signal\nenhancement problem in a noisy environment The proposed\nsolution is based on expectation maximization algorithm for\njointly estimating the main signal, the coupling system and the\nunknown signal and noise parameters [15] presents a\nsystematic scheme for generating optimum fusion rules,\nwhich reduces computation tremendously compare to\nordinary exhaustive search In [16], two novel neural data\nfusion algorithms based on a linearly constrained least square\n(LCLS) method are proposed Early attempts for recruiting fuzzy rules in multisensory data\nfusion can be seen at [17] Inspired by their opinions, other\nresearchers use fuzzy rules for overcoming mathematical\napproaches’ shortcomings in proposing practical solution For\ninstance, a fuzzy-based multi-sensor data fusion classifier is\ndeveloped and applied to land cover classification using ERS1/JERS-1 SAR composites in [18] In addition to using fuzzy\nrules, research such as [19, 20] have tried to introduce new\nfuzzy logic operators in order to utilize intuitive knowledge\nabout a system for sensor-fusion In a practical problem, to\ncorrect slow sensor drift faults, [21] presented a hybrid method\nusing fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm In order to exploit\nadvantages of both fuzzy-logic as an outstanding intelligent\nmethod, and Kalman filter as an efficient fusion method, [22]\nsuggests a hybrid Kalman filter-fuzzy logic adaptive multisensor data fusion architectures In most of these researches, no clear differences between\nsensors is considered, but sensors have certain known\ncharacteristics describing their behaviour Naturally, using\ninformation about these characteristics can lead to better\n\ndesign of sensor fusion algorithms The results may be more\nrobust, if instead of using algorithms depending on system’s\nmodel, we take advantages of methods considering sensor\ncharacteristics only",
