hence we do\nnot resort to methods that include Monte-Carlo simulations\n\nas in [11] or [1] Instead we use large-scale Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of potentially colliding trajectories as collision\nprobability ground truth in order to assess the accuracy of\nour results The Monte-Carlo outcome is represented by a\nhistogram of the number of collisions that occur within a time\ninterval with respect to time Therefore simulating colliding\ntrajectories naturally leads to the concept of a collision probability _rate_ which is central to this article The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n1) the incorporation of the mathematical theory of level\ncrossings of multi-dimensional stochastic processes developed in [8] for the definition and computation of\na general collision probability and derivation of upper\nbounds of the collision probability rate as well as the\ncollision probability based on the entry intensity from\n\n[8] (section IV-A)\n2) derivation of approximate closed-form formulae for the\ncollision probability rate for automotive applications\n(section IV-C and app C)\n3) a novel numerical study of the collision probability rate\nwith special emphasis on the accuracy of our approximate formulae as well as on the upper bound and its\nsaturation (section V)\n4) proposal of an adaptive method to efficiently sample the\ncollision probability rate (section V-D)\n5) application of the computation of collision probability\nto a probabilistic treatment of two extended objects with\narbitrary orientation by representative salient points of\nan object’s geometry (sections IV-B and V-E)\n6) comparison of the distribution of the collision probability rate to approximations of time-to-collision distributions for one-dimensional motions from existing\napproaches (section VI)\n\nNote that while some of the contributions are specific to a twodimensional setup and hence readily applicable to automotive problems others are generally applicable to collisions of\nhigher-dimensional objects with piecewise smooth boundaries In the following two sections we will critically review\nexisting approaches to computing a collision probability, first\non the basis of spatial overlap and second with respect to\nboundary penetration II C OLLISION PROBABILITY FROM 2D SPATIAL OVERLAP\n\n\nThis is the probability of the spatial overlap between the\nhost vehicle and the colliding vehicle that has been investigated\nin [10], [4], [5] First, an instantaneous overlap probability is\ncomputed which involves integrals of the type\n\n\n\nof only 2D position and Gaussian distribution the resulting\ntwo-dimensional integral, i",

    "Another issue is that an instantaneous collision probability\nbased on the overlap of a spatial probability distribution with\nthe area of the host vehicle is determined by those sample\ntrajectories whose current end points, i e e the position at the\ncurrent time, lie within the area of the host vehicle But this\nis independent of when the trajectory has crossed the host\nvehicle boundary hence all end points except those exactly\non the boundary (whose contribution to the two-dimensional\nintegral is zero) correspond to a collision event in the past and\ntherefore too late for collision avoidance, see also fig 1 for an\nexample where the maximum of the instantaneous collision\nprobability from spatial overlap occurs after the TTC in xdirection Also, by only considering trajectories with current\nend points within the area of the host vehicle other colliding\ntrajectories with current end points outside the host vehicle\n\n\n\nwhere the state variables differ according to the model used\n(2D or 3D, with or without orientation angle _ψ_ ) The collision\nvolume _D_ can be restricted to the vehicle boundary or can\ninclude a safe distance Note that even in the simplest case\n\n\narea that have already entered and exited the boundary are\nunaccounted for What we are actually interested in is the\nprobability of the colliding object touching and/or penetrating\nthe boundary of the host vehicle What we are actually interested in is the\nprobability of the colliding object touching and/or penetrating\nthe boundary of the host vehicle This requires a different\napproach than integration over state space as in eq (2) since\nthe integral over a lower-dimensional subspace would always\nbe zero Some existing approaches that consider a boundary\ninstead of a state space volume for the computation of a\ncollision probability are reviewed in the next section III C OLLISION PROBABILITY AT BOUNDARY\n\n\nA probabilistic approach to computing the probability of\npenetrating a boundary - instead of the probability of a spatial\noverlap - has been proposed in [6] Their method is based on\nthe probability density of the time to cross a straight, axisaligned boundary assuming a constant velocity model The\nderived collision probability refers to a time period and not\njust a time instant It is only applicable to straight paths or\ncombinations of piecewise straight paths and does not take\ninto account more complex geometries such as a rectangle It relies on a separation of longitudinal and lateral motion Another limitation is that the stochastic nature of their conflict\ndetection approach only comes from the distribution of the\ninitial condition of their state – process noise is not considered A somewhat complementary approach is taken in [13] for\naircraft conflict detection in the sense that process noise is\nincorporated whereas the uncertainty of the initial condition\nis not They propose two different algorithms, one for midrange and one for short-range conflict detection For mid-range\nconflict detection their measure of criticality is an instantaneous probability of conflict and similar to the 2D spacial\noverlap discussed in the previous section It is computed\nby a specific Monte-Carlo scheme On the other hand their\nshort-range conflict detection is based on the penetration of a\nspherical boundary around the aircraft as criticality measure The dynamics is a constant velocity model perturbed by\nBrownian motion The many strong assumptions, in particular\nconstant velocity motion, specific Brownian noise model, and\ndecoupling into one-dimensional motions make this approach\nhard to generalize The approaches discussed above are limited to constant velocity models with assumptions on the coupling of longitudinal\nand lateral motion, they either incorporate specific process\nnoise or no process noise at all or exclude the uncertainty\nof the initial condition Additionally, they all rely on a timeto-go or TTC as a prerequisite quantity - either probabilistic\nor non-probabilistic As we will show in the next section, such a temporal\ncollision measure is not necessary for the computation of\na collision probability Instead, we show that a fundamental\nquantity to compute the collision probability for stochastic\nprocesses is the collision probability _rate_ The mathematical\nfoundation for this approach was provided in [8] in terms of a\nstochastic intensity for piecewise smooth boundaries Collision\nprobability rates have already been used in the context of air\ntraffic collision risk modeling: In [9] an intensity specific to\na hyperrectangular boundary has been re-derived although [8]\n\n\n\nwas known to the authors A subsequent publication ([11]) also\nincludes definitions and theorems independent of established\ndefinitions and theorems from [8] for those hyperrectangles Further applications to air traffic collision risk modeling are\npresented in [10] and [12] In the following section we define a\ncollision probability and derive upper bounds of the collision\nprobability and collision probability rate based on standard\nconcepts from the theory of level crossings and the intensity\nfor more general boundaries from [8]",
