    "## **Vertical Bifacial Solar Farms: Physics, Design, and Global Optimization**\n\nM Ryyan Khan [b,1], Amir Hanna [a,1], Xingshu Sun [b,1], Muhammad A Alam [b,1,] _[‚àó]_\n\n\n_a_ _Electrical Engineering Department, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia_\n_b_ _School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47906, United States_\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThere have been sustained interest in bifacial solar cell technology since 1980s, with prospects of 30-50% increase in the\noutput power from a stand-alone single panel Moreover, a vertical bifacial panel reduces dust accumulation and provides\ntwo output peaks during the day, with the second peak aligned to the peak electricity demand Recent commercialization\nand anticipated growth of bifacial panel market have encouraged a closer scrutiny of the integrated power-output and\neconomic viability of bifacial solar farms, where mutual shading will erode some of the anticipated energy gain associated\nwith an isolated, single panel Towards that goal, in this paper we focus on geography-specific optimizations of _ground-_\n_mounted vertical bifacial solar farms for the entire world _ For local irradiance, we combine the measured meteorological\ndata with the clear-sky model In addition, we consider the detailed effects of direct, diffuse, and albedo light We assume\nthe panel is configured into sub-strings with bypass-diodes Based on calculated light collection and panel output, we\nanalyze the optimum farm design for maximum yearly output at any given location in the world Our results predict\nthat, regardless of the geographical location, a vertical bifacial farm will yield 10-20% more energy than a traditional\nmonofacial farm for a practical row-spacing of 2m (1 2m high panels) With the prospect of additional 5-20% energy\ngain from reduced soiling and tilt optimization, bifacial solar farm do offer a viable technology option for large-scale\nsolar energy generation _Keywords:_ Bifacial solar cell, vertical panel, solar farm, global output **1 Introduction**\n\n\nA conventional monofacial panel collects light only from\nthe front side; the opaque back-sheet prevents collection\nof light scattered from ground (or surroundings) onto the\nback face of these panels This extra energy from albedo\ncan be partially recovered using a bifacial panel, where\nboth faces of the panel and the cells are optically transparent The concept of bifacial panels have been analyzed\nand experimentally demonstrated since 1980s [1, 2] Indeed, an isolated bifacial panel has been shown to have up\nto 50% extra output [2] compared to a monofacial panel Moreover, recent improvements in the design and fabrication of bifacial cell technology suggest several additional\nadvantages [3] For example, bifacial cells have a lower\noperating temperature (absence of infrared absorption at\nback metal) and better temperature coefficient (e",
    "For example, bifacial cells have a lower\noperating temperature (absence of infrared absorption at\nback metal) and better temperature coefficient (e g , HIT\ncells)‚Äîwhich would improve lifetime and integrated power\noutput Several studies in the literature have reported energy\noutput of isolated, _standalone_ bifacial panels both numerically [4, 5, 6, 7] and experimentally [8, 9, 10] These studies\ninclude optimization of the tilt angle and elevation from\nground for a single bifacial panel at various locations in\n\n\n_‚àó_ Corresponding author\n_Email address:_ `alam@purdue These studies\ninclude optimization of the tilt angle and elevation from\nground for a single bifacial panel at various locations in\n\n\n_‚àó_ Corresponding author\n_Email address:_ `alam@purdue edu` (Muhammad A Alam)\n1 The authors contributed equally the world The recent work by Guo _et al _ [11] provides a\nglobal analysis of vertical bifacial panel Given an albedo\nthreshold, they have shown that an isolated vertical panel\nwill always produce more power compared to an optimally\ntilted monofacial panel, irrespective of the geographic location The energy gain of an isolated panel defines the upper\nlimit of the performance potential of a solar cell technology Eventually, the panels will have to be installed in a\nfarm, where one must account for the mutual shading of\nthe panels Clearly, the area-averaged power output will\nnow be reduced Under these circumstances, it is not clear\nif the advantages found for isolated panels can still sustain Recently, Appelbaum [12] has provided a partial answer by analyzing a solar farm at Tel-Aviv (latitude 32 _[‚ó¶]_ N) His work focused on vertically vs optimally tilted bifacial\npanel arrays The optimally tilted farm yields 32% more\nenergy than the vertical farm (in latitude 32 _[‚ó¶]_ N)‚Äîhowever,\nit is not clear how the outputs compare to the monofacial panel array It is also difficult to know if the conclusions apply to other regions of the world An analysis that\nbroadens the previous work to all the locations of the world\n(a global optimization) will be helpful This analysis is\nparticularly important because ITRPV roadmap projects\nthat the bifacial market share will increase from 5% in 2016\nto 30% in 2026 [13] Many PV manufacturers (e g , Panasonic, Prism Solar, LG, SolarWorld, Centrotherm, etc )\n\n\n\n_Preprint submitted to Elsevier_ _November 30, 2017_\n\n\nare now producing bifacial panels A few recent solar farms\n(e g , Asahikawa Hokuto Solar Power Plant in Japan, and\nLa Silla PV plant in Chile) are utilizing bifacial panels Given this rapid progress, it is important to clearly understand the complex physics, design, and optimization of\nbifacial solar farms Among various farm configurations, vertically aligned\nbifacial panels have been of particular interest because of\nreduced soiling (dirt or snow) which increases overall energy output In addition, the higher output in the afternoon due to the ‚Äòdouble-humped‚Äô daily output profile\n\n[11] coincide with the peak electricity demand Since optimally tilted bifacial panels will always produce slightly\nmore energy compared to the vertical farms, the analysis\nof vertically aligned panels may be viewed as a lower limit\nof energy produced by an optimized bifacial farm In this paper, we offer detailed model, physics, and a\nworldwide perspective regarding ground-mounted vertical\nbifacial solar farms We combine the global meteorological data from NASA\nwith the clear-sky model from Sandia to estimate hourly\ninsolation This new algorithm bypasses the loading of\nextremely large hourly database, and allows efficient computation towards global analysis of new technologies while\nmaintaining realistic and daily averaged meteorological information Next, we model the direct and diffused light collection\n\n[14, 15, 16], as well as the non-trivial physics of albedo\nlight collection [17, 7] while accounting for relevant shadings on the panels and the ground Our generalized formulation models the non-uniform illumination along the\npanel height Only a fraction of the light incident on the\npanels will produce electricity [18] because of the spatially\nnon-uniform illumination and the nature of the electrical\n\nconnection for the panels The second aspect is often not\naccounted for in literature",
    "The second aspect is often not\naccounted for in literature We use the spatially nonuniform light collection data along with the appropriate\ncircuit model of the panels to accurately find the hourly\n_energy-output_ from the panels and the farm Mutual shading between adjacent panels penalizes\nenergy-output, thereby restricting panels from being\nclosely packed in the farm We explain how this results in\nan optimum period between the panels At high latitudes,\nthe sun-path is more tilted, resulting in larger optimum\npanel-period In addition, at the same latitude, locations\nwith more diffuse insolation tend to have a larger panelperiod Finally, we present a global perspective on the annual\nyield of vertical bifacial solar farms The key conclusion of\nthe paper is this: With inter-row separation of 2m (typically required for maintenance) for 1 2m wide panels, a\nground-mounted vertical bifacial farm outperforms a traditional monofacial farm by 10-20%, regardless of the geographical location The gain may persist even for smaller\ninter-row separation, once the energy loss due to soiling\n\n[19, 20, 21, 22] is accounted for The performance gain\nrequires a denser packing of vertical bifacial panels, the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ñé\n\n\n\n\n\nùëù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n\nFigure 1: (a) The zenith and azimuth angles ( _Œ∏_ _Z_, _Œ≥_ _S_ ) of the sun\nis shown at a specific time An example of the sun-path is shown\nby the red line (b) The vertical bifacial solar farm is depicted with\nrelevant definitions (c) This shows the angle of incidence (AOI) on\nthe panel at the specific solar position implication of which must be accounted for in the levelized\ncost of electricity (LCOE) calculation [23, 24] In sections 2 1 and 2 2, we present the details of the irradiance model, and the physical model to calculate the\nlight collection and power generation of the panels and\nthe farm In sections 3 1-3 3, we discuss the physics and\ndesign-optimization of the farm Finally, in section 3 4,\nwe present the global perspective and prospects of the optimally designed vertical bifacial solar farm Our conclusions are summarized in section 4 **2 Method**\n\n\n_2 1 Irradiance model_\n\n\n**2 1 1 Simulation of hourly GHI ** Temporal solar irradiance data consist of the position of the sun and its\nintensity This information is crucial to simulate and optimize the energy yield of solar farms To simulate such data, we first start by calculating\nthe position of the sun (solar Zenith _Œ∏_ _Z_ and Azimuth\n_Œ≥_ _S_ angles) at arbitrary time and geographic locations\nby using the NREL‚Äôs solar position algorithm [25] implemented in Sandia model library [26] Here, _Œ∏_ _Z_ is\nthe refraction-corrected Zenith angle, which depends on\naltitude and ambient temperature Second, we input the\nsun position data into the Haurwitz clear sky model to\ngenerate the Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI or _I_ _GHI_ )\n\n[27, 28] on a minute-to-minute basis Note that the clear\nsky model often overestimates insolation, especially when\nthe atmosphere is cloudy or overcast Hence, in the\nthird and final step, we integrate the simulated GHI over\ntime, which is then scaled to match the satellite-derived\nmonthly average GHI data (for 22 years) from the NASA\nSurface meteorology and Solar Energy database [29],\nwhereby local variation of GHI caused by cloudiness and\naltitude is incorporated into the calculation Therefore,\nour modeling framework fully incorporates the impacts of\ngeographic and climatic factors into modeling the solar\nirradiance",
    "Therefore,\nour modeling framework fully incorporates the impacts of\ngeographic and climatic factors into modeling the solar\nirradiance 2\n\n\n**2 1 2 Decomposition of GHI into DHI and DNI **\nCalculating the irradiance on a tilted surface requires decomposing GHI into two components: Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI or _I_ _b_ ) and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI\nor _I_ _diff_ ) The relationship between the two components\ncan be written as\n\n\n_I_ _GHI_ = _I_ _b_ cos _Œ∏_ _Z_ + _I_ _diff_ _ _ (1)\n\n\nBased on (1), however, it is impossible to separate _I_ _b_ and\n_I_ _diff_ from _I_ _GHI_ Therefore, we estimate the diffuse fraction of _I_ _GHI_ using the Orgill and Hollands model which\nempirically calculate the diffuse fraction using the clearness index of the sky ( _k_ _T_ ) [30] The clearness index is\ndefined as the ratio between _I_ _GHI_ and extraterrestrial irradiance ( _I_ 0 ) on a horizontal surface, i e ,\n\n\n_I_ _GHI_\n_k_ _T_ = _ _ (2)\n_I_ 0 _√ó_ cos _Œ∏_ _Z_\n\n\nFor a specific time and location, _I_ _GHI_ is already known\nwhile the extraterrestrial irradiance can be evaluated analytically [31]; therefore, we can obtain the clearness index _k_ _T_ on a minute-to-minute basis using (2) Knowing\n_I_ _GHI_ and _k_ _T_, we use the Orgill and Hollands model to\ndetermine _I_ _diff_, which allows us to deduce _I_ _b_ from (1) For demonstration, an example calculation of irradiance\nat Washington DC on September 22 is shown in Fig 2",
    "2 There are several empirical models for decomposing\nGHI found in literature [32, 33, 34] Generally, good\nagreement have been found among these models [35] Also, we assume isotropic sky model [36] for diffuse\nirradiance _I_ _diff_ The Perez model [37] provide a more\nelaborate and somewhat more complex representation of\nthe diffuse light However, we expect that our numerical\nresults and key conclusion will not be overly sensitive to\nthe model chosen, and the general conclusions will hold\nirrespective of the assumed models However, we expect that our numerical\nresults and key conclusion will not be overly sensitive to\nthe model chosen, and the general conclusions will hold\nirrespective of the assumed models **2 1 3 Angle of Incidence (AOI) calculation ** To evaluate the contribution of the beam component of sunlight\n(i e , _I_ _b_ ), we need to calculate the angle of incidence (AOI)\nbetween _I_ _b_ and the front/back surface of vertical bifacial\nsolar panels It turns out that AOI of an east-west facing\nvertical bifacial solar panel can be simply expressed as\n\n\n_Œ∏_ [(] _[F]_ [ )] = _AOI_ _front_ = cos _[‚àí]_ [1] [sin _Œ∏_ _Z_ _√ó_ cos( _Œ≥_ _S_ _‚àí_ _œÄ/_ 2)] _,_ (3)\n\n_Œ∏_ [(] _[B]_ [)] = _AOI_ _back_ = cos _[‚àí]_ [1] [sin _Œ∏_ _Z_ _√ó_ cos( _Œ≥_ _S_ + _œÄ/_ 2)] _ _ (4)\n\n\nfor the front and back surfaces, respectively In the next\nsection, knowing the angular and irradiance data of sunlight, we will show how to evaluate the optical absorption\nand power generation of vertically-mounted bifacial solar\nfarms",

    "A levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) optimization will be a part of a future study, but we believe\nthe key conclusion will remain the same _3 3 3 Effect of clearness index and latitude _\n\n\nAt a given latitude on Earth, the tilt of the sun and the\nsun-path is the same for all longitudes Ideally, we can thus\nexpect the insolation to depend only on latitude However,\nvariation in meteorological conditions over longitudes at a\nset latitude causes variation in GHI, clearness index, and\nthe fractional contribution of diffuse insolation Such variation in weather affects the optimal design of the vertical\nbifacial solar farm and its yearly yield For example, in\nFig 7(a) we present the optimum _p/h_ (blue) and the corresponding yearly output (red line) of the farm as a function of annual clearness index _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ at latitude 30 _[‚ó¶]_ N‚Äîthe\nlocations corresponding to the various _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ are also marked\nin the figure Here, we optimize _p/h_ to maximize the annual yield, and calculate the corresponding farm output\nfor different longitudes, but at a fixed latitude 30 _[‚ó¶]_ N Then\n\n\n\nthe results are sorted as a function of corresponding _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ to\nobtain the plots shown in Fig 7(a) 7(a) At a set latitude, the sun-path is fixed (for all longitude), which in turn determines the panel shadow length\nand dominates the choice of optimum _p/h_ However, as\nshown in Fig 7(a), at a fixed latitude 30 _[‚ó¶]_ N, there is a\nsmall variation in optimal _p/h_ with _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ In order to understand why _p/h_ decreases with _k_ [¬Ø] _T_, we need to explain the\nrelative roles of diffuse and direct light In Fig 6(d), the\nblue and red dashed lines consider solar sources when only\nthe diffuse and direct light are present, respectively For\nthe ‚ÄòDirect-only‚Äô case (red dashed line), the diffused light\ncontribution is set to zero and only the direct light and its\ncorresponding albedo contributions are used to calculate\nthe energy output The output is maximized at ( _p/h_ ) _dir_,\nas marked by the red arrow Similarly, for the ‚ÄòDHI-only‚Äô\ncase (blue dashed line), the direct sunlight is set to zero,\nand the diffused light and its albedo contributions are accounted for The ‚ÄòDHI-only‚Äô contribution maximizes at\n( _p/h_ ) _diff_, as marked by the blue arrow In general, for\nany location, we find that ( _p/h_ ) _dir_ _<_ ( _p/h_ ) _diff_ Therefore,\nwhen _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ is low, DHI or diffuse component dominates and\nthe overall optimum _p/h_ converges to ( _p/h_ ) _diff_ For example, note that the overall peak ( _p/h_ ) _optimum_ (on the blue\nsolid line in Fig 6(d)) is close to ( _p/h_ ) _diff_ position Therefore, as shown in Fig 7(a), reducing _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ below 0 45 will\nonly keep the _p/h_ at a constant value, close to ( _p/h_ ) _diff_,\ndictated by the diffuse light component In contrast, as _k_ [¬Ø] _T_\nincreases, the direct light starts to dictate the farm output,\nand the optimum _p/h_ decreases from ( _p/h_ ) _diff_ and shifts\ntowards ( _p/h_ ) _dir_ Obviously, by definition, increasing _k_ [¬Ø] _T_\nincreasing GHI Therefore, the optimum yearly yield increases with _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ The locations with higher latitudes sees larger tilt in the\nsun-path, and lower GHI Therefore, the yearly output is\nhigh close to the equator and decreases at higher latitudes,\nas shown by red line in Fig",
    "Therefore, the yearly output is\nhigh close to the equator and decreases at higher latitudes,\nas shown by red line in Fig 7(b) From equator up to\nlatitude _‚àº_ 30 _[‚ó¶]_, the optimum _p/h_ remains close to 0 8 (blue\nline), and then it increases For higher latitudes, the tilt\nof the sun (i e , _Œ∏_ _Z_ ) is larger The longer shadows results\nin higher spacing between the panels _3 4 Global Map of Energy Yield_\n\n\nWe are now ready to summarize the global optimization\nand energy yield of vertical bifacial solar farms We assume\na constant ground reflectance of 0 5 5 As explained earlier,\nwe expect decrease in GHI and output for increasing latitudes And, there are variation in design and output along\nthe longitudes due to meteorological variations The global\nyearly yield and the corresponding optimum _p/h_ is shown\nin Fig 8 8 We observe higher output in Africa and Saudi\nArabia compared to India and China due to clearer sky\n(i e , higher _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ ) and higher GHI Also, optimum _p/h ‚àº_ 0 _ _ 8\nis close to equator, and begins to increase above 30 _[‚ó¶]_ latitude _The optimum p/h is within 0 8-1 for most of the_\n_locations in the world _\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n**N** **N**\n\n\n\n**N**\n\n\n\n\n\n**S**\n**E**\n\n\n\n**S**\n**E**\n\n\n\n(c) (d)\n\n\nFigure 8: Global optimized (a) yearly yield, and (b) optimum _p/h_\nfor the vertical bifacial farm We have chosen constant 50% albedo\nreflection The sun-path is shown for latitude 70 _[‚ó¶]_ N (July) in (c)\nwith South facing monofacial and (d) with East-West facing vertical\nbifacial panel We also compare the vertical bifacial solar farm with\nthe optimized monofacial (optimized tilt [45] and spacing)\nsolar farm Conventionally, in a monofacial solar farm, the\nrow spacing is selected such that the annual shading loss\nis less than 5% This results in a set-back-ratio of 2 closer\nto equator, and 3 for mid latitudes [45] For the monofacial farms, we take into account the direct and diffuse\ninsolation, and neglect the albedo We will compare two\ncases: when the spacing is optimized for maximum energy\nyield vs when the spacing is fixed by practical considerations Note that the comparison is somewhat biased\nbecause while the monofacial farm is tilt-optimized, the\nvertical farm ‚Äì by definition ‚Äì is not",
    "Note that the comparison is somewhat biased\nbecause while the monofacial farm is tilt-optimized, the\nvertical farm ‚Äì by definition ‚Äì is not **3 4 1 Spacing optimized solar farms ** For the first\ncomparison, we determine the optimum row spacing to\nmaximize the area-normalized annual energy yield of\nmonofacial and bifacial farms for a given location in the\nworld The ratio of the ‚Äòmaximized‚Äô annual yield of the\n\n\n\nvertical bifacial farm to the monofacial farm is plotted in\nFig 9(a) Close to equator, the monofacial panels are optimally tilted parallel to the ground, and the optimal row\nspacing is close to zero Close to equator, therefore, monofacial panels collect the GHI fully, yielding the maximum\noutput for _any_ farm configuration In these locations, in\nabsence of any soiling considerations, this energy output\nis twice as large compared to a vertical bifacial farm The\nadvantage of monofacial farms decreases at higher latitude At latitudes _>_ 60 _[‚ó¶]_, the sun-path is highly tilted For example, consider the sun-path shown in Fig 8(c,d)\nfor latitude 70 _[‚ó¶]_ N in July The sun is at North-East (or\nNorth-West) in early (or late) part of the day At these\ntimes, the South-facing monofacial panel does not receive\nany direct sunlight (Fig 8(c)), unlike East-West facing\nbifacial panel (Fig 8(d)) Moreover, closer to noon, when\nthe insolation is more significant, we would observe a long\nshadow towards the North This result in prominent shading on adjacent South-facing monofacial panels, see Fig This result in prominent shading on adjacent South-facing monofacial panels, see Fig 8(c)",
    "8(c) The shadows towards the East or West are relatively\nshorter; therefore, the East-West facing vertical bifacial\npanels incur lower shading loss The bifacial panels allows the vertical farm to collect more energy both from\nthe sky and the ground compared to the optimally (and\nhighly) tilted monofacial panel array In these locations\nat high latitudes, the bifacial farm produces significantly\nmore energy than monofacial farms In these locations\nat high latitudes, the bifacial farm produces significantly\nmore energy than monofacial farms **3 4 2 Spacing with practical considerations ** Recall\nthat the period _p_ of an array is defined by the sum of\nthe row spacing and the horizontal distance covered by a\ntilted panel Unfortunately, close to equator (within 30 _[‚ó¶]_\n\nlatitudes), yield-optimized monofacial farms have a rowspacing less than 0 _ _ 25m, which is impractically small for\ninstallation and maintenance purposes For example, the\nrow-spacing in the farm is required to be 2m or higher [46] Therefore, the ‚Äòyield-optimized‚Äô comparison of the farms\nclose to equator (as discussed in the preceding section) may\nnot be practical Therefore, next we compare the energy\nyield of the farms with fixed 2m row-spacing The ratio of the annual yield of the vertical bifacial farm\nto the monofacial farm, assuming 2m row-spacing for all,\nis shown in Fig 9(b) 9(b) The conclusion is obvious: For almost all regions of the world, ground-mounted vertical bifacial farms outperform tilt-optimized monofacial farms by\n10-20% Indeed, some regions in Africa and South America may offer 50% more energy output However, there\nare a few isolated locations in the world (e g",
    "g , parts of\nChina, Columbia, Equador, etc ‚Äìmarked in deep blue in\nFig 9(b)) where bifacial cell under-performs a monofacial\ncell by 10-20% These regions are characterized by low\nclearness index, so that the shading of the diffuse light at\nthe bottom of the panel and the current-constraint associated with the lower bypass diode strongly penalizes the\npower output of a bifacial farm (see the corresponding regions in Fig These regions are characterized by low\nclearness index, so that the shading of the diffuse light at\nthe bottom of the panel and the current-constraint associated with the lower bypass diode strongly penalizes the\npower output of a bifacial farm (see the corresponding regions in Fig 8(a)) 8(a)) In these regions, bifacial farms may\nonly be viable if the panels are optimized for tilt angle and\nenergy-penalty due to soiling are accounted for Indeed,\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n2m (1 2m wide panels) In (a), the monofacial farm has optimum\n\npanel tilt and row spacing at each location vertical farms seem even more attractive as cleaning costs\n(e g , water, labor), etc are expected to be lower and overall reduction in temperature will improve farm operating\nlifetime Therefore, a LCOE-based optimization is essential to accurately quantify the possible gain in utilizing the\nvertical bifacial farm Therefore, a LCOE-based optimization is essential to accurately quantify the possible gain in utilizing the\nvertical bifacial farm **4 Summary and Conclusions**\n\n\nIn this paper, we have utilized worldwide meteorological\ndata and a detailed physical panel-array model to estimate\nannual yield of vertical bifacial solar farms",
    "Summary and Conclusions**\n\n\nIn this paper, we have utilized worldwide meteorological\ndata and a detailed physical panel-array model to estimate\nannual yield of vertical bifacial solar farms To summarize:\n\n\n1 We have combined the daily average meteorological\nNASA data [29] with a _clear-sky model_ from Sandia\n\n[26, 27, 28] to obtain hourly insolation information This combined model greatly reduces loading of large\ndatabase and speeds up computation while maintaining average meteorological insolation information This combined model greatly reduces loading of large\ndatabase and speeds up computation while maintaining average meteorological insolation information 2 Our physics model for panel array combines the effect\nof direct, diffuse, and albedo illumination onto the\npanels The mutual shading and collection from direct and diffuse insolation has been modeled based on\nprevious literature We have discussed partial shading and illumination onto the ground between panels\n\n\n\ndue to direct and diffuse sunlight The non-trivial\ncollection of this albedo light has been explained in\ndetails The spatially non-uniform illumination along\nthe panel height can affect the final panel output‚Äîour\ngeneral formulation of the model allows us to calculate\nsuch details 3 3 Due to non-uniform illumination, and string of seriesconnected cell configured on a panel, the energy output is not proportional to the insolation collection We assume that the panel is divided into 3 sub-strings\neach connected with its own bypass-diodes The final\noutput of the panels are calculated for this specific\nconfiguration 4 4 Mutual shading between adjacent panels restricts\npanels being closely packed in the farm We explain\nhow this results in an optimum period between the\npanels At high latitudes, the sun-path is more tilted,\nresulting in larger optimum panel-period And, at the\nsame latitude, locations with more diffuse insolation\n(i e , lower _k_ [¬Ø] _T_ ) tend to have a larger panel-period 5",
    "5 We present a global perspective on the annual yield\nof vertical bifacial solar farms For a practical rowspacing of 2m, the energy yield of bifacial solar farms\ncontinues to outperform the monofacial solar cells in\nmost of the regions of the world, although the energy\ngain is somewhat smaller compared to stand-alone\npanels [11] Finally, we wish to highlight three factors that will impact the LCOE of a solar farm, but were deemed beyond\nthe scope of the paper First, the increased energy yield\nof a bifacial farm requires closely spaced panels Since the\nbifacial panels are somewhat more expensive, the LCOE\nmust be calculated carefully to reflect this additional cost Second, a recent study shows that vertical panels have\nlow dust accumulation while having energy yield similar\nto conventional tilted panels [47], because of the _soiling_\n_penalty_ associated with the monofacial cells Moreover,\ncleaning the panels is expensive Therefore, the energy\ngain of vertical farms, in practice, may be higher than\nthose summarized in Fig Therefore, the energy\ngain of vertical farms, in practice, may be higher than\nthose summarized in Fig 9 Finally, a farm designed\nwith optimally tilted and _elevated_ panel array produces\nmuch more energy than a ground-mounted vertical bifacial\nfarm [12] Overall, these energy gains must be balanced\ncarefully with the increased installation cost to ensure the\nworldwide economic viability of the bifacial solar farms Overall, these energy gains must be balanced\ncarefully with the increased installation cost to ensure the\nworldwide economic viability of the bifacial solar farms **Acknowledgement**\n\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Dr C",
