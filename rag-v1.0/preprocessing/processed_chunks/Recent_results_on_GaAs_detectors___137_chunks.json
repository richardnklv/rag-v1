2 Understanding GaAs Detectors\n\n\nTo fabricate a GaAs detector two choices have to be made, namely the substrate material and the contacts\nused Care must also be taken over surface preparation and passivation The GaAs used almost universally is semi-insulating undoped, SI-U, LEC industrial substrate material\nsupplied by various manufacturers Material with a low carbon concentration and chromium- or iron-doped\nmaterial, supplied by SITP, Tomsk, have been proposed as alternatives for improved radiation hardness Charge\ncarrier absorption lengths vary from 100µm to 1600µm for holes and 100µm to 500µm for electrons [2] The low\ncarbon material has the largest values for electrons The spread in these values, even from a single manufacturer,\nis also considerable For a 200µm thick detector it is desirable to have absorption lengths for both carriers in\nexcess of 200µm The detector may be fabricated with either a p-i-n structure [3] by doping the substrate\nmaterial, or with a Schottky and an ohmic contact realized by metal deposition The leakage current of a typical LEC diode as a function of reverse bias is shown in figure 1 The value of\nthe plateau current, which is independent of diode thickness, is between 10 and 30nA mm [−][2] at 20 [o] C When a\nvoltage corresponding to approximately one volt per micron of substrate thickness, V fd, is reached the leakage\ncurrent increases dramatically due to current injection through the ohmic contact Also shown in the figure is\nthe current characteristic of a diode with an improved ohmic contact where the leakage current increases only\nslowly above the bias V fd This reduced current at high voltages allows the detector to be operated up to\nvoltages approaching twice V fd The improved ohmic contact was realised by annealing a multi-layer titaniumpalladium-germanium metal contact Alenia SpA have fabricated diodes with an ion-implanted ohmic contact\nwhich allow a bias many times V fd to be applied [4] The surface quality and thus preparation of the wafer has proved important in obtaining high charge collection efficiencies (CCE) The CCE increases linearly with applied bias (shown in figure 2 for a typical detector)\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**8 0**\n\n\n**6 0**\n\n\n**4 0**\n\n\n**2 0**\n\n\n**0**\n\n|Col1|V<br>fd|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n\n\n\n**0** **5 0** **100** **150** **200** **250** **300**\n\n## **Reverse Bias (V)**\n\n\nFigure 2: The charge collection efficiency as a function of bias for a 200µm thick SI-U LEC GaAs pad detector\n\n\nuntil the bias V fd is reached, where the efficiency for a 200µm detector is typically between 60% and 80% At\nhigher biases the efficiency slowly increases towards 100% Although high resistivity GaAs would be expected to deplete at a few volts this is not found to be the case With an alpha particle source on the back, ohmic contact, for example, signals are only observed at bias voltages\ngreater than V fd The electric field distribution in the material consists of two regions: a high field region with an approximately\nconstant value of 1 V/µm where charge collection is high and a low field region where almost no collection occurs The penetration depth of the high field region has been measured at 0 7 to 1 0 µm per volt, depending upon\nmaterial [5, 6, 7] The field distribution explains the increase in leakage current at V fd, the linear dependence\nof CCE on bias, and the observation of rear alpha signals only at biases in excess of V fd ## 3 ATLAS detectors\n\n\n3 1 Strip Detectors\n\n\nLast year GaAs microstrip detectors with parallel strip patterned Schottky contacts were tested at CERN\n\n[2, 8, 9] Different strip pitch and metal contact width-to-pitch ratios were used to investigate the effects of\ncharge sharing and possible signal loss between strips These detectors met LHC performance specifications\nwith respect to signal to noise, resolution, and speed [10] The first wedge-shaped ATLAS prototype detectors from EEV and Alenia were tested at CERN in the H8\ntest beam this year These have 65mm long Schottky fan-shaped strips with the pitch varying from 50µm at the\nnarrow end to 76µm The detectors have integrated bias structures and silicon nitride decoupling capacitors The detectors were read out by either analogue (Felix [11]) or binary [12] electronics One detector irradiated\nto a fluence of 7 7 10 [13] 24GeV/c p/cm [2] was tested at room temperature with Felix readout Two parallel strip\ndetectors with integrated resistors and decoupling capacitors fabricated upon Tomsk substrates, one of which\nirradiated to a fluence of 3 10 [13] p/cm [2], were also tested with Felix readout",
    "Two parallel strip\ndetectors with integrated resistors and decoupling capacitors fabricated upon Tomsk substrates, one of which\nirradiated to a fluence of 3 10 [13] p/cm [2], were also tested with Felix readout Analysis of these data has just\nbegun 3 2 Pixel Detectors\n\n\nThe work reported in this section has been performed by members of RD8 and RD19 Figure 3: Detection efficiency of GaAs pixel detector AL-IOC-10 with an ion-implanted ohmic contact as a\nfunction of Omega3 read-out chip comparator threshold value\n\n\nGaAs pixel detectors have been developed which are compatible with the RD19 Omega3/LHC1 [13] read-out\nelectronics The pixel detectors form an array of 16 x 128 elements each 50µm by 500µm in size The latest\npixel detectors fabricated by Alenia with an ion-implanted ohmic back contact have been tested in a 120GeV/c\npion beam The detectors were 200µm thick and biased to 500V The detection efficiency dependence upon the\nOmega3 comparator threshold for the two planes of GaAs pixels under test in an Omega2 silicon telescope is\nshown in figure 3 The pixels performed as well as the silicon telescope and demonstrated 100% CCE These\nresults are from on-line analysis but show that GaAs pixels work extremely well ## 4 Radiation Hardness\n\n\nIn the GaAs forward tracker detector of the ATLAS experiment the fluence is dominated by pions at an estimated\nlevel of 1 2 10 [14] π/cm [2] over the experiment‘s ten year lifetime [14] The neutron fluence is expected to be 3\nto 10 times less that this, while that due to the other charged hadrons is small in comparison The effects of\nparticular radiation have therefore been investigated Electrons and gamma rays have shown negligible effects The increase in leakage current due to neutrons (n), protons (p), and pions (π) is small, typically at the 50%\nlevel after 10 [14] particles/cm [2], and the current exhibits a slow decrease with time at room temperature after\nirradiation The value of V fd is typically half its pre-irradiation value after 3 10 [13] p/cm [2] and remains unchanged\nat higher fluences The charge collection, however, falls with fluence, with the hole signal component being more affected The\nreduction of CCE with fluence depends on the type and energy of the irradiating particle For a 200µm thick\nLEC detector the CCE falls to 20% after 4 10 [14] n/cm [2] (5300 electrons) or 1 5 10 [14] p/cm [2] or only 6 10 [13]\n\npions/cm [2] [15] The differences have been explained in term of the different non-ionising energy loss, NIEL, of\nthe particles in the detector material, as shown in figure 4 [16] All LEC material, except for the low carbon material, appears to degrade to give a minimum ionising particle\nsignal of approximately 4500 electrons after a fluence of 1 6 10 [14] p/cm [2] The latter material may be slightly\nmore radiation hard due to the high initial values of the charge carrier mean free drift lengths and gives a signal\nof 7000 electrons after the same fluence [17] Diodes fabricated on Tomsk material have shown better radiation hardness [18], with a reduction of 50% in\nCCE after a fluence of 1 1 10 [13] (1GeV/c) p/cm [2] at a flux of 5 10 [14] p/hour A dependence of the degradation\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**8 0**\n\n\n\n\n\n**6 0**\n\n\n**4 0**\n\n\n**2 0**\n\n\n**0**\n\n|Neutrons<br>Pions<br>Protons|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||||\n\n\n\n**0** **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **1 0**\n\n\n**Total NIEL (10**14 keV per gm)**\n\n\nFigure 4: The charge collection efficiency as a function of total NIEL for ISIS neutrons, 300MeV/c pions and\n24GeV/c protons for 200µm thick SI-U LEC GaAs detectors\n\n\nof CCE on the rate of irradiation has been reported With a flux of only 5 10 [13] p/hour the 50% CCE reduction\noccurs after a fluence of 1 5 10 [14] p/cm [2] Proton irradiations have been performed between -5 [o] C and -10 [o] C\non LEC material Preliminary results suggest that the reduction in CCE is slightly worse than with room\ntemperature irradiations ## 5 X-ray Detection\n\n\nA thickness of 200µm of GaAs has more than an order of magnitude higher X-ray absorption efficiency with\nrespect to 300µm of silicon over the medically interesting energy range of 10 to 100keV The detection properties\nof GaAs and Ge are similar but GaAs detectors can be operated at or just below room temperature The\nincreased absorption efficiency implies that a lower dose is required for imaging applications to produce an\nimage of similar quality to that from film or silicon detectors A 100µm thick GaAs pad detector with an\nion-implanted ohmic contact, biased at 500V, has been used to produce Am-241 X-ray spectra [19] At 20 [o] C\nthe energy resolution of 20% allowed lines down to 20keV to be distinguished At -30 [o] C the leakage current\nreduction allowed lines as low as 8keV to be resolved, with a resolution of 4% Low pressure growth of VPE GaAs is being investigated as a possible source of affordable, high quality\nmaterial for X-ray imaging The first samples have recently been supplied for evaluation by Epitronics Corp [20] These are 80µm thick, with charge carrier concentration ∼ 2-3 10 [14] /cm [3] The material was found to\ndeplete as expected from standard theory to a depth of 20µm for an applied bias of 100V The CCE of simple\npad detectors fabricated with this material was 100% in the depleted region, allowing the Barium (32keV) K\nX-ray line to be resolved The limiting factor was again the leakage current noise which was very high due to\nthe rough surface of the VPE material Careful mechanical and chemical polishing of the wafer can reduce the\nleakage current and thus allow better resolution to be obtained GaAs pixel detectors bump-bonded to Omega3 read-out electronics have been used to image medical X-ray\nphantoms with Am-241 and Cd-109 X-ray sources [21] The results are encouraging, with high signal-to-noise\nand signal-to-contrast ratios being obtained The results were improved by the partial removal of Compton\ninteractions using the fast-OR trigger of the electronics Auto-radiography applications have been investigated\nby imaging beta particles from P-32 labelled human mammary cells A low noise level of 10 [−][4] cps mm [−][2] and\nlinearity for activities between 0 005nCi and 0 5nCi were obtained Further improvements are possible in the\nquality of both the VPE and LEC material and should allow better results to be obtained ## 6 Conclusions\n\nThe extended knowledge of the mechanism of charge transport in GaAs has led to detectors with 100% CCE ATLAS prototype strip detectors have been fabricated and test-beam results are being analysed The required\nspecifications for ATLAS pixel detectors have been met While the reduction in CCE due to charged hadron\nirradiation is severe in conventional LEC material, low carbon material or Tomsk technology may provide better\nradiation resistance The flux dependence of CCE degradation has to be investigated further X-ray detection\nwith bulk-grown and VPE GaAs is under investigation At present, leakage current noise limits the obtainable\nresolution for room temperature operation",
