    "# Dynamic balancing of super-critical rotating structures using slow-speed data via parametric excitation\n\nShachar Tresser, Amit Dolev and Izhak Bucher\n\n\nDynamics Laboratory, Technion, Israel\n\n### Abstract\n\n\nHigh-speed machinery is often designed to pass several “critical speeds”, where vibration\n\n\nlevels can be very high To reduce vibrations, rotors usually undergo a mass balancing\n\n\nprocess, where the machine is rotated at its full speed range, during which the dynamic\n\n\nresponse near critical speeds can be measured High sensitivity, which is required for a\n\n\nsuccessful balancing process, is achieved near the critical speeds, where a single deflection\n\n\nmode shape becomes dominant, and is excited by the projection of the imbalance on it The\n\n\nrequirement to rotate the machine at high speeds is an obstacle in many cases, where it is\n\n\nimpossible to perform measurements at high speeds, due to harsh conditions such as high\n\n\ntemperatures and inaccessibility (e The\n\n\nrequirement to rotate the machine at high speeds is an obstacle in many cases, where it is\n\n\nimpossible to perform measurements at high speeds, due to harsh conditions such as high\n\n\ntemperatures and inaccessibility (e g , jet engines) This paper proposes a novel balancing method of flexible rotors, which does not require the\n\n\nmachine to be rotated at high speeds With this method, the rotor is spun at low speeds, while\n\n\nsubjecting it to a set of externally controlled forces The external forces comprise a set of\n\n\ntuned, response dependent, parametric excitations, and nonlinear stiffness terms The\n\n\nparametric excitation can isolate any desired mode, while keeping the response directly\n\n\nlinked to the imbalance A software controlled nonlinear stiffness term limits the response,\n\n\nhence preventing the rotor to become unstable These forces warrant sufficient sensitivity\n\n\nrequired to detect the projection of the imbalance on any desired mode without rotating the\n\n\nmachine at high speeds Analytical, numerical and experimental results are shown to validate\n\n\nand demonstrate the method ### Nomenclature\n\nAmplitude of the response of the _j_ _[th]_ mode\n\n_[a]_ _j_\n\n\n_A_ Response of the _j_ _[th]_ mode\n_j_\n\n\n**C** Damping and gyroscopic matrix\n\n\n**D** Damping matrix\n\n\n_D_ _i_ Differentiation operator w/r to time scales i\n\n\n**f** Imbalance force vector\n_ib_\n\n\nModal imbalance force vector\n\n**[f]** _m_\n\n\n**f** _co_ Correction masses force vector\n\n\n Modal trial mass\n\n_[f]_ _m_\n\n\n **f** _ib_ Trial mass vector\n\n\nModal imbalance force vector at trial run\n\n**[f]** _m_\n\n\n**f** Nonlinear force vector\n_nl_\n\n\n**G** Gyroscopic matrix\n\n\n_i_  1\n\n\n**I** Identity matrix\n\n\n_k_ Parametric excitation’s stiffness (pumping amplitude)\n_p_\n\n\n_k_ Minimal required pumping amplitude\n_pa_,min\n\n\n**K** _t_ Time dependant stiffness matrix\n##### p \n\n\n**K** Stiffness matrix\n\n\nCubic stiffness constant\n\n_[k]_ 3\n\n\n**M** Mass matrix\n\n**q** Vector of degrees of freedom\n\n\n_S_ -

    "Frequently, reaching high rotation speeds involves conditions that do not\n\n\nenable measurements of the imbalanced response (e g g , jet engines where operating\n\n\nconditions involve very high temperatures and hazardous environmental conditions\n\n\nsurrounding the rotor) The technical challenges often lead to one of the following:\n\n\na A conservative over-design, trying to keep the critical speeds well above the\n\n\noperating speed b A compromise on the balancing procedure, by using commercial balancing machines\n\n\n[6][12][13], which are incapable of rotating at sufficiently high speeds (e A compromise on the balancing procedure, by using commercial balancing machines\n\n\n[6][12][13], which are incapable of rotating at sufficiently high speeds (e g g , small Jet\n\n\nengines rotate at 100,000 rev/min, while balancing machines are normally limited to\n\n\n3000 rev/min , small Jet\n\n\nengines rotate at 100,000 rev/min, while balancing machines are normally limited to\n\n\n3000 rev/min ) A commercial balancing machine calculates two correction masses\n\n\nthat cancel the reaction forces while spinning the rotor at a low speed, assuming that\n\n\nthe rotor is rigid [3–6] Although rigid rotor balancing is a very simple and\n\n\nstraightforward procedure, it cannot identify the projection of the imbalance on high\n\n\nspeed flexible modes In fact, in some cases rigid rotor balancing can even increase\n\n\nthe projection of the imbalance on high speed related flexible modes [5,11] In fact, in some cases rigid rotor balancing can even increase\n\n\nthe projection of the imbalance on high speed related flexible modes [5,11] c Damping elements (e g g , squeeze film, magnetic [14,15]) are proposed as a common\n\n\ndesign alternative for poorly balanced rotors, these add weight and often\n\n\nunacceptable complexity Given these limitations, a different approach is required, which substantially amplifies the\n\n\nprojection of the imbalance on high frequency modes (modes related to high rotation speeds),\n\n\nwhile rotating at low speeds To achieve this goal, dual frequency parametric excitation\n\n\ntechniques are adopted here Parametric amplifiers are known for their high amplification and selectivity and indeed these\n\n\nfind use in various fields of physics and engineering In recent years, parametric resonators\n\n\n(PR) have found use in various engineering areas [16–19], mainly due to Micro- and Nano\n\n\nElectro Mechanical Systems technologies, which allow low fabrication costs, good\n\n\nperformances [20], and easy integration into engineering systems [18,21] Usually, the\n\n\nprincipal parametric resonance is employed where the first linear instability tongue in the\n\n\nInce-Strutt diagram [22–26] resides Parametric excitation can amplify some forces through\n\n\na combination of their frequencies in a manner the structural dynamics favours [27–29] Recently, Dolev and Bucher introduced a tuneable parametric amplifier (PA) with a\n\n\nhardening, Duffing-type nonlinearity [30,31] The PA differs from what has been presented\n\n\nso far because it frees the amplified signal frequencies from being an integer multiple of the\n\n\nnatural frequency [32], as commonly assumed under parametric resonance The proposed\n\n\napproach does not pose an impractical constraint as done in some cases, yet it obtains a better\n\n\nperformance than an alternative mixing approach [33] which relaxes this condition, but does\n\n\nnot produce sufficient amplification without very high pumping levels [33,34] (high\n\n\nexcitation forces) It was shown that the PA significantly amplified a selected mode of\n\n\nvibration, even when the external force frequency was much lower than the system's natural\n\n\nfrequency The present paper embraces the basics of the method in [31] by employing a dual frequency\n\n\nparametric excitation as a mean to detect the projection of the imbalance on any desired\n\n\nmode, while rotating much slower than the critical speeds The paper outlines the proposed method with a brief introduction of the relevant dynamics\n\n\nand the governing equations Later, both numerical simulations and experimental results are\n\n\nshown to validate the analytical model, and the novel balancing method ### 2 Proposed Method\n\n\nIn order to describe the proposed approach, it is necessary to define basic terms from the\n\n\ndynamics of rotating structures Indeed, the response to imbalance of a linear structure is the\n\n\nbasic layer on which the method is built The equations of motion for a constant speed of\n\n\nrotation, can be written in complex vector format as:\n\n\n**Mq**  **Cq**  **Kq**  2 **f**

force vector, representing its spatial distribution ] _ib_\n\n\nalong the structure, **q** is the degrees of freedom vector, and  the rotation speed For\n\n\nsimplicity, in this work, both the experimental system and the analysis ignore the gyroscopic\n\n\neffect and the change of mode shapes with speed of rotation The force exerted by imbalance depends on the speed of rotation,  The response to\n\n\nimbalance, when the gyroscopic effect is negligible, is composed of a superposition of all\n\n\nmode shapes, where each mode is excited by the projection of the imbalance on it, as shown\n\n\nbelow [1]:\n\n\n\n_T_ **f**\n####  n ib \n\n\n\n _T_ 2 i  _t_\n\n\n\n_T_ **f**  2 _e_ i  _t_\n_n_ _n_ _ib_\n\n\n\n, (2)\n\n\n\n _n_ _n_\n\n\n## q (, ) z t     n  n f\n\n\n\n2

subscript – _pj_ _p_ stands for the pumping frequency (there are two\n\n\nhere,  _a_ and  _b_ ), and _j_ is the indication of quantities linked to the _j_ [th] natural frequency\n\n\nrelated to the appropriate mode In order to excite the _n_ [th] natural frequency, the parametric frequencies are set to:\n\n\n _a_  2  _n_  _a_,  _b_   _n_   _b_, (16)\n\n\nwhere [] _i_ [ is a detuning parameter The first frequency (]  _a_ ) produces principal parametric\n\n\nresonance, whose role is to significantly amplify the response near the desired natural\n\n\nfrequency The latter (  _b_ ) is referred to as the \"blending element\", whose role is to couple\n\n\nthe response to the imbalance, such that their sum of frequencies corresponds to the natural\n\n\nfrequency of the mode to be balanced Since we wish to maximize the effect of the blending element, we require that no other secular\n\n\nterms will arise due to the non-linearity (so that there will be no subharmonic or\n\n\nsuperharmonic resonances) By expanding Eq (14) the requirement above means that none\n\n\nof these combination should exist:\n\n####  j   3  k, 2  k  j, 2  k , 2  k, 3  , j k,  1,2 (17)\n\n\nThe nonlinearity is required in order to limit the response, and achieve a steady state solution\n\n\n[35] As shown in Eq (12), the response to imbalance is a superposition of the projection of\n\n\nthe imbalance on all modes, hence secular terms arise due to the projection of the imbalance\n\n\non all modes, as can be seen in Eq (15) Since only the projection on the _n_ [th] mode is of interest,\n\n\nit proves to be useful to set the parametric excitation so it produces secular terms only at the\n\n\n_n_ [th] natural frequency This is achieved by setting the modal

of  _j_ 0 from the 2 [nd] equation of Eq (27) in closed form is not possible, and results\n\n\nin a transcendental equation, hence the phase can be computed by iterative search An\n\n\nalternative approach has been proposed in [30] where the phase can be computed from the\n\n\nroots of a polynomial equation without iterations Frequency response curves and a comparison of the analytical model to numerical\n\n\nsimulations are shown in Fig 2, for both modes The analytical solutions are in excellent\n\n\nagreement with the numerically computed ones Figure 2 shows that upon tuning the\n\n\nfrequency of the parametric excitation, one can obtain large amplification of the vibratory\n\n\nresponse at either mode1 or mode 2 It is shown in Fig 2 that the response has multiple\n\n\nsolutions, with 2 stable possible solutions (calculation of stability is done by applying a\n\n\nstandard local stability check [35] as shown in appendix B) As will be explained later on in\n\n\nthis section, the zone where a single solution exists is of greater interest The response in case\n\n\nof a detuning leading to two stable solutions is addressed in section 3 2 1 We point out three important conclusions from Eq (28):\n\n\na The response level depends only on the projection of the imbalance on the desired\n\n\nmode b The magnitude of the response strongly depends on the phases of the modal\n\n\nimbalance  _j_ and the blending excitation’s phase  _b_ Moreover, there is a simple\n\n\nrelationship between these phases and a combination which gives rise to

(28)), sweeping\n\n\nthrough the former is the key to the proposed balancing procedure, as will be explained\n\n\nthoroughly in section 2 2 An effective balancing procedure requires two conditions:\n\n\na Sufficiently large signals (high amplification) such that the measured amplitudes are\n\n\nwell above the noise level b Sensitivity to the imbalance and to the phase of the parametric excitation is sufficient\n\n\nto reduce the effect of noise and other dynamical effects to an acceptable level The sensitivities are defined as:\n\n\n\n _a_  _a_\n\n_S_    _j_, _S_ 

that lead to a single\n\n\nvalued solution (see also Figure 2) _Figure 3: Sensitivities of the system vs the detuning, as computed for mode #1 (a) Sensitivity to the magnitude of the_\n\n\n_modal

    "##### 2 2 Balancing procedure\n\n\nThe practical meaning of the three stated conclusions derived from Eq (28), is that by setting\n\n\nthe parametric excitation to be sufficiently large, according to Eq (30), one can modify the\n\n\nvalue of the parametric excitation's phase,  _b_, until minimal amplitude is reached, denoted\n\n######  b 0 from now on This allows one to find the location of the modal imbalance  j according\n\n\nto Eq (29) The phase of the modal imbalance  _j_ has two possible solutions spaced 180\n\n\ndegrees apart The true location and magnitude of the imbalance can be found by placing a\n\n\ntrial mass, resulting in a modal trial mass of  _[f]_ _m_ (the projection of the trial mass on the\n\n\nmode) An alternative is to place a modal trial mass set [3], denoted by  **f**, namely placing _ib_\n\n\nseveral trial masses corresponding to an individual mode Instead of placing trial masses, one\n\n\ncan apply equivalent synchronous forces by the voice coils, without the need for applying real\n\n\ntrial masses, which may in some cases require disassembly and re-assembly of machine parts The total modal imbalance at the trial run is:\n\n\n_f_ _m_ _e_  _i_  _j_  _f_ _m_ _e_  _i_  _j_  _f e_ _m_  _i_ (  _j_  ) (32)\n\n\nThe sweeping process of  _b_ is performed again, so that the phase  _j_ is found (again, two\n\n\npossible solutions 180 degrees apart) The modal trial mass should be placed about 90\n\n\ndegrees apart from  _j_ to achieve maximum change in  _j_ Since the imbalance at the trial run\n\n\nmust lie between  _j_ and , the true location of  _j_ (and  _j_ ) can be found The magnitude of\n\n\nthe modal imbalance can be computed by the following expression:\n\n\n####     j    j \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n_f_\n\n\n\n\n_f_\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_f_ _m_ sin   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n, (33)\n\n\n\n_m_ _j_\n\n\n\n\n_m_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_j_\n\n\n\nas shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 _Figure 4: possible solutions for_  _j_ _in the first run (blue line), and the trial run (red dashed line) with a trial mass_\n\n\n_(black dot) _\n\n\n_Figure 5: extraction of imbalance First run (full line), trial run (dashed line) and trial mass (dotted line) _\n\n##### 2",
    "_\n\n##### 2 3 Sensitivity to various parameters\n\n\nThe balancing procedure is based on two principles: amplification of the response, and\nsensitivity to the phase of the excitation, denoted by _S_  _b_ A successful balancing procedure,\n\n\nrequires proper selection of the various parameters, such as the excitations’ levels _k_ _pa_, _k_ _pb_,\n\n\nthe nonlinearity _[k]_ [, and the amount of detuning] 3 [] [ As seen from Eq (28), the amplification ]\n\n\ngrows with an increase in the excitations’ levels _k_ _pa_, _k_ _pb_ The magnitude of the blending\n\n\nelement is _k_ _pb_, hence the sensitivity to the imbalance increases with it, as shown in\n\n\nFigure 6 However _k_ _pa_, governs the principal parametric resonance, so it can greatly increase\n\n\nthe amplitude, but causes the response to be less sensitive to the imbalance, even if _k_ _pb_ is\n\n\nincreased as well (i e , the sensitivity becomes narrow banded, as shown in Figure 7) ###### _Figure 6: The effect of k pb on the amplitude (a) and sensitivity (b), stable solutions (continuous lines), and unstable_\n\n\n_solutions (dashed lines) _\n\n###### Figure 7: The effect of k pa (  k pa / k pa,min ) on the amplitude (a) and sensitivity (b), for k pb  2 k pa, stable\n\n\n_solutions (continuous lines), and unstable solutions (dashed lines) _\n\n\nThe ideal detuning level, denoted by  _opt_, is the one for which the sensitivity to phase of the\n\n\nexcitation is highest This value can be found experimentally, since it is located at the point in\n\n\nwhich the frequency response curve starts bending upwards sharply, as can be seen in Figure\n\n\n7 to Figure 10 As mentioned earlier, the nonlinearity _[k]_ [ determines the maximal response amplitude at ] 3\n\n\nsteady state The nonlinearity should be set to achieve the desired steady state amplitude Note that at  _opt_, where the sensitivity is the greatest, the nonlinearity has little effect on the\n\n\namplitude, but has a significant effect on the sensitivity, as shown in Figure 8 _Figure 8: The effect of_ _[k]_ _[ on the amplitude (top) and sensitivity (bottom) ]_ 3  _opt_ _shown by vertical dashed lines Stable_\n\n\n_solutions (continuous lines), and unstable solutions (dashed lines) _\n\n\nThe response (amplification) and the sensitivity _S_  _b_ are also very sensitive to parameters\n\n\nwhich cannot be controlled, such as the amount of imbalance and damping, as shown in\n\n\nFigure 9 and Figure 10 _Figure 9:The effect of_  _on the amplitude (a) and sensitivity (b), for constant levels of excitation and nonlinearity _\n\n\n_Stable solutions (continuous lines), and unstable solutions (dashed lines) _\n\n\n_Figure 10: The effect of modal imbalance_ _[f]_ _[ (in gr mm) on the amplitude (a) and sensitivity (b) Stable solutions ]_ _m_\n\n\n_(continuous lines), and unstable solutions (dashed lines) _\n\n\nThe smaller the damping or the imbalance are, the more the frequency response curve\n\n\nbecomes narrow banded, bringing the two stable solutions closer to each other, and the\n\n\nsensitivity also becomes more narrow-banded This means that at low levels of damping\n\n\nand/or imbalance, finding  _opt_ experimentally may become harder, requiring high resolution\n\n\nin the frequency of the excitations ### 3 Numerical and Experimental Validations\n\n\nA test rig for the system described in Figure 1 was built, where the controlled forces were\n\n\napplied by linear voice coil actuators The motion of the plate was measured by laser\n\n\ndisplacement sensors, and the shaft's speed was controlled by a DC motor, and measured by\n\n\na magnetic encoder at the shaft's end The test rig is shown in Figure 11 _Figure 11: Test rig_\n\n##### 3 1 Calibration process\n\n\nFirst, the test rig parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios) were\n\n\nestimated by means of standard modal testing [36], and the amount of imbalance was\n\n\nestimated by means of standard \"Influence

proposed method was carried out, without rotating the rotor, but having the voice\n\n\ncoils apply known forces that simulate imbalance forces, at a phase angle of 0 [o] The\n\n\nexperiments were conducted at a frequency of 8 Hz (the 1 [st] critical speed was 18 9 [Hz]), with\n\n\na detuning level of  / 1 1%, for which high sensitivity is achieved (see Figure 2, Figure\n\n\n3 and Figure 15) The results are compared to analytical and numerical calculations, and are\n\n\nshown in Figure 12 _Figure 12: Calibration process for the 1_ _[st]_ _mode – sweeping_  _b_ _ Modal amplitude (a), and phase (b) Analytical_\n\n\n_solution (lines), numerical simulations (dots) and experimental results (squares) _\n\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 12, the experiments resulted in a periodic response as expected, with\n\n###### a slight shift in the phase with respect to the calculations The phase of the response,  10, slightly changes with  b, up to a sharp change of 180 [o], after reaching  b 0 At  b 0, the phase  10 is 90 [o] away from its value when the amplitude is at its maximum Since near  b 0 the phase  10 changes rapidly it is hard to find its exact value experimentally Therefore, the value of  10 at  b 0 is calculated by the average of the values where the response is maximal, as shown in Table 2 The phase  1 is calculated by Eq (29), as shown in Table 2 _Table 2:

procedure may lead to a slight error even when the analytical model is used, as\n\n###### shown in Table 2 This is because the evaluation of  10 at  b 0 is not exact The calibration process shows that the experimental results of the 1 [st] mode need to be\n\n\ncorrected by 14 [o] It is important to note that the numeric simulations are in good agreement\n\n\nwith the analytic model (e g",
    "g , see Figure 12), which implies that the angle shift is not due to\n\n\nthe approximations of the analytic model The reason for this shift is still unclear, perhaps it\n\n\nis due to the slight error in the estimation of the natural frequency, nonlinearity and/or\n\n\ndamping - see Figure 15, or since the dynamics of the electrical system is not modelled The reason for this shift is still unclear, perhaps it\n\n\nis due to the slight error in the estimation of the natural frequency, nonlinearity and/or\n\n\ndamping - see Figure 15, or since the dynamics of the electrical system is not modelled ##### 3 ##### 3 2 Balancing the 1 [st] mode\n\n\nAll the experiments were conducted at spin speed of 8 Hz, where the 1 [st] critical speed was\n\n\n18 9 Hz The experiments were conducted at the same detuning level used for the calibration\n\n\nprocess The initial experiments were conducted with added imbalance, so that  _opt_ would\n\n\nbe easier to find (see section 2 3) 3) Since the amount of imbalance is known, the experimental\n\n\nresults could be compared to analytical and numerical calculations, as shown throughout this\n\n\nsection _Figure 13: Sweeping_  _b_ _ Modal amplitude at run 0 (a);

    "(29) However, there is a phase  b 0 which leads to a minimum response (except for the case where  1  2,  1 2 ) In this case, there are four unknowns:  1,  2,  1 and  2 (or alternatively, two imbalance\n\n\nmasses and phases at the balancing planes) Finding the four unknowns requires at least four\n\n\nruns with different (known) trial masses at each run Each run includes changing the value of\n\n\n######  b, until  b 0 is reached, hence a nonlinear equation system is constructed, which can be\n\nsolved numerically to find the four unknowns ### Appendix B: Stability Calculation\n\n\nThe stability of the solution, is found by the following eigenvalue problem [35]:\n\n\n\n \n  _a_ _j_  _a_ _j_ \n  _a_ _j_ 1  _j_ 1  **θ** \n \n  _j_  _j_ \n  _a_ _j_ 1  _j_ 1 \n\n\n\n_a_ _a_\n\n\n\n_j_ _j_\n\n\n\n_a_\n\n\n\n_j_ 1 _j_ 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**θ**   **θ** (B1)\n\n\n\n**θ**  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n_j_ _j_\n\n\n\n_a_\n\n\n\n_j_ 1 _j_ 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'\nwhere _a_ _j_  _a_ _j_ 0  _a_ _j_ 1,  _j_  _j_ 0  _j_ 1, and _a_ _j_ 1,  _j_ 1  1, and _a_ _j_ ',  _j_ are shown in Eq (27) (27) The steady state motions are stable if both roots, , have negative real parts ### 5 References\n\n\n[1] I Bucher, D J Ewins, Modal analysis and testing of rotating structures, Philos",
