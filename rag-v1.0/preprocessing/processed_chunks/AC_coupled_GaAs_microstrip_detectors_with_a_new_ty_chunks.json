    "## AC-coupled GaAs microstrip detectors with a new type of integrated bias resistors\n\n### R Irsigler [1], R Geppert, R G¨oppert, M Hornung, J Ludwig, M Rogalla, K Runge, Th Schmid, A S¨oldner-Rembold, M Webel, C Weber\n\nAlbert-Ludwigs-Universit¨at Freiburg, Fakult¨at f¨ur Physik,\nD-79104 Freiburg, Germany\n\n\nFull size single-sided GaAs microstrip detectors with integrated coupling\ncapacitors and bias resistors have been fabricated on 3” substrate wafers PECVD deposited SiO 2 and SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 layers were used to provide coupling capacitaces of 32 5 pF/cm and 61 6 pF/cm, respectively The resistors are made of sputtered CERMET using simple lift of technique The\nsheet resistivity of 78 kΩ/sq and the thermal coefficient of resistance of\nless than 4×10 [−][3] / [◦] C satisfy the demands of small area biasing resistors,\nworking on a wide temperature range 1 Introduction\n\n\nSeveral aspects on the design of a semiconductor microstrip detectors has\nto be taken into account in order to get a good signal to noise ratio First\nof all, the strip capacitance (the sum of the interstrip capacitances between\nneighbouring strips and the body capacitance of the strip) should be low\nbecause it determines the noise level of the readout electronics [1] For short\nshaping times, there is almost no additional contribution due to the shot\nnoise of the detector This is still the case for the higher leakage currents of\nGaAs detectors (∼20 nA/mm [2] ) [2] compared to standard Si detectors (∼0 5\nnA/mm [2] )[3] Short shaping times have to be used because of the very high\nluminosity (10 [34] cm [−][2] s [−][1] ) and high bunch crossing rate (40 MHz) at future\nhigh energy physics experiments like LHC [4]",
    "Short shaping times have to be used because of the very high\nluminosity (10 [34] cm [−][2] s [−][1] ) and high bunch crossing rate (40 MHz) at future\nhigh energy physics experiments like LHC [4] 1 Corresponding author, Tel : +49 761 203 5911, fax: +49 761 203 5931, e-mail:\nirsigler@ruhpb physik uni-freiburg uni-freiburg de\n\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 17 June 2021\n\n\nSecondly, the interstrip capacitance has to be large compared to the body\n(backplane) capacitance of the strip to avoid signal losses to ground Thirdly, the coupling capacitance has to be magnitudes higher compared to\nthe strip capacitance in order to avoid a signal spreading to neighbouring\nstrips [5] Biasing resistors are necessary to drain out the leakage current of the detector In conjunction with the strip capacitors, they act as a low pass filters Values\nin the range of MΩare needed to avoid signal losses to ground In addition strip resistance has to be minimized to reduce dispersion of the\nsignal pulse during penetration at the transmission line of the strip [6] Due to limited space resources, it is not possible to integrate coupling capacitors and bias resistors on VLSI-amplifier chips Hence external capacitor and\nresistor chips have to be used, or they have to be integrated onto the detector On integrated detectors, a reduced number of interconnections have to\nbe made which improves yield and reliability On the other hand additional\nprocessing steps raise cost and complexity of detector fabrication Simplification of processing steps is an essential task in detector design One\nof the major advantages of GaAs detectors is the fact that simple Schottky\ncontacts can be used instead of diffused or implanted pn-contacts in silicon\ntechnology No intermediate p-stops are needed to compensate accumulated\nsurface charge between n-strips Although GaAs substrate wafers are more\nexpensive than Si wafers, a reduced number of masks and processing steps\nmakes GaAs microstrip detectors competitive to standard Si-detectors The design, fabrication and electrical performance of integrated GaAs-microstrip\ndetectors are described in the following sections 2 Wafer design\n\n\nThe wafer design contains several detectors and test structures In accordance\nto the SCT96 layout specification of the ATLAS detector at LHC [7], a keystone detector was designed which covers the main part of the wafer The 6\ncm long detector with 256 strips has a tilt angle of 3 [◦] and a varying pitch\nfrom 80 µm at the top to 68 µm at the bottom of the strips The gap between\nthe strips is constantly 25 µm At the bottom, each strip is connectet via a\nbiasing resistor to the common bias bar In addition, four detectors with a reduced lenght of 1 5 cm, 50 µm pitch and\n256 strips were placed on the wafer design Two of them are detectors with\n\n\n2\n\n\na variable width of the strips (40/30/25/20 µm) which are grouped in 64\nstrips each All detectors are AC-coupled The detectors are surrounded with\nsome test structures to measure the performance of the biasing resistors and\ncoupling capacitances The mask set consists of six layers The first one defines the strips, guard\nring, bond pads and biasing line of the detector The second mask opens the\ncontact windows for the bond pads and the resistors in the dielectric layer The third mask is used for the CERMET resistors The resistor lines lay on\ntop of the dielectric and are connected to the strips and the common biasing\nline via etched holes The serpentine design was selected because of a better\nutilisation of the area The fourth mask defines the top strip metallization for\nthe capacitors and provides vias over the guard ring to the bond pads at the\nfirst level metallization Mask five and six define the backside metallization of\nthe wafer and opens contact holes in the backside passivation",
    "Mask five and six define the backside metallization of\nthe wafer and opens contact holes in the backside passivation Fig 1 shows the integrated CERMET resistors at the end of a 50 µm pitch\nmicrostrip detector The strips are surrounded by a guard ring 3 Device fabrication\n\n\nAll detectors have been designed and fabricated in our laboratory at the Materials Research Center in Freiburg Detectors and test structures of various\ngeometries were processed on 3 in semi insulating GaAs from Freiberger Compound Materials Before deposition of the contacts, wafers were cleaned in acetone and iso-propanol with a subsequent etch in HCl/H 2 O and NH 4 OH/H 2 O 2 /H 2 0 Either Ti/Pt/Au/Ni (10/20/80/5 nm) or Ti/Ti-W/Al/Ti-W (10/10/100/5\nnm) layers were used as first level metallization Depending on the barrier\nlayer, the Schottky contacts are stable up to process temperatures between\n400 [◦] C an 500 [◦] C RBS measurements have shown that the sputtered Ti-W\nbarrier layer exhibits a better performance with respect to the temperature\nstability of the Schottky contact In either case thermal budget is a critical\npoint during detector fabrication The strip resistance was in the range between 150 Ω/cm and 200 Ω/cm for 30 µm wide Strips Single layers of SiO 2 or double layers of SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 were deposited at 300 [◦] C\nin a PECVD process Afterwards contact holes were etched into the dielectric\nlayers to provide interconnections to the resistors and the second level metallization (see Fig",
    "Afterwards contact holes were etched into the dielectric\nlayers to provide interconnections to the resistors and the second level metallization (see Fig 2) The etch mask was also used for a Ni/Au/Ni (10/90/10\nnm) plug fill of the contact holes In the next step, CERMET was sputtered\nonto the wafer to define the resistors after the lift off process Then, the second\nlevel metallization was deposited using either evaporated Ni/Au (10/100 nm)\nlayers or sputtered Al (120 nm) to provide the coupling capacitors 3\n\n\nNext, the front side was covered with photoresist to protect the surface and\nthe originally 625 µm thick wafers were lapped and polished down in a CMP\nprocess to a residual thickness of 200 µm The backside of the wafers were\nO-implanted at an energy of 130 keV with a dose of 1 × 10 [13] cm [−][2] The resulting damage induced isolation layer improves the breakdown behavior at\nfull depletion [8] Afterwards, the backside was patterned photolithographically in a double sided mask aligner to define the backside contact under the\nstrips Sputtered Ti-W/Al (10/120 nm) was used as metallization Finally a\nlayer of PECVD SiO 2 was deposited and etched to protect the backside from\nscratches during handling and mounting of the detectors 4 Interstrip capacitance\n\n\nVariation of the interstrip capacitance with the gap was measured at the variable width detector As expected, the interstrip capacitance is a decreasing\nfunction with the separation of the strips As shown in Fig 3, the interstrip\ncapacitance to the first neighbour strip varies between 1 15 pF/cm at 10 µm\nseparation down to 0 67 pF/cm for a gap of 30 µm The interstrip capacitance\nto the second neighbour strip is about 60 % of this Hence a total strip capacitance in the range between 2 5 pF/cm and 4 5 pF/cm could be expected for\nthe considered detector geometries Demanding a ten times higher coupling\ncapacitance, the coupling capacitance should be in the range between 150 pF\nand 270 pF for 6 cm long strips 5 Coupling capacitors\n\n\nBecause of the poor electric properties of native GaAs oxides (As 2 O 3, Ga 2 O 3 ),\nforeign dielectric materials have to be used in GaAs device processing Materials available for dielectric layers in microelectronics are usually SiO 2, Si 3 N 4,\nAl 2 O 3, Ta 2 O 5 and Polyimide [9] All of those materials are showing some\nstrengths and weaknesses Depending on the deposition technique and conditions the dielectric constant\nis between 4 and 5 for SiO 2 and between 6 and 9 for Si 3 N 4 Usually they\nare deposited in a PECVD process at relatively low temperatures (300 [◦] C) Both layers are easily wet etchable in buffered HF to open contact windows A\ncombination of both layers are often preferred because of the lower breakdown\nvoltage due to pinholes formation in SiO 2 and the high intrinsic stress of Si 3 N 4\nwhen single layers are used [10] Polyimide can be easily spun onto surfaces like a photoresist but require high\n\n\n4\n\n\ncuring temperatures ( > 400 [◦] C) to achieve best dielectric properties Dielectric\nconstant is in the range between 3 and 4 Film thickness is hard to control\nand patterning has to be done using dry etching in an oxygen plasma [9] Al 2 O 3 and Ta 2 O 5 have high dielectric constants of 9 5 and more than 20, respectively",
    "5 and more than 20, respectively Sputtering methods can be used for deposition but surface damage\nand variation of film thickness can be significant[11] Within this work, the materials of choice were single layers of SiO 2 (300 nm)\nand double layers of SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 (100 nm/200 nm) deposited in a PECVD\nprocess Some results are presented in the following section 5 5 1 Measurements\n\n\nAll measurements have been performed on wafer at a probe station using a\nHP 4284 A LCR-meter in parallel mode Fixed frequency measurements were\ndone at 10 kHz with a oscillating level of 200 mV and a DC-bias voltage of 2\nV in accordance to the expected voltage drop at the biasing resistors A comparison between the different dielectric layers is shown in Fig 4 for a\ndetector with variable strip length and in Fig 5 for a detector with variable\nstrip width The calculated dielectric constants for SiO 2 and SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 are\n4 0 and 7 3, respectively 3, respectively For a strip width of 35 mm, the measured coupling\ncapacitances were 23 For a strip width of 35 mm, the measured coupling\ncapacitances were 23 0 ± 0 2 pF/cm and 42 0 ± 0 5 pF/cm, respectively The\nfull size keystone detector with 80 µm pitch, constant gap of 20 µm, constant\nlength of 6 cm and varying width from top to bottom of the strip had a\ncoupling capacitance of 200 pF for SiO 2 and 370 pF for SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4",
    "The\nfull size keystone detector with 80 µm pitch, constant gap of 20 µm, constant\nlength of 6 cm and varying width from top to bottom of the strip had a\ncoupling capacitance of 200 pF for SiO 2 and 370 pF for SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4 As plotted in Fig 6, the coupling capacitance is frequency independent over\na wide range At frequencies above 100 kHz a significant decrease is observed\nfor the full size keystone detector This is due to the fact, that the coupling\ncapacitors have to be treated as a distributed transmission line of finite resistors and capacitors[6] At high frequencies, the effective length of the capacitor\nis reduced, resulting in a lower capacitance This is especially the case when\nimplanted strips in Si-detectors have a high resistivity and were not covered\nwith a metallization layer [1] For the GaAs detector of shorter lengths and\nsmaller resistances, this effect is negligible 6 Biasing resistors\n\n\nUsing lift-off technique, film thickness is normally restricted to less than 200\nnm In width, the resistor area is restricted by the pitch of the strips The\n\n\n5\n\n\nlength should be as small as possible because it acts as a dead part of the\ndetector On the other hand, structures become more sensitive to varying\ndeposition conditions if the dimensions are to small A suitable compromise\nis a resistor area in the rage of 50 µm × 250 µm Hence the sheet resistivity\nof the resistor material must be in the range of 50 - 100 kΩ/sq to achieve\nresistor values in the MΩrange Microstrip detectors in the ATLAS-experiment at LHC has to operate at a\ntemperature of -10 [◦] C for a period of at least 10 years Therefore it is recommended that the resistor material has a low temperature coefficient The requirements of a high sheet resistance, long term stability and weak\ntemperature dependence limits the suitable alternatives for resistor materials Different approaches have been evaluated to integrate biasing structures on\nmicrostrip detectors so far This includes passive components like polysilicon\nresistors [12] as well as active devices like punch-through biasing [13] and\nFOXFET structures[14] Polysilicon has to be deposited at rather high temperatures in a LPCVD process and local implantation steps with post annealing at high temperature has\nto be applied to get a good ohmic junction at the metal strip/polysilicon interface [15] Moreover, if pure Al is used as strip metallization, spiking problems\ncould degrade reliability of the resistors Punch-through biasing needs no extra processing steps but suffers from a\nleakage current dependent dynamic resistance which causes considerable base\nline differences between channels On the FOXFET-structure, a gate electrode covering the punch-through gap\ncontrols the dynamic resistance Unfortunately no integration of FOXFETstructures on GaAs detectors is possible because of the well known pinning of\nthe Fermi level to the middle of the band gap at the dielectric/GaAs interface\n\n[16]\n\n\nThis work is focussed on a new type of biasing resistors for microstrip detectors\nwhich will be discussed in the following section",

    ", respectively In steps of 5 K, I-V curves as a function of temperature between -40 [◦] C and\n+60 [◦] C were measured in a temperature controlled chamber The temperature\nbehavior is described by the thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR), which is\ndefined as:\n\n\n∆R\nα =\nR ∗ ∆T\n\n\nThe TCR α can be calculated from the relative change of resistance ∆R/R\ndue to a temperature change ∆T A comparison of the TCR between the\n\n\n7\n\n\nintegrated CERMET resistors and a external resistor chip [1] is shown in Fig 8 External R-chips are frequently used, if no biasing resistors are integrated on\nthe detector In both cases the TCR is negative and smoothly increasing with\ntemperature For the CERMET resistors a value of -4 × 10 [−][3] / [◦] C at -10 [◦] C\nreaching -2 5 × 10 [−][3] / [◦] C at room temperature was calculated Those TCR\nvalues are even lower than the corresponding values for the external resistors\nand show the good performance of the CERMET Deposition Parameters and resulting resistor values are summarized in Table\n\n1 6 2 1 Homogeneity and yield\n\n\nThe homogeneity of the CERMET resistors over a 256 strip detector is shown\nin Fig 9 Every 10th resistor was measured on a needle probe station Non\nof them exhibited a mal-function due to broken resistor lines or insufficient\ncontact performance Obviously there is a left-right increase in the resistor\nvalue with a small oscillation So far it is not clear, whether this comes from\nthe magnetron sputtering profile or a varying composition in the target The\naverage value was (2 98 ± 0 17) MΩ 7 Conclusions\n\n\nA six mask process for fabricating AC-coupled GaAs microstrip detectors with\na new type of integrated biasing resistors was developed",
