characterised with both electrical and charge collection techniques The height of\nthe Ti-GaAs barrier used was determined via two electrical methods to be 0 81 ± 0 005 and 0 85 ± 0 01 eV The current density was greater than that expected for an ideal Schottky barrier and the excess current was\nattributed to generation current in the bulk of the material A space charge density of 2 8 ± 0 2 × 10 [14] cm [−][3]\n\nwas determined from capacitance voltage characterisation The charge collection efficiency was determined\nfrom front alpha illumination and 60 keV gamma irradiation to be greater than 95% at a reverse bias of\n50 V The diodes were characterised after an exposure to a radiation fluence of 1 25 × 10 [14] 24GeV/c protons cm [−][2] The reverse current measured at 20 [o] C increased from 90 nA to 1500 nA at an applied reverse\nbias of 200 V due to the radiation induced creation of extra generation centres The capacitance measurements showed a dependence upon the test signal frequency which is a characteristic of deep levels The\ncapacitance measured at 5 V reverse bias with a test frequency of 100 Hz fell with radiation from 300 pF to\n40 pF due to the removal of measurable free carriers The charge collection of the device determined from\nfront alpha illumination also fell to 32 ± 5% at a reverse bias of 200 V 1) Dept of Physics & Astronomy, University of

in the future high energy physics experiment ATLAS[1] at the LHC imposes\nsevere demands on the radiation hardness of the detectors Semi-insulating undoped GaAs detectors have\nshown significant charge collection degradation after a 24 GeV/c proton fluence of order 1 × 10 [14] cm [−][2] [2, 3] The increase in the reverse current after this fluence, however, is slight, (in the region of 2-3 times greater) This charge collection reduction can not be tolerated and requires data on the radiation hardness of other\nGaAs materials Epitaxial material with a low initial deep level concentration, and thus high pre-irradiation\ncharge collection efficiency (cce), could provide the necessary radiation tolerance and therefore this material\nwas investigated GaAs detectors are also ideally suited as X-ray imaging detectors for medical applications due to their high\natomic number To obtained the best X-ray images a high charge collection efficiency is required, preferably\nat low bias, and thus a low concentration of deep levels is desired Epitaxial GaAs should be ideal for this\napplication and this application contributed to the motivation of this work ## 2 Experimental\n\n\nThe low pressure vapour phase epitaxial GaAs was grown by Epitronics Corporation[4] on the surface of a\n450 µm thick Hitachi Cable Horizontal Bridgeman GaAs substrate The substrate was n [+] in nature with silicon\ndoping at a concentration of 10 [18] cm [−][3] The VPE layer was n-type and varied in thickness across the wafer\nfrom approximately 240 µm to 125 µm The surface of the VPE layer was chemo-mechanically polished with a\nH 2 O 2 :NH 4 solution at a pH of 7 9±0 1, a process used in the preparation of LEC wafers at Glasgow University[5] This process removed approximately 30 µm from the VPE layer and reduced surface imperfections Circular diodes of 4 mm is diameter were fabricated with metallic electrodes evaporated onto the front\n(VPE side) and back of the material The front Schottky contact was a Ti/Pd/Au multi-layer while the back\nmetallisation was Pd/Ge The rear contact was not annealed and the ohmic contact was realised due to the n [+]\n\nsubstrate Electrical and charge collection characterisation were performed on the diodes The electrical characterisations were carried out at 300 K with the use of a Keithley-237 source measurement unit and a Hewlett Packard\n4274A multi-frequency LCR meter The response of the diodes to alpha particle irradiation from an Am-241\nsource under vacuum and to 60 keV photons from an encapsulated Am-241 source were determined Since\nthe front of the alpha source was coated with surface contamination, which reduced the energy of the alpha\nparticles, the average energy was determined with an over-depleted silicon detector to be 4 1 MeV The diodes\nwere biased and read-out with an EG&G Ortec-142 pre-amplifier The signal was shaped with an Ortec-485\npost-amplifier with a shaping time of 500 ns and sent to a multichannel analyser Four of the VPE diodes were exposed to a fluence of 1 25×10 [14] 24 GeV/c protons cm [−][2] to test their radiation\nhardness The irradiation was performed at the CERN PS[6], Switzerland, at room temperature and without\nbias The diodes were stored for three months at room temperature after irradiation before characterisation No search was made for effects due to annealing over this period ## 3 Pre-irradiation Characteristics\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the current-voltage characteristics of the VPE Schottky diode under both forward and reverse\nbias and demonstrate standard Schottky characteristics for low bias, as shown in figure 1(a) However, at higher\nbias the reverse current did not saturate and continued to increase until diode breakdown at approximately\n180 V From the forward bias characteristic two methods were used to determine the barrier height[7] The first\nfound the value of the saturation current (J s ) from the extrapolation of the current characteristics to zero\nforward bias, shown in figure 2 Using equation 1 with a Richardson constant (A [∗∗] ) of 8 Acm [−][2] K [−][2], the barrier\nheight (φ B ) was found to be 0 81 ± 0 005 V, where the error was due to the uncertainty of A [∗∗] J s = A [∗∗] T [2] exp − [qφ] [B]\n� kT\n\n\n\n(1)\n�\n\n\n\nThis method requires the exact dimensions of the contact area (S e ) to determine the current density The\nsecond method, which utilises the temperature dependence of the forward current, has no such dependence The current was measured at 0 1 V over the temperature range 293 to 308 K The forward current may be\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**1 0**\n\n\n**1**\n\n\n**0 1**\n\n\n**0 01**\n\n\n**0 001**\n\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**1 0**\n\n\n**1**\n\n\n**0 1**\n\n\n**0

01 V The error was found from the error in the linear regression fit to the data Capacitance measurements were performed on the diodes The C-V curves did not show a significant\ndifference between the measurements made with a test signal frequency of 100 Hz and 100 kHz, therefore the\nconcentration of deep levels with a low emission frequency was assumed to be negligible A doping density (N D )\nof 2 8 ± 0 2 × 10 [14] cm [−][3] for the VPE layer was determined from the capacitance voltage characteristics of the\ndevice over a reverse bias range 0-20 V Such a high value has implications for the extension of the depletion\nwidth of the device under reverse bias and thus the charge collection of the device The reverse current characteristic was investigated to determine the cause of non-saturation Figure 3 shows\nthe current voltage dependence up to a reverse bias of 10 V Illustrated on the figure is the current that would\nbe expected for an ideal barrier As can be seen this is considerably less than that measured The effect on\nthe current due to image force lowering of the barrier height for the measured doping density of the material is\nshown as the dotted line in the figure This was insufficient to account for the observed current The current\nwas assumed to be generation current and a fit of the form:\n\n\n\nJ gen = [qn] 2τ [i] r [w] = P (1)(φ b − V n − kT/q + V

line - the result of the fit of equation\n(3) was performed to the data, where P (1) and P (2) were free parameters, n i the intrinsic carrier concentration, w\nthe depletion width, and τ r the lifetime of the free carriers The value of V n was calculated from:\n\n\n\nN C\nq [ln] � N D\n\n\n\nV n = [kT]\n\n\n\nN D\n\n\n\n(4)\n�\n\n\n\nwhere N C is the effective density of states in the conduction band The values obtained for the parameters were: P (1) = 0 66 ± 0 02 nA/mm [2] and P (2) = 0 53 ± 0 02 For\ngeneration current the expected value of P (2) = 0 5 which corresponds to that found and therefore the current\nwas attributed to generation effects The activation energy of the current at -10V was found to equal 0 73 ±\n0 02 eV which is equal, within errors, to half the bandgap energy The generation current was not likely to be\ndue to the mid-gap donor EL2, as is the case in LEC material, because the concentration of this deep level was\nlow From the capacitance voltage measurements the depletion width as a function of bias was determined up to\na bias of 180V, as shown in figure 4 At 100 V the depletion depth was only 22 3 µm, increasing to 27 4 µm at\n150 V The low values were due to the high density of donors in the material The low depletion depth and the\nhigh current resulted in the signal from a high energy beta particle being indistinguishable from the electronic\nnoise of the device For a 100% cce the signal would equal only 3600 electrons at a bias of 150 V The cce\ndetermined for 60 keV gamma photons was 97 ± 17% at a bias of 200V The error is due to the spread in the\npeak due to the high leakage current of the device at this bias Due to the 450 µm thick n [+] layer on the back\nside of the device the detector was only sensitive to alpha particle illumination from the front surface Although\nthe range of 4 1 MeV alpha particles in GaAs is only ∼ 13µm, due to the comparably small depletion region\nthe detector response was no longer due primarily to one charge carrier The charge collection efficiency as a\nfunction of both bias and depletion depth, calculated from the CV data, are shown in figure 5 for two VPE\ndiodes The charge collection showed the expected increase with bias due to the increase in depletion width The maximum cce’s for the two detectors were 100±7% and 93±7% at a bias close to 150 V The cce plateaued\nfor a depletion width between 10 µm and 15 µm as expected from the alpha particle range in GaAs At zero\napplied bias, however, the depletion width, calculated from the capacitance measurements, was only 2 µm but\na signal of 65% of the full alpha particle signal was obtained Therefore diffusion or drift of charge into the\ndepletion region must occur ## 4 Post-irradiation Characteristics\n\n\nFigure 6 illustrates the significant change in the current characteristics after the 1 25×10 [14] cm [−][2] proton fluence The reverse current increased in the operating region of the detector and was ≈85

is: dot-dashed line - reverse current before; solid line reverse current after; dashed line - forward current after irradiation The forward current before irradiation is\nindistinguishable from the current axis on this figure 150 V compared to only 4 6 nA/mm [2] before irradiation The forward current on the other hand was reduced\nafter the fluence The current characteristic was more resistive in nature and thus the resistivity of the material\nhad increased This implies that the product of the mobility and the free carrier concentration was reduced A reduction in mobility is very likely as the increased number of defect centres will increase the concentration\nof scattering centres and thus reduce the mobility The free carrier concentration will be reduced if deep levels\nare introduced which compensate the material and thus cause the Fermi level to approach mid-bandgap The\nactivation energy of the reverse current was measured at a bias of -10V and -100V to be 0 57 ± 0 01 eV if\ngeneration current was assumed The change in activation energy was due to the presence of radiation induced\ndeep levels The capacitance-voltage relationship shows a dependence upon the frequency of the test signal used to make\nthe measurement, illustrated in figure 7(a) The high frequency capacitance did not change with bias This\nis characteristic of measurements made on high resistivity material where the capacitance measured with a\nhigh frequency test signal equals the geometrical capacitance of the device[5] For this diode the measured\ncapacitance at 100 kHz was 13 pF The thickness of the VPE layer was not measured directly but a device of\nthis capacitance implies that the diode is 110µm thick, which is in the expected range for the thickness of the\nVPE material The capacitance voltage dependence before and after irradiation are compared in figure 7(b) The measured\ncapacitance at a given bias fell and at -5 V was only 40 pF compared to 300 pF As the measured capacitance\ndepends upon the density of free carriers and the density of traps which have emission rates greater than\nthe frequency of the A C test voltage, the reduction in the measured capacitance implies that the density of\nthese carriers was reduced Therefore a significant concentration of deep levels was created in the material\ndue to the proton fluence The effective trap concentration (N eff ) was deduced from the 1/C [2] bias voltage\ndependence shown in figure 8, measured between -5 V and -30 V, to be only 1 3 × 10 [13] cm [3] The reduction\nin free carrier density measured as a fall in N eff and as an increase in resistivity implies that either acceptor\n(electron) traps have been introduced and/or that the Fermi level has been lowered, resulting in a lower free\ncarrier concentration Lowering of the Fermi level will be caused by an increased concentration of deep levels\nthat remove electrons from the conduction band, that is acceptor levels The charge collection efficiency of the irradiated device was investigated Again results from high energy\nbeta particles could not be obtained due to leakage current noise The increase in reverse current also prevented\nthe detection of 60 keV photons Charge collection from front illumination by alpha particles was obtained and\nis illustrated in figure 9 as a function of bias The cce fell from ∼100% before irradiation to 32 ± 4% measured\nat 200V The diode did not breakdown until higher voltages and a cce of 55% was measured at the highest\npossible voltage of 480 V ## 5 Comparison to LEC

dashed line - LEC\n\n\nLEC diode After irradiation, however, the reverse current of the VPE diode increased dramatically by over an\norder of magnitude, but, for the LEC diode the increase was only by a factor of two at a reverse bias of 100 V The charge collection of the VPE diode was higher than the LEC diode both before and after irradiation It should be noted, however, that the VPE diode had a depletion width of only ∼30µm and therefore the effect\nof a short absorption length will be less significant ## 6 Conclusions\n\n\nThe Schottky diodes fabricated with VPE GaAs behaved according to simple theory, that is without the presence\nof a significant concentration of deep traps Titanium-GaAs barrier heights of 0 81 ± 0 005eV and 0 85 ± 0 01 eV\nwere measured which are closed to those quoted in the literature The reverse current-voltage characteristic\ndid not saturate, an effect attributed to generation current in the depletion region The donor concentration\nwas obtained via CV analysis of the material to be 2 8 ± 0 2 × 10 [14] cm [−][3], which prevented the extension of the\ndepletion region beyond ∼30 µm before breakdown occurred, due to the high bias required (>200 V) Charge\ncollection experiments were limited due to the small depletion region The charge collection efficiencies obtained\nfrom front alpha particle and 60keV gamma irradiation were close to 100% After a 24GeV/c proton fluence of 1 25 × 10 [14] cm [−][2] the VPE diode had a reverse current density measured\nat 100V reverse bias and 300 K, of 5 3 × 10 [−][6] Acm [−][2] This may be compared to 2 8 × 10 [−][6] Acm [−][2] for an\nLEC diode after the same fluence The current increase for the VPE diode was over an order of magnitude It must be noted, however, that the VPE diode was not guarded and a guarded ring could reduce the current\ndue to a reduction in surface currents Deep levels were introduced From the increase in resistance and the\ncapacitance-voltage dependence the deep levels were appear to be acceptors A fall in charge collection efficiency\nfrom front alpha illumination was observed and at a reverse bias of 200 V the cce fell from 100% to 32 ± 5% In comparison with a typical LEC diode the VPE diode had a lower leakage current before irradiation, but\nthis was not true after the radiation fluence Charge collection from a SI-U detector was considerably worse\nthan in the VPE device both before and after the radiation fluence The small depletion width of the VPE\ndiode, however, means that the results can not be directly compared The material could be very promising for detector development if the free carrier concentration can be\nreduced to allow an increased depletion width The materials radiation hardness is still a cause for concern ## 7 Acknowledgements\n\n\nThe authors would like to thank F McDevitt, A Meikle and F Doherty for technical support and all those at the\nCERN PS facility during the irradiation run One of us (R Bates) gratefully acknowledges the support received\nthrough a CASE postgraduate studentship from RAL The results obtained within the RD8 collaboration are\n\n\nfrom work partly funded by PPARC (UK), INFN (Italy), and the BMFD (Germany) ## References\n\n\n[1] ATLAS Collaboration ATLAS Technical Proposal for a General-Purpose pp Experiment at the Large\nHadron Collider at CERN CERN, LHCC 94-43, 1994 [2] V O’Shea et al, IEEE Trans Nucl Sci 44 No 5 (1997)\n\n\n[3] M Rogalla Rogalla Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, A395(1997) [4] R Adams Adams Low Pressure Vapour Phase Epitaxy Technologies Proc of the 4 [th] International GalliumArsenide Workshop and related compounds, Aberfoyle, 1996 To be published in Nucl Instr Instr and Meth\nA [5] R Bates Gallium Arsenide Radiation Detectors for the ATLAS Experiment Bates Gallium Arsenide Radiation Detectors for the ATLAS Experiment PhD thesis, Dept Of Physics,\nUniversity of Glasgow, June 1997 [6] M Tavlet First European conference on radiation and its effects on devices and systems, ESA-IEEE Universite Montpellier II, France, 1991 [7] S M Sze Sze Physics of Semiconductor Devices Physics of Semiconductor Devices John Wiley & Sons, 2nd edition, 1981"
