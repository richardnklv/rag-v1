    "**2 Literature Review**\n\nThe RoboCup Federation is located in Switzerland and\nhas about forty member countries Since 1997, the Robot\nWorld Cup Soccer Games and Conferences, managed by\nthe RoboCup Federation, are held every year The\nultimate goal of the RoboCup project is, by 2050, to\ndevelop a team of fully autonomous humanoid robots\n\n\n207\n\n\nthat can win against the human world champion team in\nsoccer games Currently, RoboCup has five leagues, _i e _\nSimulation League, Small Size Robot League, Middle\nSize Robot League, Sony Legged Robot League and\nHumanoid League The main focus of this paper is the\nSimulation League In RoboCup Simulation League, the game platform is\nSoccerServer issued by the RoboCup Federation SoccerServer simulates a virtual game environment with\ntwo dimensions, the player controlled by Client can run\nand kick on the playground Each team has 11 players\nand each player is an autonomous subject and can\ncommunicate with SoccerServer by UDP/IP [2] The\nmain functions of SoccerServer are to act as the referee\nas well as to accept and manage the request of players\nfrom each team, calculate the position and velocity of\neach object on the playground by mechanical theorem\nand send the aural and visual message to each player on\nthe playground The message each player gets from\nSoccerServer is accompanied by noise, and the player-toplayer communication is only one-way and unreliable\n\n[3] On the playground, balls and players have such\nattributes as size, position, velocity and acceleration, etc Moreover, the player also has the attributes of direction\nand physical force Although the Deep Blue had beaten the human world\nchampion in chess, the Robot still has a long way to go\nbefore the final success is achieved The main\n\ndifferences between chess and soccer are showed in table\n\n1[4] |Col1|Chess|RoboCup|\n|---|---|---|\n|Environment|Static|Dynamic|\n|State Change|Turn taking|Real time|\n|Info accessibility|Complete|Incomplete|\n|Sensor Readings|Symbolic|Non-symbolic|\n|Control|Central|Distributed|\n\n\n\nTable 1 Comparison of Chess and RoboCup\n\nThese differences show that each robot in RoboCup\nshould be an autonomous subject that can collaborate\nwith his teammates, and a RoboCup team should be a\nmulti-subject system that allows inner cooperation On\nthe contrary, Deep Blue essentially is a program that can\nsearch 60 billion chess manuals in few minutes Just for\nthese reasons, to design RoboCup simulation team is a\npiece of work full of special techniques To give\ndifferent decision algorithms for different tactics is a\npopular method, and has been illustrated by all of the\nRoboCup simulation teams that had published their\ndecision algorithms For instance, Tsinghua University's\nteam, the RoboCup simulation world champion team in\n\n\n\n2001, used five different decision algorithms for ball\nhandling, pass, shoot, interception and the movement of\nthe players that do not control the ball [5] Furthermore,\nno obvious relationships between these five different\ntactics can be found currently The experience of earlier edition of NOVAURO® shows\nthat how to coordinate the relationships between these\nalgorithms and how to chose the proper input parameters\nare the dilemma of such method mentioned above For\ninstance, NOVAURO® beat \"11 monkeys\", a RoboCup\nsimulation team, with 9:0 in a test match, but we lost\nsubsequently with 0:3 when just an input parameter had\nbeen changed Nobody knew how to work out the\noptimum parameters, even after the math professors were\nconsulted And this is why most of RoboCup simulation\nteams are ready to publish their decision algorithm but\ntheir input parameters, the most valuable wealth derived\nfrom repetitious interior test",
    "And this is why most of RoboCup simulation\nteams are ready to publish their decision algorithm but\ntheir input parameters, the most valuable wealth derived\nfrom repetitious interior test **3 The Principle of Decision-making Model Building**\n\n_3 1 Make Decisions under the Environment Provided by_\n_RoboCup SoccerServer_\nRoboCup SoccerServer provides a simulation\nenvironment similar to a real soccer game, but some\ndifferences do exist, and all of the decisions must be\nmade under such a given environment For instance, the\nfield provided by RoboCup SoccerServer is a 2dimension surface, so any study of the ball flight in air is\nmeaningless For more details about RoboCup\nsimulation, please visit its official website at\nhttp://www robocup org _3 2 Use Mature Tactics in Soccer Games to Guide_\n_Decision-making Model Design_\nVia \"Soccer Coach Manual\" and investigation of some\nsoccer players, we select the vertical distance to the\nrivals’ goal line and our shooter’s visual angle for the\ngoalpost as fundamental parameters to design the\ndecision-making model We also design the “vertical\npass incline arrive” and “incline pass vertical arrive” as\nthe scoring tactics (Fig 1, 2) _3 3 Decision Formalized and Task Decomposed_\nBecause the match is held in an environment provided by\nRoboCup SoccerServer, so all of the decision-making\nmodels must be formalized and ultimately executed by\ncomputer As a principle, a complex task is usually decomposed\ninto some smaller and easier ones in a project Similarly,\nalmost all of the popular RoboCup simulation teams\nadopt this hierarchical tactics [6] Fig 1 Vertical pass inclined arrive",

_Hypothesis of Shoot Success Efficiency_\nIn our research, we find the factors that affect shooting\nsuccess are as follow: (Fig 3)\n\n\nFig 3 Factors influencing shooting success (1) Vertical distance from the shooting agent to the\nopponent goal line, marked as _d_ ;\n(2) Visual angle from the shooting agent to the\nopponent goalpost, marked as α;\n(3) Shooting agent's ability, marked as _f;_\n(4) The degree of the opponent agents’ interference\nwith our shooting agent, marked asξ;\n\n\n\n_2) Basic Hypotheses_\n(1) If the ball is placed on the opponent goal line and\nno opponent agents interference exists, _i e d=0,_ α _=π,_\n_ξ=0,_ scoring will be a certainty (Fig 4) _(hypothesis1)_\n_3)_ _Shooting Success Evaluation Function_\n(2) If the ball is situated on the opponents’ extended\ngoal line, _i e d =0,_ α _=0,_ scoring is impossible (Fig 5) _(hypothesis 2)_ [Though at the real soccer game this\nsituation also can be scored, but in Robocup it’s\nimpossible ]\n(3) Shooting success is in direct proportion with α and\n_f_, where α is the visual angle from the shooting agent to\nthe opponents’ goalpost and _f_ is the ability of the\nshooting agent _(hypothesis 3)_\n(4) Shoot success is in inverse proportion with d [2] and\nξ, where _d_ is the vertical distance from the shooting\nagent to the opponents’ goal line and ξ is the degree of\nthe opponent agents interference with the shooting agent _(hypothesis 4)_ Where α is the visual angle from the shooting agent to\nthe opponents’ goalpost, _f_ is the ability of the shooting\nagent, _d_ is the vertical distance from the shooting agent\nto the opponents’ goal line and ξ is the degree of the\nopponent agents interference with shoot agent Fig 4 Football placed on goal line Fig 5 Football placed on extend goal line **Model 1**\n\n_Shooting_ _ _Success_ ( _d_, α, _f_, ξ ) = {1( + 1 _d_ ) 2 ⋅απ + _f_ max _f_ ⋅ 1( ⋅α+ _d_ ) ⋅π ⋅ 1[ − 1( + 1 _d_ ) 2 ⋅απ ]} ⋅ 1 + 1 ξ (1)\n\n\n\n_4) Properties of Shooting_Success Function_\nWe can easily calculate the following result: (“ ≡ ” is\nidentity sign)\n\n- Shooting_Success(0,π,f,0) ≡ 1 (satisfy _hypothesis1_ in\n\nthis paper);\n\n- Shooting_Success(0,0,f,ξ) ≡ 0 (satisfy _hypothesis 2_\n\nin this paper);\nWe can prove that _Shooting_Success_ function also meets\nthe requirement of _hypothesis 3_ and _hypothesis 4_ in this\npaper by mathematical method, but we will not give the\nfull demonstration due to limited space The diagrams of\n_Shooting_Success_ function drawn by Mathcad 2000\nshow clearly that as _d_ and ξincrease, the value of\n_Shoot_Success_ function will decrease, while as α and _f_\nincrease, the value of _Shoot_Success_ function will also\nincrease The value region of _Shooting_Success_ function\nfalls on [0, 1] _5) Preferences of Shooting_Success Function_\nValues of _d_ and _f_ can be calculated by functions provided\nby RoboCup SoccerServer α can be calculated by the\nfollowing formula:\n\n\n\nWhere (x, y) is the plotting of the shooting agent, (x1,\ny1) is the plotting of the opponents’ left goalpost, (x2,\ny2) is the plotting of the opponents’ right goalpost Values of ξ are discrete and determined by the number of\nthe opponent agents and their distance to the shooting\nagent within his visual angle Given ξ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, …}\nand as the value increase, the interference to the shooting\nagent will duly increase _4 2 Defensive Evaluation Function_\nDefensive evaluation function is derived from\n_Shooting_Success_ function, because the defensive\nRoboCup simulation team believes:\nFirstly, it should prevent the opponent agent who\ncontrols the ball from going ahead to its goal line in the\nvertical direction, because _d_ has a higher right in\n_Shoot_Success (d,_ α _, f, ξ) _\nSecondly, it should let the opponent shooting agent have\nthe smallest visual angle for its goalpost 209\n\n\n\nα = arccos ( _x_ 1 − _x_ ) ⋅ ( _x_ 2 − _x_ ) + ( _y_ 1 − _y_ ) ⋅ ( _y_ 2 − _y_ ) (2)\n\n\n\n( _x_ 1 − _x_ ) ⋅ ( _x_ 2 − _x_ ) + ( _y_ 1 − _y_ ) ⋅ ( _y_ 2 − _y_ )\narccos\n\n\n\n_x_ − _x_ ⋅ _x_ − _x_ + _y_ − _y_ ⋅ _y_ − _y_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Model 2**\n\n\n1 α\nDefensive(d, α ) = 2 ⋅ (3)\n1( + _d_ ) π\n\n\nWhere _d_ is the vertical distance from the defensive\nlocation to its goal line and α is the visual angle from the\ndefensive location to its goalpost _1) Properties of Defensive Evaluation Function_\n(1) For α�[0,π], _d_ ≥0,\nso the range of Defensive(d, α) falls on [0, 1] (2) For α≥0, _d_ ≥0,\n\n\n\nso ∂ Defensive( ∂ d d, α ) = − 2 πα ⋅ 1( + 1 _d_ ) 3 [≤]

goalpost is\nconstant, the aim of defense is to let the opponent agent\nhave the longest vertical distance to the goal line Fig 6",

    "This is\nconsistent with real soccer match that a midfielder\n\nshould connect its forwardline and backline increases, the value of Defensive(d, α) function\nincreases So when the vertical distance to the goal line is\nconstant, the aim of defense is to let the opponent agent\nhave the smallest visual angle Because circle angles on the same arch are equal, all the\nlocations have the same visual angle to the goalpost on\nthe arch whose bowstring falls on the goal line (Fig Because circle angles on the same arch are equal, all the\nlocations have the same visual angle to the goalpost on\nthe arch whose bowstring falls on the goal line (Fig 6)\n\n**5 Offensive Decision**\n\n_5 1 Offensive Decisions of Individual Agents_\nThis kind of decisions requires the agent that controls the\nball to calculate its _Shooting_Success_ value in every\nRoboCup SoccerServer time-cycle If its value is greater\nthan the shooting critical value we have given in\nadvance, then the agent will execute the shooting action _e g _ if the shooting critical value is 0 6, it means the\nchance of scoring is 60% Else it will intercept the\n_Shooingt_Success_ values sent via \" _say_ \", a command\nprovided by RoboCup SoccerServer, by its teammates\nwho are free, then the agent will pass the ball to a\nteammate agent who has a higher _Shooting_Success_\nvalue If no such a teammate agent exists, it will move to\na new location with a higher _Shooting_Success_ value Repeat the above process until it executes the shoot\naction or its ball is intercepted by an opponent agent 210\n\n\nFig 7 Decision coupling trees Fig 8 Partition area of 4-4-2 formation",

    "Suppose the defensive agent is\ntrapped in part extremum, if the scenario as mentioned\nabove emerges, then the agent will jump out of part\n\nextremum **7 Reliability of Communication**\n\nSince the game environment offered by RoboCup\nSoccerServer is a noisy one, the vision and hearing of the\nagents in the field are all interfered Generally speaking,\nthe intensity of interference is in direct proportion with\nthe distance between communication objects When the\ndistance is 100 0, the maximum of noise is up to 10 0,\n\n\n\nWhere _d_ is the distance between communication agents If the value of _Believe(d)_ function is less than a certain\nvalue given in advance, then we believe this\ncommunication is trustless, _i e _ the message received\nunder such circumstance can not be used as a decision\n\nbedrock **8 ** **Algorithm** **of** **NOVAURO®** **vs ** **Tsinghua**\n**University’s RoboCup Simulation Team**\n\n\n\nTsinghua University's RoboCup simulation team is the\nworld champion in 2001 The following table (Table 2)\nshows the differences of decision algorithms between\nNOVAURO® and Tsinghua's team in some ta ctics These differences show that almost all of the decision\nalgorithms of NOVAURO® for each tactics in soccer are\nbased on the calculating results of _Shoot_Success(d,α,_\n_f,ξ)_ function and its derived function _Defensive(d�α)_,\nwhereas the Tsinghua's team gives difference algorithms\nfor different tactics The decision model of\n\nNOVAURO® shows that different tactics should be\ninterrelated in a soccer match but not disrupted, and it is\na general one in a sense Because the key parameters\nused by the decision algorithm of NOVAURO®, such as\n\n\n211\n\n\n_d, α, f_ etc, are derived from real time soccer matches\nother than selected by man and do not need repeated\ntests, such a RoboCup simulation team is easier to be\nimplemented and cost less",
