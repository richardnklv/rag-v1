    "As a\nresult, product (1 1) cannot be used for possible coverings of current physical theories In view of the above occurrence, Santilli introduced in 1967 [2] a new notion of Lieadmissibility which is Albert’s definition [loc In view of the above occurrence, Santilli introduced in 1967 [2] a new notion of Lieadmissibility which is Albert’s definition [loc cit cit ], plus the condition that the algebras U\n\n\n1\n\n\nadmit Lie algebras in their classification or, equivalently, that the generalized Lie product\nadmits the conventional one as a particular case As an illustration, we introduced the the algebra with product (Ref [2], Eq (8), p 573)\n\n\n(A, B) = p × A × B − q × B × A, (1 2)\n\n\nand related time evolution in the infinitesimal and finite forms (¯h = = 1) [3,4]\n\n\ni × dA/dt = p × A × Hq × H × A,\n\n\nA(t) = {e [i][×][q][×][H][×][t] } × A(0) × {e [−][i][×][p][×][t][×][H] }, (1 3)\n\n\nwhere: p and q are non-null parameters with non-null values p ± q It is easy to see that\nproduct (1 2) is Lie- and Jordan-admissible and admits the Lie and Jordan products as\nparticular (nondegenerate) cases Structures (1 2) and (1 3) resulted to be insufficient for physical applications because, as\nwe shall see in Sect 3, the parameters p and q become operators under the time evolution of\nthe theory We therefore introduced in 1978 [5] (see also monograph [6] of 1983) the notion\nof general Lie-admissibility which is the notion of ref [1] plus the conditions that algebras\nU admit Lie-isotopic [5,6] (rather then Lie) algebras in their attached antisymmetric form\nand admit ordinary Lie algebras in their classification The latter notion was realized via the generalLie − admissibleproduct (first introduced\nin ref",
    "The latter notion was realized via the generalLie − admissibleproduct (first introduced\nin ref [5b], p 719; see Ref [6] for a more detailed treatment)\n\n\n(A, B) = A × P × B − B × Q × A, (1 4)\n\n\nand time evolution in infinitesimal and finite forms (Ref [5b], pp 741, 742, and [6])\n\n\ni × dA/dt = A × P × H − H × Q × A,\n\n\nA(t) = {e [i][×][H][×][Q][×][t] } × A(0) × {e [−][i][×][t][×][P][ ×][H] }, (1 5)\n\n\nwhere H is Hermitean but P and Q are nonsingular, generally nonhermitean matrices or\noperators with non-singular values P ± Q admitting of the parametric values p and q as\nparticular cases The conventional Heisenberg’s equations are evidently recovered for P =\nQ = 1 Note that the attached products [A, B] U = (A, B) − (B, A) = A × T × B − B × T × A,\nT = P +Q, and {A, B} U = (A, B)+(B, A) = A×T ×B +B ×T ×A, T = P −Q, are still\nLie and (commutative) Jordan, respectively, although of a more general type called isotopic\n\n[5,6] Note also that the P and Q operators must be sandwiched in between the elements A\nand B to characterize an algebra as commonly understood in mathematics [5,6] It should\nbe finally indicated that, when properly written, Hamilton’s equations with external terms\npossess precisely a Lie-admissible structure In 1989 Biedenharn [7] and Macfarlane [8] introduced the so-called q-deformations, with\na structure of the type\n\n\nA × B − B × A → A × B − q × A × B; (1 6)\n\n\n2\n\n\nwhich were followed by a number of papers so large to discourage an outline (see, e g ,\nrepresentative papers [9]) More recently, other types of deformations of relativistic quantum\nformulations appeared in the literature under the name of k-deformations (see, e",
    "More recently, other types of deformations of relativistic quantum\nformulations appeared in the literature under the name of k-deformations (see, e g , Ref s\n\n[10], quantum groups (see, e g Ref s [11]) and others generalizations It is evident that\ntheories of type(1 6) are a particular case of the broader Lie-admissible theories (1 2) and\n(1 4) Unfortunately, even thouygh mathematically impeccable, all the above theories have resulted to possess a number of physiocal shortcomings investigated in Ref Unfortunately, even thouygh mathematically impeccable, all the above theories have resulted to possess a number of physiocal shortcomings investigated in Ref s [19,23] s [19,23] As a\nnecessary condition to exit the class of equivalence of quantum mechanics, Lie-admissible\ntheories, q-deformations, k-deformations, quantum groups, and all that must have a nonunitary time evolution, U × U [†] ≠ I When the these theories are formulated on conventional\nspaces over conventional fields, the following physical shortcomings are simply unavoidable:\n\n\n(1) Lack of invariance of the fundamental unit (that of the enveloping operator algebra),\nbecause under nonunitary transforms we have I → I′ = U × I × U [†] = U ×\nU [†] ≠ I This implies lack of invariance of the basi= c units of space and time,\nwith consequential lack of unambiguous application of the theories to experiments,\nbecause it is not possible to conduct a meaningful measurement, say, of a length, with\na stationary meter changing in time (2) Lack of conservation of the Hermiticity in time, with consequential lack of physically\nacceptable observables (see Sect 3 for more details) (3) Lack of invariance of physical laws, e g , because of the lack of invariance of the deformed brackets under the time time evolution of the theory (4) Lack of uniqueness and invariance of numerical predictions, because of the lack of\nuniqueness (e g , in the exponentiation) and invariance (e g",
    "g , of special functions and\ntransforms) needed for data elaboration (for instance, the ”q-parameter” becomes a ”Qoperator” under a nonunitary transform, Q = q × U × U [†], with consequential evident\nloss of all original special functions and transforms constructed for the q-parameter) (5) Loss of the axioms of the special relativity, an occurrence of all generalizations under\nconsideration, evidently because deformed spaces and symmetries are no longer isomorphic to the original ones This creates the sizable problems of: first, identifying\nnew axioms capable of replacing Einstein’s axioms; second, proving their axiomatic\nconsistency; and, third, establishing them experimentally In this note we shall present a conceivable resolution of the above physical shortcomings\nbased on the use of a new mathematics called genomathematics, as recently identified in\nmemoir [12] To render the note self-sufficient, we shall first outline in Sect 2 the rudiments\nof the genomathematics and then indicate in Sect 3 the invariant formulation of (p, q)- and\n(P, Q)-deformations The reader should keep in mind that the most serious shortcoming of generalized theories\nunder consideration in this note is the loss of Einstein’s axioms Our primary objective is\ntherefore to attempt the formulation of generalized theories in such a way to preserve the\naxioms of the special relativity, although in generalized spaces and fields If achieved, this\nresult will be sufficient, alone, to resolve all possible physical shortcomings 3\n\n\n## 2 GENOMATHEMATICS\n\nThe main idea of the Lie-admissible theory [6] is that its structure (1 5) is inherent in the\nconventional Lie theory In fact, a one-parameter connected Lie group realized via Hermitean\noperators X = X [†] on a Hilbert space H has in reality the structure of a bi-module (also\ncalled in nonassociative algebras spit-null extension,see, e",
    "In fact, a one-parameter connected Lie group realized via Hermitean\noperators X = X [†] on a Hilbert space H has in reality the structure of a bi-module (also\ncalled in nonassociative algebras spit-null extension,see, e g , Ref [13]) In nontechnical terms, the structure of a Lie group as a bimodule is essentially characterized by an action from the left U [>] and an action from the right [<] U with explicit realization\nand interconnecting conjugation\n\n\nA(t) = U [>] × Q(0) × [<] U = {e [i][×][X] [>] `[×]` [w] } > A(0) < {e [−][i][×][w][×] [<] [X] } =\n= (I [>] + i × X [>] × w + ) > A(0) < ( [<] I − i × w × [<] X + ),\nU [>] = ( [<] U) [†] = U [>], X [>] = ( [<] X) [†] = X, Iˆ [>] = < I = I, (2 1)\n\n\n(where w is a Lie parameter and the multiplications > and < represent conventional associative products ordered to the right and to the left, respectively) The infinitesimal version\nin the neighborhood of the unit then acquires the familiar form\n\n\ni[A(dw) − A(0))/dw = A < X − X > A = A × X − X × A, (2 2)\n\n\nwhich clarifies that in the product AxX = A < X(X × A = X > A), X in actuality acts\nfrom the right (from the left) The bimodular structure is generally ignored in the conventional formulation of Lie’s\ntheory because un-necessary In fact, in a Lie bimodule { [<] H, H [>] }, where [<] H = H [>] =\nH is a conventional Hilbert space, the modular action to the right and to the left are\ninterconnected with the simple bimodular rules [14] X [×] - ψ [>] = X × ψ = − [<] ψ < [<]\n\nX = −ψ × X, where ψ [>] ∈H [>], [<] ψ ∈ [<] H, X [>] is an element of the universal enveloping\nassociative algebra ξ [>] (L) of the considered Lie algebra L ≈ [ξ [>] (L)] [−] for the action to the\nright and [<] X ∈ [<] ξ(L) [14] Since H [>] = < H = H, and ξ [>] (L) = < ξ(L) = ξ(L) The bireprsentations of the bimodular structure { [<] ξ(L), ξ [>] (L)} over { [<] H, H [>] } can then be\neffectively reduced to the one-sided representations, or just representations for short, of ξ(L)\nover H, as well known However, as we shall see shortly, the original bimodular structure of\nLie’s theory is no longer trivial for broader realizations of axioms (2",
    "However, as we shall see shortly, the original bimodular structure of\nLie’s theory is no longer trivial for broader realizations of axioms (2 1) Lie-admissible structure (1 5) was proposed [5b] on the basis of the mere observation\nthat the abstract axioms of the bimodular structure (2 1) do not necessarily require that\nthe multiplications > and < must be conventional, because they can also be generalized,\nprovided that they remain associative In other word, the abstract axiomatic structure of\nthe action from the right, U [>] - A(0) is that of a right modular associative action, with no\nrestriction on the realization of the associative product, and the same occurs for the action\nfrom the left A(0) < [<] U The simplest possible broadening of the Lie version is given by the isotopies of Lie’s\ntheory, first proposed in Ref s [5], then studied in various works (see Ref [6] for a comprehensive presentation as of 1983), and it is called the Lie-Santilli isotheory (see, e g , Refs [15-18]) It is essentially characterized by the lifting of the conventional right modular associative product U [>] - A(0) = U [>] × T × A(a) with conjugate from the left A(0) < [<] U,\n\n\n4\n\n\nwhere T = T [†] is a fixed, well behaved, nowhere singular and Hermitean matrix or operator\nof the same dimension of the considered representation Its inverse I [ˆ] = T [−][1] is then a fully\nacceptable, generalized, left and right unit, I × A = A > I [ˆ] = I < A [ˆ] = A < I [ˆ] = I [ˆ] for\nall possible elements A The isotopies then require, for mathematical and physical consistency, the reconstruction\nof the entire Lie theory with respect to the new unit I [ˆ] and isoproduct > = < = × [ˆ], including:\nnumbers and fields; vector, metric and Hilbert spaces; Lie algebras, groups and symmetries;\ntransformation and representation theories; etc [15-18] This intermediate level of study\nalso possesses a trivial bimodular structure, in the sense that its two-sided representations\ncan be effectively reduced to the one-sided form Following the prior achievement of sufficient mathematical maturity in Ref [12], the\nphysical profiles of the isotopic realization of axioms (2 1) have been studied in details in the\nrecent memoir [19], including most importantly the resolution of problematic aspects (1)-(5)\nof the preceding section A knowledge of Ref [19] is useful for a technical understanding of\nthis note Our objective is the realization of the abstract axioms of bimodular structure (2 1) via\nthe generalized associative laws originally submitted in Ref [5b] of 1978, under the name of\ngenoassociative multiplication and unit (or genomultiplication and genounit for short), then\nstudies in Ref s [6,20], and more recently studied in details in Ref [12],\n\n\nA > B = A × P × B, A < B = A × Q × B,\n\n\nIˆ [>] = P [−][1], I [>]    - A = A > ˆI [>] = A, < I = = Q −1, < I < A = A < < I = A,\n\nˆ ˆ\nI [>] = P [−][1] = ( [<] I) [†] = Q [†], (2 3)\n\n\nwhere P ≠ Q are well behaved, everywhere invertible, nonhermitean matrices or operators generally realized via real-valued nonsymmetric matrices of the same dimension of the\nconsidered Lie representation Moreover, it is requested that that P + Q and P − Q are\nnonsingular to preserve a well defined Lie and Jordan content, respectively To differentiate\nforms (2 3) from the isotopic ones, I called them genotopic in Ref [5], to denote their character of inducing a more general realization I [>] and [<] I and then called genotopic units and\nP and Q the genotopic elements Broader products and units (2 3) characterize the following more general realization of\nthe abstract axioms (2 1) I tentatively called Lie-admissible transformation group [5,6,12,20]\n\n\nA(t) = U [>]    - A(0) < [<] A = {e [i]    - [×][X][×][w] } > A(0) < {< e [−][i][×][w][×][X] } =\n= {e [i][×][X][×][P][ ×][w] } × A(0) × {e [−][i][×][w][×][Q][×][X] } =\n= (I + i × X × P × w + ) × A(0) < ( [<] I − i × w × [<] Q × [<] X + ),\n= (I [>] + i × X × w + ) > A(0) < ( [<] I − i × w × [<] X + ),\n\n\nU [>] = ( [<] U) [†], X [>] = ( [<] X) [†] = < X = X, P    - = P = ( < Q)    - = Q    -,\n\nˆ\nI [>] = P [−][1] = ( [<] I) [†] = (Q [†] ) [−][1], (2 4)\n\n\nwith infinitesimal version in the neighborhood of the genounits characterized by the general\nLie-admissible algebra [loc",

    "REMARKS Note that the generators of the original Lie algebra are not lifted under\ngenotopies, evidently because they represent conventional physical quantities, such as energy,\nlinear momentum, angular momentum, etc Only the operations defined on them are lifted Note also that, when conjugation P = Q [†] is violated, the Lie axioms are lost Note also that\nthe genotheory is highly nonlinear, because the elements P and Q in genotransforms (2 19)\nhave un unrestricted functional dependence, this including that in the local coordinates Nevertheless, genomathematics reconstructs linearity in genospaces over genofields The\n\n\n11\n\n\nsame happens for nonlocality, noncanonicity, nonunitarity and irreversibility [20] In fact,\non genospaces over genofields, genotheories are fully linear, local, canonical unitary and\nreversible Departures from these axiomatic properties occur only in their projection over\nconventional; spaces and fields These are evident fundamental conditions to lift nonlinear,\nnonlocal, noncanonical, nonunitary and irreversible theories into a form compatible with the\nnotoriously linear, local, canonical, unitary and reversible axioms of the special relativity Needless to say, we have been able to present in this note only the rudiments of the needed\ngenomathematics, with the understanding that its detailed study is rather vast indeed Also,\nby no means, genomathematics should be considered as the most general possible form\nadmitted by the Lie axioms Mathematics and physics are disciplines which will never admit\n”final theories” In fact, a still broader multivalued hyperrealization of Lie’s theory has\nalready been identified in Ref [12] and cannot be treated here for brevity ## 3 INVARIANT FORMULATION OF q - DEFORMA- TIONS\n\n\nWe are now equipped to submit the suggested invariant formulation of the (p, q)- [2] or\nq-deformations [2,7,8] First, we have to identify the following insufficiencies:\n\n\n(I) No invariant formulation is possible for (p, q)-parameters because, under the nonunitary time evolution of the theory, brackets (1 2) or ( ) assume the general Lieadmissible form (1 4) (for which reason the latter was submitted in the first place\n\n[5b,6]),\n\n\nU ×(A, B)×U [†] = p×U ×A×B ×U [†] −q×U ×B ×A×U [†] = A′×P ×B′−B′×Q×A′,\n\n\nP = p×(U ×U [†] ) [−][1], Q = q×(U ×u [†] ) [−][1], A′ = U ×A×U [†] B′ = U ×B×U [†] (3 1)\n\n\n(II) Despite such a generality, the formulation are still not physically acceptable because\nthey generally violate the crucial conjugation P = Q [†], without which there is the loss\nof the Lie axioms (Sect 2) with consequential problems in invariance, causality, etc The condition P = Q [†] is therefore assumed hereon (III) Brackets (A, B) = A × P × B − B × Q × A, P = Q [†] on conventional spaces and\nfields are still not invariant and, therefore, they have all problematic aspects (1)-(5)\nof the (p, q)- and q-deformations (Sect 1) In fact, under an additional (necessarily)\nnonunitary transform we have\n\n\nU × (A, B) × U [†] = U × A × P × B × U [†] − U × B × A × U [†] = A′ × P ′ × B′ − B′ × Q′ × A′,\n\n\nP ′ = U [†−][1] ×P ×U [−][1], Q′ = U [†−][1] ×Q×U [−][1], A′ = U ×A×U [†] B′ = U ×B ×U [†] (3 2)\n\n\nThis implies the lack of invariance of the fundamental genounits I [>] = P [−][1] and [<] I = Q [−][1],\nwith consequential ambiguous physical applications 12\n\n\nThe only possible resolution of the above problematic aspects known to this author is the\nformulation of the q-parameter deformations in the operator (P, Q)-deformations formulated\nvia the genomathematics of Sect 2, i e , on bigenofield, bigenospaces, bigenoalgebra, etc In fact, it is easy to see that each structure to the right is invariant under the action of\nthe genogroup to the right, e g , U [>] - I [>] - U [>][†] = I [>], U [>] (A > B) > U [>][†] = A′ > B, the\ninitial genohermiticity to the right can be proved to remain invariant under the action of a\ngenogroup to the right, etc ¿From these grounds, genominkowskian spaces, the genopoincare’ symmetry and the\ngenospecial relativity are expected to coincide at abstract level with the conventional corresponding structures, with the understanding that the detailed study of this expectation will\nbe predictably long and cannot possibly be done in this note We close with a simple rule for the explicit construction of invariant (P, Q)-deformations\nand related genomathematics It is based on the systematic use of two nonunitary transforms\nfor the characterization of motion forward and backward in time,\n\n\nA × A [†] ≠ I, B × B [†] ≠ I, A × B [†] = I [>] = Q [−][1], B × A [†] = < I = (I  - )  - (3 3)\n\n\nIt is then easy to see that the entire genomathematics of the preceding section follows\nvia a simple application of the above two transforms For instance, the genonumbers to\nthe right are given by the above transforms of conventional numbers A× > a × B [†] =\na × (A × B [†] ) = A × I [>], the genoproduct to the right is given by the same transform\nA × (A × B) × B [†] = A′× Q × B′, Q = (A × B [†] ) [−][1] with the correct Hermiticity properties,\n\netc Most importantly, the Lie-Santilli genogroups and genoalgebras can also be derived via\nthe above dual nonunitary map In fact, a conventional, right modular Lie group is lifted\nunder the transform A × B [†] into the forward genoform\n\n\ne [i][×][X][×][w] → A × {e [i][×][X][×][w] } × B [†] =\n= A × (I + i × X × w/1 + (i × X × w) × (i × X × w)/2 + ) × B [†] =\n= I [>] + [>] i [>]   -
