    "# Sonoluminescence as instrument for the measurement of time parameters of fast photomultipliers\n\n##### P # Sonoluminescence as instrument for the measurement of time parameters of fast photomultipliers\n\n##### P V Vorob’ev, I N Nesterenko, A R Frolov, T V V Shaftan Institute of Nuclear Physics, 630090, Novosibirsk\n\n### 1 Abstract\n\nThe apparatus description for control of the time parameters of photomultipliers with high\ntime resolution is described For generation of ultrashort light flashes have been used sonoluminescence effect – emission of the light flashes which is appearing at the stressed interior\nof collapsing air microbubble by sound wave in water For generation of ultrashort light flashes have been used sonoluminescence effect – emission of the light flashes which is appearing at the stressed interior\nof collapsing air microbubble by sound wave in water ### 2 Introduction ### 2 Introduction The modern experiment demands of photoelements with a high time resolution That problems arises at diagnostic of short electron bunch by synhrotron radiation and the high energy\nphysics experiments, where is used often the time of flight methods of measurements For\nthis experiments it is necessary to realize metrological attestation of photoelements Therefore, it is very important to create effective, inexpensive device for generation ultrashort light\npulses This light source have to possess sufficient brightness and wide spectral range For\ngeneration of ultrashort light flashes have been used the sonoluminescence (SL) effect The SL phenomenon was discovered in 1934 [1] and until present time is remaining\nenigmatic one As it turned out, that SL flashes are possessing of unique parameters:\n\n\n−\n\n  - at the each flash emit 10 [5] 10 [6] of photons in spectral range from 150 to 800 nm[2];\n\n\n  - the emission spectrum of the flash fit to one of black body at effective temperature\nabout 50000 [◦] K;\n\n\n  - the flash duration is very small τ ≤ 10 psec[3, 2];\n\n\n  - the dispertion of time interval between flashes is about 100 psec[3];\n\n\n  - size of emission region is less than 3 µm;\n\n\n  - position stable of emission region is better than 3 µm (at measurement by 1000 flashes)\n\n[3] 1\n\n\nThe good review about SL that we know and that we unknow one can be found in\n\n[2] Today amaizing temporal and spectral characteristics of SL phenomena have not of\nsatisfactory explanation Neither the approach of Shwinger [4] and his followers [6, 5], which\nis basing of presentations about quantum vacuum in cavity with moving acceleration wall,\nnor gasdynamics approach are not explaning observation parameters of SL flashes However,\nSL is very simply to observe ### 3 Apparatus for generating of sonolumimescence\n\n\nMany time was noted in [2] the apparatus for observation of SL is simple and inexpensive\n(fig 1) and its can be done in scholl physical laboratory The main part of the apparutus\nis spherical flask with volume about 100 ml This flask is filled up clean deaerated water at\ntemperature near 0 [◦] C The first spherical harmonic frequency of volumetric luquid oscillation is equal:\n\n\nf = [c]\n\nR\n\n\nabout 25 kHz and little bit one is shifted relatively calculated frequency because of influence\nof flask wall The oscillation is excited by four piezoelectric transducers (PZT), which are\nglued at the flask equator The fifth PZT is placed to flask bottom and one is used only for\ncontrol of acoustic resonance For excitation of four PZT is used highly stabilized generator\nand powerful audioamplifier (100 W) The amplifier output is loaded by consecutive oscillating circuit, made up by capacity of the PZT and additional inductance This circuit is tuned\nto the frequency of basic mode of water-filled flask A standing spherical wave in water\nis producing a dynamical trap in the flask center, in which may be captured gas bubble This bubble is produced by microboiler or quick dive in water thin glass stick The bubble\nbehaviour depends on the amplitude of sound wave One can to emphasize four levels of\nexcitation power at which bubble behaviour qualitatively is changed:\n\n\n1) power level is sufficient for bubble keeping into the trap The bubble follow in flask\ncenter However, the bubble life time is limited and one quickly dissolve in deaerated\n\nwater 2) power level, at which the bubble is stable and one exists unrestrictly long time 3) ”dancing bubble”, at this power level bubble performs randomize jumps with amplitude\nabout of millimeter 4) power level, at which ”dance” is ceased and the bubble is stable In this time bubble\nbrightness is changed From begining this power level SL is observed 5) at greate power level bubble is destroyed The bubble existence and one stability is controled by fifth PZT drive signal, which one may\nbe observed as Lissague figure on oscilloscope screen 2\n\n\n### 4 Time measurements\n\nThe measurements time resolution of photomultiplier (PMT) was realized with use of correlative method by Brown-Twiss’s scheme (fig 2) The apparatus includes two photomultipliers,\nwhich are placed at equal distances from the flask center and opposite direction The PMT’s\nsignals have been amplified, formed by discriminators and get to input of time-to-digit converter (TDC) The signal of first PMT get to start for TDC, and the impulse of other PMT\nafter delay line stoped of TDC In this measurements is used broad band amplifiers (with\nband 2 5 GHz) and discriminators with watching threshold The measurement results for pair of photomultipliers NCT-2 is presented on fig 3",
    "3 A\nvalue point of TDC is equal 20 psec (all scale 2000 psec) The dispertion of time intervals\ndistribution is determined of time resolution of this correlometer and one equaled 56 psec The time resolution of each PMT is less in √2 time and equal 40 psec ### 5 Conclusion\n\n\nThe simple and inexpensive equipment, which is allowing to get light flashes with a duration\nabout 10 psec, following with a frequency about 25 kHz have been made In each flashes is\nemitted 10 [5] — 10 [6] photons in spectral range from 200 to 800 nm The emission spectrum\ncorresponds to radiation of black body with temperature about 50000 K The light source\nappears in practical like point (size of emission region less 3 µm) For the measurement of\nPMT time resolution have been used correlational method, i For the measurement of\nPMT time resolution have been used correlational method, i e it is measured the distribution\nof time intervals between photocounts from two PMT The section pathband of registration\nelectronics equal 2 5 GHz and time resolution about 5 psec For exception of the influence\nof the PMT impulse amplitude to measurements results we use fast discriminators with\nwatching threshold [9] The time resolution of PMT with microchannel plate NCT-2 type,\nwhich is developing by INP in collaboration with plant ”Ekran” [8], is 40 psec The dispertion\nof spread time of the electron avalanche, determining of time resolution, was measured and\none amount 40 psec at illumination of all cathode Now we are considering the possibility of measurement of flash duration by other method,\nwhich based on registration of visibility fluctuation of interference image in Michelson’s\ninterferometer",
