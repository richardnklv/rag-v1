    "A simple phenomenological model of EFISH based on the ”interface field approximation”\n\n\n- which assumes linear dependence of the DC-field-induced nonlinear polarization on inter\n\nface DCF strength and yields quadratic dependence of EFISH intensity on bias voltage - was\n\n\ndeveloped for the Si-SiO 2 -electrolyte interface in Refs [25,26] [25,26] Since clear deviations from\n\n\na quadratic bias dependence were observed [33,34], this model was improved by taking into\n\n\naccount the nonlinear interference of DC-field induced and field-independent contributions\n\n\nto the nonlinear quadratic polarization as well as retardation and absorption effects [34] Further improvement resulted from considering the spatial inhomogeneity of the DCF and\n\n\nthe DC-electric-field-induced contribution to the nonlinear polarization [34] These effects\n\n\nwere later analyzed with a Green-function formalism [36,37] At present, the most com\n\nprehensive description of the EFISH phenomenon is presented in Ref At present, the most com\n\nprehensive description of the EFISH phenomenon is presented in Ref [37] However, this\n\n\nanalysis remains incomplete on three points First, it is restricted to the depletion regime of\n\n\nthe SCR, whereas experimentally applied biases have included accumulation and inversion\n\n\nregimes Moreover, as we demonstrate in this paper, the transition from depletion to inver\n\nsion to accumulation drastically changes the EFISH response Second, surface quantization\n\n\neffects originating from strong field localization in inversion and accumulation regimes, as\n\n\n4\n\n\nwell as the role of interface states, should be taken into account Third, multiple reflection\n\n\ninterference in the SiO 2 layer, which significantly affects the SHG intensity from Si-SiO 2\n\n\nstructures [38–40], was neglected In this paper we present a comprehensive phenomenological model of EFISH generation\n\n\nsupported by experimental spectroscopic studies of p- and n-type Si(001)-SiO 2 -Cr MOS\n\n\nstructures The key features of our model are: 1) a detailed electrophysical model of the\n\n\nSCR in the accumulation and inversion regimes, which takes into account interface states\n\n\nand oxide charge traps and their effect on the spatial DCF distribution in the SCR; 2) a\n\n\nrigorous nonlinear optical model of EFISH in the SCR, based on a Green-function formalism,\n\n\nwhich takes into account all retardation effects, absorption of the fundamental and SH\n\n\nradiation, multiple reflection interference of both the fundamental and SH waves in the\n\n\noxide and optical interference between field-dependent and field-independent contributions\n\n\nto the quadratic nonlinear polarization The key feature of our experiments is comprehensive\n\n\nobservation of the dependence of SHG on numerous parameters, including applied bias,\n\n\nazimuthal sample rotation, wavelength near the direct two-photon E 1 transition, doping\n\n\nconcentration, and oxide thickness These combined dependences allow us to deconvolve\n\n\nthe EFISH contribution fully from field-independent contributions The non-quadratic bias\n\n\ndependence of the EFISH intensity predicted in Refs [32,37], and its variation with doping\n\n\nconcentration, oxide thickness, interfacial state density, and wavelength, is observed and\n\n\nanalyzed in detail",

    "C The role of surface quantization effects in the subsurface region\n\n\nThe large gradient of the subsurface ϕ(z) for accumulation and inversion regimes requires\n\n\nthat quantum effects be

consistent\n\n\npotential U(z) is closely related to ϕ(z) Moreover, remote charge layers contribute equally\n\n\nto U(z) and ϕ(z) Nevertheless, the electrostatic and self-consistent potentials are distin\n\nguished by the role of quantum-correlation effects in the electron plasma The electrostatic\n\n\npotential describes interactions of a charged probe particle with other charges only via the\n\n\nelectromagnetic field The self-consistent potential U(z) also includes the electron’s ten\n\ndency to ”wedge” itself into other electrons and repulse them via the exchange interaction,\n\n\nand therefore differs fundamentally from ϕ(z) On the other hand, the EFISH bias depen\n\ndence is expressed in terms of the classical potential ϕ(z), because the major contribution\n\n\nto the semiconductor optical response comes from bound electrons, whereas screening in the\n\n\nsemiconductor is caused by free carriers, and there are no correlation effects between these\n\n\ntwo different types of particles Summarizing this section, we have obtained a set of Eqs (21,23,24) for the self- consistent\n\n\npotential U(z), electron wave function ψ i (r) and charge

a bias-independent constant for a given fun-]\n\n\ndamental wavelength This allows us to neglect the complex value of the latter term and\n\n\nsimulate the bias dependence of I 1 (U) and I 2 (U) by the bias dependence of ReE [BD] and\n\n\n\nImE [BD] in units of ��� F 2ω F ω 2 [χ] [BD] eff This notation is used in the numerical experiment shown in\n���\n\n\n\nFigs 2,4 and 5 Figure 2 shows ReE [BD] and ImE [BD] as functions of the bias applied to the\n\n\nMOS structure, calculated by evaluating the integral in Eq (6) for different dopant concen\n\ntrations of a n-type silicon wafer covered by silicon oxide film 19 nm thick The fundamental\n\n\nradiation wavelength is presumed to be 730 nm Two important trends in these curves are noteworthy First, ImE [BD] depends strongly\n\n\non the bias only in the region of negative biases between 0 V and a saturation bias we\n\n\ndenote as U 0 Outside of this interval the amplitude of the EFISH field saturates This\n\n\nstrongly contradicts the previous phenomenological assumption that the amplitude of the\n\n\nEFISH field depends linearly (and the EFISH intensity quadratically) on the applied bias The saturation of the imaginary part of the EFISH field amplitude for U < U 0 and U > 0 is\n\n\nattributed to the inversion and accumulation regimes of the external bias screening in the\n\n\nSCR (see inset in Fig 1) as the DCF is mostly localized inside a thin subsurface layer of\n\n\nnm-scale thickness Since the imaginary part of the Green’s function is equal to zero exactly\n\n\nat the interface, ImE [BD] becomes practically insensitive to the DCF inside the inversion and\n\n\n13\n\n\naccumulation layers Thus U = U 0 and U = 0 define end-points of a bias region which\n\n\ncorresponds to the depletion regime; the interface potential ϕ 0 for external bias U 0 is equal\n\n\nto 2(ε i − µ), where ε i is the midgap energy [50] Second, decrease of dopant concentration leads to the decrease of the absolute value of U 0\n\n\nand E [BD] Figure 3 shows the dependence of the absolute value of U 0 on the dopant concen\n\ntration of the n-type silicon wafer for various oxide thicknesses For dopant concentrations\n\n\nlarger than 10 [16] cm [−][3], the absolute value of U 0 scales approximately as the square root of\n\n\nN D, while for smaller doping levels |U 0 | scales as ln N D, as is clearly shown in the inset of\n\n\nFig 3 Applied bias U 0 according to Eq (29) consists of voltage drops ǫ sc ǫ [−] d [1] [E] [0] [(][ϕ] [0] [)][D][ across]\n\n\nthe oxide film, and ϕ 0 across the silicon SCR

functions of donor con\n\ncentration, N D Over a wide range of concentrations ReE [BD] and ImE [BD] depend on the\n\n\nsquare root of N D The latter can be explained by integrating Eq (6) with a linear DCF\n\n\nE(z) = E 0 − 2ξz across the SCR, as in the Schottky model This integration yields the\n\n\nfollowing expressions for the EFISH field:\n\n\nReE [BD] ∝ E 0 ∆ 2 + 2ξ [∆] 1 [2] [−] [∆] [2]

0 = 2ξW\n\n\ndepends linearly on the width of the SCR, the restrictions W ∆ 1 >> 1 and W ∆ 2 >> 1 lead to\n\nthe following expression for the complex SH field: E [BD] ∝ E 0 (∆ 2 + i∆ 1 ) ∝ � N D ln(N

are bent less and trap levels begin\n\n\nto fall below the Fermi energy, first the traps with low energy levels, then those with higher\n\n\nenergy Consequently, the bias dependence of ReE [BD] and ImE [BD] for low energy acceptor\n\n\ntraps starts to deviate from the dependence for N A = 0, demonstrating the saturation-like\n\n\nfeature This is attributed to the pinning of the Fermi level As

    "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nA Experimental\n\n\nFor the EFISH experiments the output of an unamplified Ti-Sapphire laser ranging from\n\n\n710 to 800 nm was used The Ti-sapphire laser generates 120-fs pulses with average power\n\n\n16\n\n\nof 200 to 300 mW, which is well below the damage threshold of the semiconductor The\n\n\np-polarized beam was focused onto the sample at a 45 [0] angle of incidence Reflected p\n\npolarized SHG signal was selected by the use of appropriate filters and directed into a\n\n\nphoton-counting system High intensity, high repetition rate, short pulses provided a good\n\n\nsignal-to-noise ratio in our experiments while avoiding significant sample heating A small\n\n\nsplit off portion of the fundamental beam was focussed through a z-cut quartz crystal that\n\n\nprovided a reference SHG signal The MOS structures were fabricated from two types of Si(001) wafers: (I) - a highly\n\ndoped n-type (10 [18] cm [−][3], Sb doped ) wafer covered by a 19 nm thick SiO 2 film, and (II)\n\n\n- a low-doped p-type (1 5 · 10 [15] cm [−][3], B doped) wafer with a 8 7 nm thick SiO 2 film A 3\n\n\nnm semitransparent chromium cap layer, and an ohmic aluminum backside electrode were\n\n\nevaporated onto the samples Single-wavelength ellipsometry was used to measure the SiO 2\n\n\nthicknesses As an independent calibration of the flatband voltage, spatially resolved surface\n\n\nphotovoltage measurements were performed on the same samples The external bias voltage\n\n\nwas applied between the chromium and aluminum electrodes The SHG response from the\n\n\nchromium layer was verified to be negligible in comparison with the SHG signal from the\n\n\nburied Si(001)- SiO 2 interface The bias dependence of the rotational azimuthal anisotropy of the EFISH intensity was\n\n\nmeasured over a wide range of the bias voltages at various fundamental wavelengths from 710\n\n\nnm to 800 nm Figure 6 shows the azimuthal dependence of the EFISH intensity measured\n\n\nfor an n-Si(001) MOS structure The pronounced four-fold symmetric anisotropy of the\n\n\nEFISH intensity superimposed on a significant isotropic (i e independent from the azimuthal\n\n\nangle) background was observed at most biases Variation of the applied voltage changes\n\n\nthe amplitudes of both the four-fold symmetric and isotropic contributions, both of which\n\n\nincrease with increasing the absolute value of the bias At the center of the applied bias region\n\n\nnear -2 75 V (upper panel) azimuthal dependence possesses a significant eight-fold symmetric\n\n\ncomponent, which appears to be comparable with isotropic and four-fold components for the\n\n\nsame bias As the applied voltage passes through this bias the phase of the anisotropy shifts\n\n\n17\n\n\nby π/4 Similar features of the field-induced rotational anisotropy were observed throughout\n\n\nthe studied spectral range Figure 7 shows the azimuthal dependence for a p-MOS structure\n\n\nwhich demonstrates similar behavior, except that the eight-fold symmetric component is\n\n\nobserved at -1 2 V and the isotropic component is appeared to be quite larger than the\n\n\nfour-fold one B",
    "B EFISH at Si(001)-SiO 2 interface: Role of the spatial DCF distribution\n\n\nThe azimuthal angular dependence of the SHG intensity from the Si(001)- SiO 2 interface\n\n\nin the presence of the DCF can be described phenomenologically as optical interference of\n\n\nDC-field dependent, isotropic and DC-field independent, four-fold symmetric components of\n\n\nthe SH field:\n\n\nI 2ω (ψ, V ) = |a(V ) + b cos(4(ψ − ψ 0 ))| [2] =\n\n\n= c 0 (V ) + c 4 (V ) cos(4(ψ − ψ 0 )) + c 8 cos(8(ψ − ψ 0 )), (35)\n\n\nwhere ψ 0 is the azimuthal angle of a maximum of rotational anisotropy, a and b are the\n\n\namplitudes of isotropic and anisotropic components of the SH field The surface, P [S], and\n\n\nthe bulk DCF induced, P [BD], components of the nonlinear polarization, P [NL], contribute\n\n\nto the isotropic component a while the four-fold symmetric component originates from the\n\n\nbulk quadruple polarization, P [BQ] For the sake of simplicity we put the amplitude b of the\n\n\nfour-fold symmetric anisotropic component as a real quantity and define the phase of the\n\n\nisotropic component a = a [′] + ia [′′] with respect to b As a result the dependence of the EFISH\n\n\nintensity on the azimuthal angle, ψ, is given by a Fourier expansion (35) with 0-th, 4-th and\n\n\n8-th Fourier components:\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\n2 [b] [2] [, c] [4] [ = 2][a] [′] [b, c] [8] [ = 1] 2\n\n\n\nc 0 = a [′][2] + a [′′][2] + [1]\n\n\n\n(36)\n2 [b] [2] [ ]\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows the bias dependence of the isotropic Fourier component of the EFISH in\n\n−1\ntensity (left panel) and of the normalized four-fold Fourier component c 4 � 2 [√] 2c 8 � (right\n\n\n18\n\n\npanel), which is exactly the a [′] component of the EFISH field The eight-fold symmetric com\n\nponent, c 8, appears to be field- independent throughout the range of applied biases The\n\n\n−1\nerror bars are the averaged amplitudes of Fourier components c 1 and c 3 2 [√] 2c 8 The\n� �\n\n\ncomponent c 0 (U) is quadratic with a minimum at -3 1 V The a [′] component passes through\n\n\nzero-point also at about -3 1 V and depends on bias nearly linearly with pronounced de\n\nviations from linearity at the edges of the bias range These bias dependences have been\n\n\nfitted within the model described above with the amplitude of the field-independent part of\n\n\na and the flatband voltage U fb as adjustable parameters Figure 8 shows the model results\n\n\nwith U fb = 0 7 V by solid curves which agree well with the experimental data The obtained\n\n\nvalue of the flatband voltage significantly differs from either minimum of c 0 (U) or the bias\n\n\nfor which a [′] = 0 This difference is attributed to the optical interference of the DCF depen\n\ndent (bulk) and DCF independent (surface) contributions to a For this highly doped MOS\n\n\nstructure the entire 8 V range of applied biases of corresponds to the depletion regime Figures 9 and 10 show the bias dependence of c 0 and a [′] for the p-MOS structure The\n\n\nquadratic behavior of c 0 (U) with a minimum at -1 25 V and approximately linear dependence\n\n\nof a [′] (U) with deviations at the limits are similar to the trends of the n-MOS structure The model of the experimental data with dopant concentration of 1 5 · 10 [15] cm [−][3], shows\n\n\na clear step-like feature near the center bias which corresponds to the depletion regime of\n\n\nthe SCR in p-type silicon However, such peculiarity has not been observed experimentally This discrepancy between the model and experiment occurs for the surface-quantization\n\n\ncalculation as well, because at these small biases the surface-quantization effects are not of\n\n\nimportance One possible explanation for the experimentally measured bias dependences is the influ\n\nence of photoinduced effects on the EFISH intensity The absorption of femtosecond laser\n\n\npulses leads to the excitation of electron - hole pairs in the SCR The DCF in the SCR sep\n\narates these photo-induced carriers and the density of the charge injected into SCR for the\n\n\npulse duration τ ∼ 120 fs is on the order of 10 [17] cm [−][3] [6] The presence of these extra charges\n\n\nshould lead to a decrease of the SCR width Systematic theoretical description of this effect\n\n\n19\n\n\nrequires a model that rigorously accounts for the kinetics of electron-hole recombination\n\n\nin the subsurface layer In our model the parameter responsible for the SCR width is the\n\n\ndopant concentration Therefore, photoinduced effects can be effectively taken into account\n\n\nby variation of N D Thick curves in Figures 9 and 10 show the fit with N D = 10 [17] cm [−][3],\n\n\nwhich is two orders of magnitude larger than the actual dopant concentration For such\n\n\na doping level the range of biases which correspond to the depletion regime is sufficiently\n\n\nlarger (about 4 V) and the transition from depletion to inversion and accumulation occurs\n\n\nmore gradually than for a lower doping level Much better agreement of the model with\n\n\nexperimental data is achieved For biases larger then 4 V, which correspond to the strong inversion regime, clear devi\n\nations of the model from experimental data are obtained This is attributed to the strong\n\n\nlocalization of DCF inside a very thin subsurface layer where the bulk description of the\n\n\nDCF screening is hardly expected to be valid and one should take into account surface\n\n\nquantization effects The dashed curve shows the approximation of the data by the model\n\n\nwith quantum corrections, which demonstrates a better agreement with experimental data\n\n\npoints in this bias region",
