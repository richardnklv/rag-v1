    "The detectability of\nseveral consequences of the new scenario is briefly discussed 1\n\n\n1 1\n\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn recent papers [1-5], we pointed out that the apparent Lorentz invariance of the\nlaws of physics does not imply that space-time is indeed minkowskian Lorentz invariance\ncan be just a property of the equations describing a sector of matter above some critical\ndistance scale Then, an absolute rest frame (possibly related to the local rest frame of the\nexpanding Universe) may exist without contradicting the apparent Lorentz invariance felt\nby the particles we are made of We suggested the possible existence of superluminal sectors\nof matter, i e of particles with positive mass and energy but with a critical speed in vacuum\nmuch higher than the speed of light c Sectors of matter with different critical speeds\nin vacuum may coexist, just as in a perfectly transparent crystal it is possible to identify\nat least two critical speeds: those of sound and light Interaction between the ”ordinary”\nsector, i e particles with critical speed in vacuum equal to c, and the superluminal sectors,\nwould break Lorentz invariance But such interactions would be expected to be basically\nvery high-energy, short distance phenomena not incompatible with successful conventional\ntets of Lorentz invariance Several important physical and cosmological implications were\ndiscussed in a scenario with several critical speeds for particles in vacuum Admitting the possible existence of several sectors of matter with different critical\nspeeds in vacuum, some stringent form of grand-unified or primordial constituent background seems necessary in order to explain why so many different particles (quarks, leptons,\ngauge bosons ) have the same critical speed This is in agreement with present ideas in\nparticle theory, and to some extent improves their formulation as it appears that grand\nunification and universality of the critical speed in vacuum may be expressions of a single\nsymmetry inside each sector Our hypothesis extends the current approach, but does not\nreally contradict its basic philosophy However, the superluminal particles we propose are\ndefinitely not space-like states of the ordinary ones: they are a new kind of matter related\nto new degrees of freedom not yet discovered experimentally If superluminal particles\nexist, they may considerably modify the Big Bang scenario, provide most of the cosmic\n(dark) matter, lead the evolution of the Universe, influence low-energy physics and be\nproduced at very high-energy accelerators (e g LHC) or found in experiments devoted to\nhigh-energy cosmic rays (e g AMANDA [6]) where they can yield very specific signatures\nallowing to detect events at extremely small rates (e g [5], but see also Sect 4) In this note, we would like to discuss some possible implications of the new approach for\nour description of space, time and elementary particles As an example, a previously considered SU(2) spinorial space-time [4, 5] will be chosen as the framework If the structure\nof space-time reflects basically the properties of matter at the scales under consideration,\nit should to some extent account for the structure and evolution of the Universe, as well\nas for phenomena like spin 1/2 which cannot be described in a natural way using conventional space-time coordinates In general relativity, the gravitational properties of matter\nmodify the local metric of space-time, but a much closer connection between matter and\nspace-time can be imagined incorporating deeper dynamical properties Also, departure\nfrom the Poincar´e relativity principle yields new fundamental physics (new particles and\ninteractions, motion ”backward in time” in some frames ), as will be discussed later 2\n\n\n2 THE SPINORIAL SPACE-TIME\n\n\nInstead of four real numbers, we take space-time to be described by two complex\nnumbers, the components of a SU(2) spinor From a spinor ξ, it is possible to extract a\nSU(2) scalar, | ξ | [2] = ξ [†] ξ (where the dagger stands for hermitic conjugate), and a vector\n\n⃗\nz = ξ [†] ⃗σξ, where ⃗σ is the vector formed by the Pauli matrices In our previous papers on\nthe subject [4, 5], we proposed to interpret t = | ξ | as the time If the spinor coordinates\nare complex numbers, one has: z = t [2] where z is the modulus of ⃗z It does not seem\npossible to interpret ⃗z as providing the space coordinates: one coordinate, corresponding\nto an overall phase of the spinor, is missed by t and ⃗z Therefore, a different description\nof space seems necessary in this approach Interpreting t as the time has at first sight the drawback of positive-definiteness and\nbreaking of time reversal, but this can be turned into an advantage if t is interpreted\nas an absolute, cosmic time (geometrically expanding Universe) An arrow of time is\nthen naturally set, and space-time geometry incorporates the physical phenomenon of an\nexpanding Universe As space translations and rotations are by definition transformations\nleaving time invariant, the space coordinates should be built by considering the polar\ncoordinates in the hypersphere (i",
    "As space translations and rotations are by definition transformations\nleaving time invariant, the space coordinates should be built by considering the polar\ncoordinates in the hypersphere (i e the spherical hypersurface) of constant time, | ξ | =\nt 0 where t 0 is a value of time [4, 5] On this hypersphere, a point ξ can be decribed as:\n\n\nξ = Uξ 0 (1)\n\n\nwhere U is a SU(2) transformation and ξ 0 a constant spinor (hereafter identified with the\nobserver position) on the sphere t = t 0 Writing:\n\n\n⃗\nU = exp (i/2 t [−] 0 [1] ⃗σ ⃗x) ≡ U(x) (2)\n\n\nthe vector ⃗x, with 0 ≤ x (modulus of ⃗x) ≤ 2πt 0, can be interpreted as the position vector\nat constant time t 0 It is unique, except for a 2π rotation (x = 2πt 0, U = − 1) The\n⃗ ⃗\nnatural metric is dr [2] (x, dx [⃗] ) = (dx [⃗] [∗] ) [2], where dx [∗] is defined by:\n\n\n⃗ ⃗ ⃗\nU(x + dx) = U(dx [⃗] [∗] ) U(x) (3)\n\n\nor, in terms of exponentials:\n\n\n⃗\nexp [i/2 t [−] 0 [1] ⃗σ (x + dx [⃗] )] = exp (i/2 t [−] 0 [1] ⃗σ dx [⃗] [∗] ) exp (i/2 t [−] 0 [1] ⃗σ ⃗x) (4)\n\n\nleading at infinitesimal level to:\n\n\n⃗ ⃗ ⃗\ndx [∗] = dx L + 2t 0 [cos (t [−] 0 [1] [x/][2)][ sin][ (][t] [−] 0 [1] [x/][2)][ x] [−][1] dx ⊥ − sin [2] (t [−] 0 [1] [x/][2)][ x] [−][2] [ ⃗][x][ ∧] [dx][⃗] [] (5)]\n\n\n⃗ ⃗ ⃗ ⃗\n⃗\nwhere dx L = x [−][2] (x dx [⃗] ) ⃗x and dx ⊥ = dx − dx L From (5), we consistently recover\n⃗ ⃗ ⃗ ⃗\ndx [∗] (x = 0) = dx, whereas dx [∗] (x = 2πt 0 ) = dx L Any closed path of the form:\nU(α⃗u) = exp (i/2 αt [−] 0 [1] ⃗σ ⃗u) from α = −2πt 0 to α = 2πt 0, where ⃗u is a unitary\nthree-dimensional real vector, defines a geodesic on the hypersphere and on SU(2) The\nlocal volume element at ξ is d [3] [ ⃗] x [∗] = dx [∗] 1 [dx] [∗] 2 [dx] [∗] 3 [ ]\n\n\n3\n\n\nIt is obvious that, under a SU(2) transformation V, U transforms into V UV [−][1] (the\nvector representation) if ⃗σ ⃗x transforms into V ⃗σ ⃗x V [−][1] (the vector linear representation) The vector ⃗v obtained from the equation V = exp (i/2 ⃗σ ⃗v) defines the rotation axis\nand angle in correspondence with SO(3) rotations ⃗x provides the space coordinates and\ntransforms like a SO(3) real vector, but being a SU(2) parameter it varies on a spherical\nvolume of radius 2πt 0, x ≤ 2πt 0, whose surface is identified to a single point Under the\n\n⃗ ⃗\nrotation defined by V, ⃗x transforms into R V ⃗x = x L + cos v ⃗x ⊥ + v [−][1] sin v ⃗x ∧ v,\n\n⃗ ⃗\nwhere ⃗x L = v [−][2] (x ⃗v) ⃗v and ⃗x ⊥ = ⃗x − x L, as it should be the case for a genuine space\nrotation The observer can thus feel a vector space in a spinorial space-time The cosmic time scale given by the radius of the Universe does not correspond to\nthe local time scale of physical processes at time t, which depends on the local vacuum\ndynamics and varies with cosmic time In situations where the Universe evolves smoothly,\nwe can identify both time scales up to a constant to be determined locally Whatever\nthe relation between the two time scales, the above example (which requires by itself\nunification of space and time) clearly shows that abandoning textbook relativity dogmas\ndoes not necessarily destroy the standard cosmological framework",

necessarily destroy the standard cosmological framework 3 SPACE-TIME SYMMETRIES AND WAVE FUNCTIONS\n\n\nOn a three-dimensional vector representation, a 2π rotation is equal to the identity,\ncontrary to spinor representations of SU(2) where the same transformation changes the\nsign of the spinors The description of particles with half-integer spin in a real space-time\nhas always posed some conceptual problems, in the sense that a spinor wave function\ncannot be built by standard operations from representations of the space rotation group More precisely, a particle with half-integer spin cannot be described by a single-valued\nfunction of the standard space and time variables To circumvent this difficulty, it is said\nthat spinors do not form representations of the basic symmetry group SO(3) of space but\nof the covering group SU(2) of its Lie algebra, or that they belong to representations of\nthe rotation group ”up to a sign” The same situation arises in a relativistic description,\nwhere SL(2, C) is the covering group of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group which, when\ncomplexified, is equivalent to that of SL(2, C) left ⊗ SL(2, C) right (for ”left” and ”right”\nchiral spaces) Our spinorial space-time naturally provides a more compact description:\nposition in the spinor space-time is described by a spinor whereas, simultaneously and\nindependently of whether relativity applies, position in the | ξ | = t 0 hypersphere (the\n”space” at time t = t 0 ) is described by a vector Spinor fields become then single-valued\nfunctions of space-time coordinates It seems worth emphasizing again that, even without\nrelativity, our approach requires and operates a geometric unification of space and time At fixed t 0, the position vector ⃗x describes the relative position of the point ξ with\nrespect to an observer placed at ξ 0 The space coordinates are the parameters of the\n(unique) element U of SU(2) which transforms ξ 0 into ξ Contrary to the conventional\ndescription of space rotations, no SU(2) transformation other than the identity leaves the\nobserver position unchanged, but the observer can measure only the relative position of\nsurrounding objects A 2π rotation would change the signs of ξ 0 and ξ simultaneously 4\n\n\nIt forms with the identity the center of the group and cannot be felt by any position\nmeasurement (the observer is by definition insensitive to its own motion), although the\nproperties of spin-1/2 particles can be checked by other experiments Therefore, in our\napproach, a space rotation around an axis passing through the observer position is a SU(2)\ntransformation whose effects cannot be entirely seen through position measurements If V\nis the SU(2) transformation, all the points in the spinor space of the form ξ = V [λ] ξ 0,\nwhere λ is a real number between −2πv [−][1] and 2πv [−][1], appear unchanged to the observer\nwhen V acts on the spinor space-time However, V actually changes all these points\n(they move along the rotation axis) and preserves only the overall geodesic on the ξ = t 0\nhypersphere Space rotations significantly transform the whole Universe, and can deplace\nthe observer at cosmic scales While space rotations correspond to SU(2) transformations,\nspace translations correspond to a change in the position of the observer on the ξ = t 0\nhypersphere Moving the observer from ξ 0 to ξ 0 [′] [=][ Wξ] [0] [changes the above defined][ U][ into]\nUW [−][1] and, writing W = exp (−i/2 t [−] 0 [1] ⃗σ ⃗w), ⃗σ ⃗x is changed into −2it 0 ln (UW [−][1] ),\nwhere ln stands for neperian logarithm uniquely defined, for U ≠ − W, in the range\nof traceless hermitic 2 × 2 matrices with eigenvalues ±λ such that | λ | < 2πt 0 In\nthe ”local” limit x/t 0 ≪ 1 and w/t 0 ≪ 1, the expression −2it 0 ln (UW [−][1] ) can be\n\n⃗\napproximated by ⃗σ (x + ⃗w) Space translations commute in the infinitesimal limit where\nthe structure of the Lie algebra (providing the cosmic curvature) can be ignored The usual\nparametrization of space transformations is a local one, based on our intuitive, infinitesimal\nview of the tangent hyperplane to the ξ = t 0 hypersphere at the observer position Contrary to space translations, space-time translations defined using spinorial coordinates are real translations which commute but which cannot leave invariant any | ξ | =\nconstant hypersphere We expect them to make sense locally, at scales much smaller than\nthe size of the Universe The generators of such translations are SU(2) spinors, and so\nis the space-time position spinor ∆ξ = ξ − ξ 0 of any point of space-time with respect to\nan observer placed at ξ 0 Supersymmetry could possibly be connected to derivation with\nrespect to the spinorial coordinates, but we shall not discuss this point in the present work Because of the expansion of the space hypersphere, we do not really expect invariance\nunder time translations (energy conservation) to hold at cosmic scale, even if it can be a\ngood local symmetry in the infinitesimal limit ∆t ≪ t where our intuition suggests energy\nconservation to be a basic law of Nature Similar considerations apply to discrete time\nsymmetries, such as T and CPT (no longer protected by a universal Lorentz invariance),\nas the two directions of time are clearly inequivalent at cosmic scale As will be seen later,\nwe expect the cosmological redshift and time dilation to apply as in standard cosmology Up to a n-dependent normalization factor, and taking the above d [3] [ ⃗] x [∗] as the volume\nelement, an example of spinor wave function at time t could be, for integer n ≥ 0 :\n\n\nψ n (ξ) = t [−][3][/][2] (ψ 0 [†] [U ψ] [0] [)] [n] [ ψ] [0] (6)\n\n\nand, for integer n ≤ 0 :\n\n\nψ −n (ξ) = t [−][3][/][2] (ψ 0 [†] [U] [†] [ ψ] [0] [)] [n] [ ψ] [0] (7)\n\n\n5\n\n\nwhere ξ 0 is the observer position at time t, ψ 0 = ψ (ξ 0 ) is the value of the spinor wave\nfunction at ξ 0 and U is the operator uniquely defined by equation (1), tranforming ξ 0\ninto ξ The quantization of n is required by the regularity of the wave function at zero\nvalues of the matrix elements ψ 0 [†] [U ψ] [0] [ In realistic quantum-mechanical situations,][ n][ is]\na very large number in order to make the wave function oscillate at small wavelengths The function defined by the n-th power of the n = 1 wave function ψ 0 [†] [U ψ] [0] [, or by its]\ncomplex conjugate, is then close to a plane wave, as can be seen in what follows From the parametrization (1), we can replace ξ by its space coordinate vector ⃗x and\n\n⃗\nwrite for a spinor wave function ψ = ψ (x, t) Let us the consider the case where ψ 0\nis an eigenspinor of ⃗σ",
    "Let us the consider the case where ψ 0\nis an eigenspinor of ⃗σ ⃗x, and set a coordinate system where ⃗x = (x, 0, 0) Then, if\nσ 1 is taken to be diagonal and σ 1 ψ 0 = ψ 0, one has ψ 0 [†] [U ψ] [0] = exp (it [−][1] x/2) If,\ninstead, ⃗x = (x 1, x 2, x 3 ), and if x 2, x 3 ≪ t, one has ψ 0 [†] [U ψ] 0 ≃ exp (it [−][1] x 1 /2) In both cases, the wave function can be approximated by a plane wave with wave vector\n(t [−][1] /2, 0, 0) Similarly, the n-th power of the matrix element will be a plane wave with\nmomentum (nt [−][1] /2, 0, 0) and can be approximated by exp (i n t [−][1] x 1 /2) as long as\nn (x [2] − x [2] 1 [)] ≪ t [2] The above considered translation W, acting on the spinor wave\nfunctions, will turn U into UW [−][1] It will, to leading order, transform ⃗x into ⃗x + ⃗w and\nthe wave function ψ n ∝ exp (i n t [−][1] x 1 /2) into ψ n [′] [∝] [exp][ [][i n t] [−][1] [ (][x] [1] [ +][ w] [1] [)][/][2] as long]\nas n (w [2] − w 1 [2] [)] ≪ t [2] On an arbitrary spinor wave function ψ n (and similarly for\nψ −n via complex conjugation), of the form (6), the generators of space translations are\nthe matrices in/2 σ j t [−][1] (j = 1, 2, 3) multiplying U at right inside the matrix element\nψ 0 [†] [Uψ] 0 [ Taking][ t][ ≈] [10] [26] [ m][ for cosmic time, the above wave function can be approximated]\nby a plane wave for x [2] ⊥ [=][ x] [2] [ −] [x] [2] 1 ∼ < 10 26 m k L−1 [where][ k] [L] [=][ nt] [−][1] [/][2 is the longitudinal]\nwave vector scale If n ≈ 10 [45] and k L [−][1] ≈ 10 [−][19] m (the lowest distance scale accessible to\n<\nexperiments at TeV energies), the plane wave approximation holds for | x ⊥ | ∼ 1 Km\n(gaussian damping) If n ≈ 10 [61] and k L [−][1] ≈ 10 [−][35] m, the approximation is valid for\n| x ⊥ | ∼ < 10 −5 m Assuming that this transverse damping of quantum wave functions at\nhigh wavelength is to be taken seriously, it is not clear whether feasible experiments can\neventually measure such an effect related to the possible finite radius of the Universe If ψ 0 is an eigenspinor of σ 1 with eigenvalue s (necessarily 1 or -1), and with the\nsame approximations as before, ψ n will be a momentum eigenstate with wave vector [⃗] k of\ncomponents (nst [−][1] /2, 0, 0) It will therefore, with the same approximations, satisfy the\nequation:\n⃗σ [⃗] k | ψ n             - = s k n | n | [−][1] | ψ > = λ k | ψ n             - (8)\n\n\nwhere λ = s n | n | [−][1] is the helicity, with n taking integer values from (6) and (7) 4 EQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\n\nIn the present geometric approach, a natural cosmic time is given by the size of the\nUniverse If radial directions from the point ξ = 0 define the arrow of time and the motion\nof an absolute local rest frame (the ”vacuum rest frame”), it appears from continuity and\nfrom quantization due to the compactness of three-dimensional space, e",

    "4d Causality, spin and statistics\n\n\nIf the number of sectors is finite and all critical speeds are finite, causality is not violated\nbut adapted to the existence of several critical speeds in vacuum It holds explicitly in the\nvacuum rest frame, where no signal can propagate faster than the highest critical speed\nC If the interaction between sectors with different critical speed in vacuum is weak,\nwe expect by continuity the usual spin-statistics connection to hold, as it holds in the\nlimit where different sectors would not interact Then, the standard arguments for the\nspin-statistics connection [9] remain valid with similar assumptions generalized to the new\nsituation As stressed by many authors (e g g [10]), causality is the only known principle\nallowing nowadays to demonstrate the observed relation between spin and statistics Even with the breaking of Lorentz invariances due to interaction between different sectors, the existence of a maximum critical speed in the vacuum rest frame and the causality\ncondition with respect to C in this frame, are enough to enforce the standard connexion\nbetween spin and statistics for all sectors (the ordinary sector and the superluminal ones) For instance, as discussed in [10], if the canonical quantization for bosons is applied to\nfermions, the commutator between a free Dirac fermion field at (t, ⃗x) and its hermitic\nconjugate at (t [′], x [⃗] [′] ) is given by a Dirac operator acting on the integral:\n\n\n⃗\n∆ 1,i (t, ⃗x ; t [′], x [⃗] [′] ) = (2π) [−][3] (2k 0 ) [−][1] d [3] [⃗] k cos[k 0 c i (t − t [′] ) − [⃗] k (x − x [⃗] [′] )] (57)\n�\n\n\n14\n\n\nwhere it can be seen that the function ∆ 1,i (t, ⃗x ; t [′], x [⃗] [′] ) and its derivatives do not vanish\n⃗\nat t = t [′],⃗x ̸= x ′ Therefore, the incompatibility between causality and the ”wrong”\nstatistics remains Similarly, the compatibility between the ”right” statistics and causality\nsurvives if causality is understood as being valid in the vacuum rest frame with respect to\nthe highest critical speed C, as common sense suggests",
    "Similarly, the compatibility between the ”right” statistics and causality\nsurvives if causality is understood as being valid in the vacuum rest frame with respect to\nthe highest critical speed C, as common sense suggests 5 5 SOME EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\nFor obvious reasons, the above analysis (which is far from exhausting the basic theoretical problems) was necessary before considering any possible experimental search for\nsuperluminal particles Experimental implications of the present study will be discussed\nin detail in a forthcoming paper but, from the above discussion, it clearly appears that\nthey are important and that several effects of superluminal sectors may be measurable in\nfuture experiments Contrary to tachyons, which are defined and studied within the original framework of standard relativity [11] considered an absolute property of space-time,\nthe superluminal particles we propose imply by themselves the abandon of this principle (although the space-time felt by our laboratory remains the ”ordinary” minkowskian\nspace-time) The new particles have specific experimental signatures, different from those\nof tachyons [12] However, since they can travel much faster than light, they can indeed\nproduce some ”space-like” phenomena, in astrophysics as well as at accelerators:\n\n\n  - A superluminal particle moving at speed ⃗v with respect to the vacuum rest frame, and\nemitted by an astrophysical object, can reach an observer, moving with laboratory speed⃗\nV with respect to the same frame, at a time (as measured by the observer) previous to the\nemission time Such a phenomenon will happen if ⃗v V [⃗] - c [2], and the emitted particle\nwill be seen to evolve backward in time (but it evolves forward in time in the vacuum rest\nframe) If they interact several times with the detector, superluminal particles can be a\ndirectional probe preceding the detailed observation of astrophysical phenomena, such as\nexplosions releasing simultaneously neutrinos, photons and superluminal particles Directional detection of high-speed superluminal particles in a large underground or underwater\ndetector would allow to trigger a dedicated astrophysical observation in the direction of the\nsky determined by the velocity of the superluminal particle(s) If d is the distance between\nthe observer and the astrophysical object, and ∆t the time delay between the detection of\nthe superluminal particle(s) and that of photons and neutrinos, we have: d ≃ c∆t - Although we expect coupling constants to be small, superluminal particles evolving backward in time can be produced at high-energy accelerators if the energy range\nE ∼ - m i c 2i [is reached for some of such particles Large detectors with high time resolu-]\ntion may in some cases be able to use timing to identify the production of superluminal\nparticles, especially if they are produced by pairs If, as suggested by standard cosmology\nconsiderations, a typical speed for superluminal particles in our laboratory rest frame is\nv ≈ 10 [3] c ≈ 10 [11] ms [−][1], a detector of radius ≈ 10 m with time resolution ≈ 10 [−][9] s (not\nincompatible with the LHC program) would in principle be able to distinguish between\nordinary and superluminal particles, at least in some of the relevant events Larger and\nfaster detectors would be necessary at a later stage in order to measure a high superlumi\n\n15\n\n\nnal speed or to identify a particle evolving backward in time, assuming that it interacts\nsufficiently with the detector (e g through ”Cherenkov” effect in vacuum) A neat experimental distinction can be set between the new superluminal particles and\nthe ”bradyons” and ”tachyons” of ref [12]",
    "[12] Even if some experimental predictions show\nanalogies between our particles and the tachyons, the main properties of the new particles\nare closer to those of bradyons (the ordinary subluminal particles of standard particle\nphysics) The new superluminal particles are actually ”superbradyons”, i e bradyons\nwith a critical speed in vacuum higher than c Like bradyons, they have positive mass as\nwell as positive energy in the laboratory rest frame Contrary to tachyons [13], they can\nemit ”Cherenkov” radiation in vacuum [1 - 5] and, although tachyon theory also hints to\na vacuum rest frame [14], the physical reason is fundamentally different: there is no need\nfor any ”reinterpretation principle” in the case of our superluminal particles The analogy with sine-Gordon solitons (see [1 - 5]) can help to understand the difference\nbetween our ”superbradyons” and the ”tachyons” of previous theories In a galilean spacetime, we can build dynamical systems satisfying equations of dalembertian type (i e with\nan invariance identical to Lorentz invariance, but with a different critical speed related to\nthe properties of the dynamical system) Solitons of such systems, if they form a closed\nself-interacting system, would feel a ”relativistic” space-time with their own critical speed\nplaying the role of the speed of light Such a ”micro-universe” would, in some sense,\nfake our Universe in a finite region of our time Since the dynamical system has a rest\nframe, a ”vacuum rest frame” is automatically set (like in our Universe, if particles are\nsolitons or topological singularities of vacuum, and if vacuum has a natural rest frame set\nby cosmology) ”Lorentz” contraction in the ”micro-universe” is not relative, but absolute,\neven if a serious but isolated observer made of solitons would be led to formulate a relativity\nprinciple and believe erroneously that such a contraction is indeed relative However, the\ndalembertian equation is in general a continuum approximation to a discrete system, or\nthe ”large distance” limit of a more complex dynamics It is not valid below a certain\ndistance scale κ [−][1], where κ is a critical wave vector scale of the system The above ”micro-universe” is not tachyonic, but bradyonic: solitons have always positive mass and energy As long as, even with ”Lorentz” contraction, the longitudinal size of\nthe soliton remains much larger than κ [−][1], ”Lorentz” invariance guarantees that a soliton,\nif stable when at rest in the absolute rest frame (the rest frame of the dynamical system),\nremains stable when it is accelerated to a nonzero speed with respect to the same frame However, if the soliton is accelerated, with respect to the absolute rest frame, to a speed\n<\nsuch that by Lorentz contraction its longitudinal size becomes ∼ κ [−][1], the ”relativity\nprinciple” felt by the soliton micro-universe does no longer apply Then, the previously\nstable soliton can decay into other excitations, like unstable waves, and disperse its energy A similar discussion can be raised for elementary particles such as quarks and leptons, or\ntheir constituents: can we break these particles, just by accelerating them to an inverse\ndistance scale such that relativistic kinematics does no longer hold and the structure of\nvacuum manifests itself at a deeper level The existence of very high-energy cosmic rays\nseems to indicate that such a phenomenon can only happen at energies beyond the reach\nof present and planned accelerators However, the subject deserves attention from a long\n\n16\n\n\nterm point of view, not only for future very high-energy machines but also in the analysis\nof the highest-energy cosmic rays In a sectorial grand-unified theory with spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking, it may happen that the estimated mass of a Higgs or intermediate\nboson be higher than e i c [−] i [2] ≈ h κ i c [−] i [1], where κ i is the value of κ for the sector under\nconsideration and e i is a critical energy scale It is possible that such a boson will never\nbe formed, and similarly for fermions undergoing the same phenomenon The question of whether the constant B (related to some static charge condensed in\nvacuum) vanishes or not, arises already in the ordinary sector It could happen that its existence be hidden by inertial masses (typically, if AD ≫ B [2] ) Therefore, it seems sensible\nto attempt experiments with the so-called ”massless” particles (photon and neutrinos) in\norder to possibly show the effect If B = 0, a sectorial Lorentz invariance is dynamically\ngenerated A possible evidence for B ≠ 0 would be an asymmetry between neutrino\nand antineutrino oscillations The cosmological role of the condensed charge, and of the\n”anomalous” neutrino rest energy, would deserve further investigation It turns out from (18), (23) and (24) that, for a high-speed superluminal cosmic ray with\ncritical speed c i ≫ c, the momentum, as measured in the laboratory, does not provide\ndirectional information on the source, but on the vacuum rest frame Velocity provides\ndirectional information on the source, but can be measured only if the particle interacts\nseveral times with the detector, which is far from guaranteed, or if the superluminal particle\nis associated to a collective phenomenon emitting also photons or neutrinos simultaneously ¿From (18), if in the vacuum rest frame the detected particle has speed v ≃ c i and energy\nE ≃ p c i, the momentum p [⃗] [′] in the laboratory rest frame will be dominated by the term\n− E c [−][2] [ ⃗] V ≃ p c i c [−][2] [ ⃗] V if c i v ≫ c [2], while the velocity v [⃗] [′] is dominated by the term\n\n⃗ ⃗\nv (1 − v V [⃗] c [−][2] ) [−][1], and the particle will be seen (in the laboratory) to evolve backward\nin time if ⃗v V [⃗] - c [2] Again, standard cosmology suggests that the main speed range\nfor cosmic superluminal particles, as measured on earth by a detector made of ordinary\nmatter, should be v ≈ 10 [3] c This would by itself be a signature As more schematically\nemphasized in [5], one has E [′] ≫ p [′] c, which leads to ”back-to-back” events if the\nsuperluminal particle transfers most of its energy to a pair of ordinary particles In this paper, we have assumed that there exists an absolute rest frame of vacuum,\nwhich: a) is the same for all superluminal sectors ; b) provides the local rest frame for the\nexpanding Universe; c) is close to the local rest frame suggested by the study of cosmic\nbackground radiation If superluminal particles are found, it will be possible to directly\ncheck the basic hypothesis of this simple scenario It may happen that the expansion of\nvacuum has followed different evolutions for the degrees of freedom linked to different sectors or, for instance, that the Universe is not really isotropic because of relative rotational\nmodes between these sets of degrees of freedom (this anisotropy could even be spontaneously generated) In such case, it is likely that a single (local) vacuum rest frame would\nnot exist The experimental discovery of particles belonging to different superluminal sectors would then (assuming the speed in the laboratory rest frame to be measurable) allow\nto extract spectra of ⃗v and ⃗p (see Subsection 4b), perhaps not necessarily in the range\nv ≈ 10 [3] c or with a different directional dependence, for each dynamical sector It would\n\n\n17\n\n\nthen, in any case, be possible for the first time to get a direct insight into the inner structure\nof vacuum (evidence for a non-empty vacuum has been provided by particle physics, e g through the discovery of the W [±] and Z [0] ) Ultimately, experiments at very high-energy\naccelerators or an observatory of superluminal cosmic rays may be able to determine the\nvalue of κ i for each superluminal sector by looking at the energy, momentum and velocity\ndistribution of the events However, although the basic phenomenon can perhaps be neatly\nobserved, the dynamical interpretation of the data is likely to be far from trivial References\n\n\n[1] L Gonzalez-Mestres, ”Properties of a possible class of
