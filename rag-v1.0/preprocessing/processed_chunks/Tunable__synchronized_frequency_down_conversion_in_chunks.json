    "However, we can see the motivation for this approach if we look at the experimental\nresults in the modal basis (Fig 3(a)) In this basis, most of the motion occurs in the second\nextended mode and in the localized mode In fact, these modes hold around 90% of the\nsystem’s energy (Fig 3(b)) Therefore, we can restrict our description to these two modes\nwithout incurring a significant error This reduced-order description is: 1 e 1 + T 1 e 1 + a 1 −2ge / S 1 = A h cos 2lm h [ (6)\n\n\nH / e / + T / e / + a / e / −ge 1 = 0 (7)\n\n\n\nIn this description, e 1 and e / are the displacements of the localized and extended modes\nrespectively, A h is the input force, m h is the input frequency, 1, T 1 and a 1 are the effective mass,\ndamping and stiffness of the localized defect mode, /, T / and a / are the effective mass,\ndamping and stiffness of the extended mode The term g = _ QX` c Q/ c X1 c `1 = _ QX` c Q1 c X/ c `1 =\n_ QX` c Q1 c X1 c `/ denotes the quadratic interaction between modes This term can be\ndetermined by performing a Taylor expansion of the interaction force, or by analyzing the\nfrequency response of the local and extended modes (See Supplementary Information) We\nnote that the reduced equations of motion present an asymmetry: There is no term\n\n\nH\n\nproportional to S / in Eq (6) and there is no term proportional to S / S 1 in Eq (7) These terms\n\n\n\nH\n\nproportional to S / in Eq (6) and there is no term proportional to S / S 1 in Eq (7)",
    "(7) These terms\n\ndo not appear in our lattice due to the location of the defect, but they are not generally zero\n(See Supplementary Information for a study on the relation between nonlinear terms and\ndefect location) The interaction between modes can be understood in the following way:\nDue to nonlinearity, the vibration of the defect mode pushes against its neighbors, in a way\nthat is analogous to thermal expansion of a crystal [18] or the optical pressure in an optomechanical system (Fig The interaction between modes can be understood in the following way:\nDue to nonlinearity, the vibration of the defect mode pushes against its neighbors, in a way\nthat is analogous to thermal expansion of a crystal [18] or the optical pressure in an optomechanical system (Fig 3(c)) For small amplitudes, this expansion is proportional to the\n\n\nH\n\nsquare of the vibration amplitude, resulting in the term gS 1 in the extended mode equation H\n\nsquare of the vibration amplitude, resulting in the term gS 1 in the extended mode equation In addition, the motion of the extended mode modulates the distance between the defect\nparticle and its neighbors (Fig 3(d)) 3(d)) This affects the localized mode’s effective stiffness and\nintroduces the parametric term na 1 = gS /, analogous to the modulation of the optical cavity\nwavelength in an opto-mechanical system This type of interaction appears in a variety of\nsystems, such as phonon modes in superconductors [28], and can result in stochastic heat engine\nopearation [29] This reduced-order model can reproduce the experimentally-observed\nbehavior (Figs 3(e) and (f)) with remarkable accuracy We highlight that the only fitting\nparameter used is the excitation amplitude The particle mass, mode quality factor and interparticle force law have all been measured experimentally 6\n\n\n**Figure 3 (Color Online)** _Reduced-order description of the frequency conversion process _ **(a)** Projection\nof the experimental time evolution (Fig 2(a)) in the linear modal basis **(b)** Average energy as a\nfunction of the mode number The system’s energy is highly concentrated in the second extended\nmode and the localized defect mode **(c)** Dynamic expansion of the defect mode When the defect\nvibrates, the nonlinear magnetic interaction results in a non-zero average force acting on the defect’s\nneighbors **(d)** The motion of the second extended mode modulates the distance between the defect\nparticle and its neighbors, dynamically tuning the defect mode frequency **(e)** Detail of the extended\nmode and localized mode evolution, measured experimentally **(f)** Theoretical prediction for the\nextended and localized mode evolution, obtained from a reduced-order model considering only two\nmodes (Eq (6) and (7)) The numerical simulation in panel **f** corresponds to a system with",

    "(7) While being an approximation, this form has\nnumerical advantages by not containing rapidly changing components at the frequency of the\nlocalized mode, and not requiring the evaluation of trigonometric functions for the excitation Besides numerical reasons, the description provided in Eq (8) and Eq (9) is identical to the\nmodel of an opto-mechanical system [30,32,33], for which there is extensive analytical\nliterature [32,34] This analogy provides a lucid interpretation of the frequency converting\nmechanism, whereby the self-sustaining oscillations of the extended more are the result of a\n\nfeedback mechanism between the extended mode’s motion and the localized mode\n\namplitude In this picture, the localized mode amplitude u depends on the extended mode\ndisplacement through the term n e / Equation (9) imposes a retardation between u and e /\nand, as a consequence, the term g u [H] has a quadrature component (shifted 90 degrees from\ne / ([)) that results in negative damping [31] When this negative damping exceeds the value of\nT /, the system develops self-sustaining oscillations, which saturate at a finite value due to\nnon-linearity [31] **Multiple-defect synchronized frequency conversion –** Systems containing multiple defects\ncan present synchronized frequency conversion, where the motion of multiple defects is\ndetermined by the same extended mode, thereby synchronizing the defect’s modulation\nenvelopes and resulting in the conversion of energy from multiple input frequencies to a\nsingle output frequency The use of an extended mode to synchronize multiple resonant\nelements appears in the context of Josephson junction arrays [35], and here we use it to extract\nenergy from multiple sources of mechanical vibrations Our experimental system consists of\n20 magnets, with defect particles in positions 7 (0 244') and 14 (0 197') The initial and final\nparticles are fixed As in the case with a single defect, we set an excitation frequency for each\ndefect equal to the defect’s frequency plus an extended mode’s frequency This time we use\nthe third extended mode instead of the second, because it presents two regions of maximum\nstrain at the two defect’s positons As we did in the single defect case, we increase both\ndefect’s excitation amplitudes simultaneously, until we observe self-sustaining oscillations far\nfrom the defect Figure 4a shows the trajectories of the magnets in the self-sustaining regime We calculate the energy transfer between both defects and the extended mode, by utilizing\nthe empirical force-displacement relation and the defect’s trajectories, and we observe that\nboth defects are contributing energy to the extended mode with a power (c =< AS / >=<\n\nH\n\ngS 1 S / >) of 16",
