    "A Flatness and flatness-based control\n\n\nThe notion of flat system and flatness-based control for\nnonlinear systems have been introduced in [8] Basically, the\n“flatness” is a property of a dynamical system and a choice\nof its output y, as defined here Definition 1 (Flat system - adapted from [8]): A dynamical\nsystem of equations ˙x = f (x) + g(x)u, with x ∈ R [n], u =∈\nR [m] is flat if there exist an R [m] -valued map h, an R [n] -valued\nmap η, and an R [m] -valued map θ such that\n\n\ny = h(x, u, u [(1)], , u [(][ν][)] ) (12)\n\n\nx = η(y, y [(1)], , y [(][ν][−][1)] ) (13)\n\n\nu = θ(y, y [(1)], , y [(][ν][)] ) (14)\n\n\nfor an appropriate value of ν ∈ N The output y is then called\n“flat output” The idea of flatness can be explained briefly as follows If one can choose as many output variables y i as inputs\n(the system is square), such that it is possible to recover\nthe state and the inputs from the derivatives of these output\nvariables, then the system is flat and a flatness-based, open\nloop control law can be derived by system inversion (as\nexplained later on) Two fundamental concepts for system\ninversion are characteristic index and coupling matrix Definition 2 (Characteristic index): The characteristic index\nof the i-th component y i of y is the smallest ρ i ∈ N for which\nL g j L [ρ] f [i] [−][1] h i ̸= 0 for at least one value of j Definition 3 (Coupling matrix): The coupling matrix ∆(x)\nis given by the expression:\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nIt is possible to prove that with this state trajectory, the\nsystem’s dynamic of each y i is linear

    "VI E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\n\nIn order to assess the performance of the proposed control\napproach, an experiment has been conducted on the platform The proposed flatness-based control coupled with PI has been\ncompared to a PI controller, empirically tuned to get the\nbest apparent performances The same reference trajectory (a\ncombination of sinusoids) has been tested for both controllers Figure 9 reports the results for the PI controller, whereas\nFigure 10 shows the flatness-based controller results It is\n\n\n\nwhere y i is the desired trajectory and w is an additional control\nterm Due to the presence of the perturbation terms which\nhave been neglected (Γ), if w = 0 there will necessarily be\na non-zero error ǫ i = y i − y i Considering that the dynamic\nof the system under this law is just a chain of integrators, by\nimposing to w a feedback law as a function of the ǫ i closes\nthe loop In this case, a proportional-integral controller (PI)\nhas been tuned Figure 7 shows the overall control scheme The flatness-based control is for some aspects, quite similar\nto feedback linearisation control [9] The main differences lie\nin the fact that flatness-based requires a specific choice of flat\noutput (whereas feedback linearisation can take any output,\nassuming the system is observable), and that it does not require\na knowledge or measure of the state variable On the other\nhand, the baseline flatness-based control is feedforward only,\nwhich requires the introduction of the additional feedback term\n\nw V",
    "V S OLVING THE OVERACTUATION\n\n\nIt can be pointed out that the platform is overactuated,\nin the sense that the three forces applied by the muscles\nare generating only two torques To tell it in another way,\nthe average value of the F i is irrelevant for the platform’s\ncertain torques, thendynamic; if a given F F 1 = 1 =F [˜] 1, FF˜ 12 + = FF [˜] 02 and, F 2 = F 3 = F˜ 2 F [˜] + 3 generate F 0 and\nF 3 = F [˜] 3 + F 0 will generate the same torques for any F 0 On the other hand, it is useful to have three muscles instead\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n450\n\n\n300\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF min\n\n\n0\n\n0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25\n\n\nContraction (ǫ i )\n\n\nFig 8 For a given position, the three contractions ε i are given, so not all\nforces are possible for each muscle, but only those within the pressure range\nbetween 1 25 and 7 bar One can compute F max (the maximum force that\nall muscles can exert) and F max (the minimum force that all muscles can\nexert) Setting F 3 as the average between these two allows all muscles to\napply the desired forces and to maximise their range apparent from the picture that the feedforward action added by\nthe flatness-based control greatly improves the tracking ability;\nin fact, it can be computed that the root mean square tracking\nerrors (for θ x and θ y respectively) are 0 51 and 0 59 degrees\nfor the PI case With the flatness controller, these root mean\nsquare errors become less than half, i",
