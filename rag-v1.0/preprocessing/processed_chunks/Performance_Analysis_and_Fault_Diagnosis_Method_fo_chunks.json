mounted on a dual axis tracker by Green Source Technology The acceptance angle of the CPV receiver is ±0 92 degree and\nrecommended tracking accuracy is ±0 7 degree while the\ntracker accuracy is less than ±0 2 degree A cell efficiency of\n38 5% was achieved at Standard Test Condition (STC) and\nmodule efficiencies of 28% and 26% with fill-factors 83 4%\n\nand 82 8% were achieved at STC and Standard Operating\nCondition (SOC), respectively [15,16] The CPV receiver has\na glass homogenizer that reduce the possibility of chromatic\naberration The band gap combination of the 3-junction cell at\n298 Kelvin is 1 89 eV, 1 42 eV and 0 66 eV [8] A schematic\nof the CPV receiver is shown in figure 1 A schematic\nof the CPV receiver is shown in figure 1 Fig 1 1 Schematic of the CPV receiver\n\nDNI was measured using a Kipp & Zonen CHP1\npyroheliometer and cell temperatures were sensed using\nPT100 temperature sensors embedded in the module under\neach solar cell The temperature sensors do not influence the\nperformance of the cells [17] The IV curves were measured\nevery ~20 seconds A weather monitoring system Vintage Pro\n2 supplied by Davis Instruments that measures the ambient\ntemperature, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and\natmospheric pressure was also used Figure 2 shows the DNI profiles for 7 [th] January 2014, 20 [th] April\n2014 and 18 [th] November 2014 7 [th] January 2014 was a clear\nday with no cloudiness and a peak DNI of around 950 W/m [2] is\nrecorded at around 11AM January is winter in Bangalore and\nis a time of year when India has little cloud cover and receives\nhigh DNI; in contrast to Spain and South Africa where high\nDNIs are received in summers [18] April is pre-monsoon and\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nNovember is post monsoon During the months of April and\nNovember, we see intermittent cloudiness, especially during\nafternoon and evening Fig 2 DNI profile on 7 [th] January 2014, 20 [th] April 2014 and 18 [th] November\n\n2014\n\nThe thermal behaviour of the module was verified using PT100\nsensors located in a matrix across the module The module is\n\nfound to heat up quickly but cool down slowly Figure 3a\nshows the temperature of channels 7, 10 and 12 in the module\non 7 [th] January 2014 The temperatures and corresponding\nvalues of open circuit voltage (V oc ) of individual cells at 11\nAM on 7 [th] January is shown in figure 3b The individual cell\ntemperatures within the module are important as the cell\ntemperature is inversely proportional to V oc and the module V oc\nis the sum of individual cell V oc values The value of V oc for\nindividual cells are obtained using a computer model that has\nbeen optimised for the cells in our module (discussed later in\nsection 4) We learn that the cell temperatures are higher at the\nmodule centre and lower at the module edges This is\nconsistent with the study conducted by Ota et al [19] and\nCastro et al [20] The cell temperatures were further correlated\nwith the wind speed and it is concluded that the temperature\nvariation is small for the wind speed at the test location and\nwind speed did not have a huge impact on performance IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, © IEEE\n\n\nFig 3 (a) Cell temperatures within module on 7 [th] January 2014 and (b)\n\ninstantaneous cell temperatures and open-circuit voltages at 11 AM, 7

sub-cell photocurrents heavily depend\non it and also to decouple the effect of spectral difference from\nactual CPV performance While the spectrum is seldom\nmeasured, the meteorological parameters such as Aerosol\nOptical Depth (AOD) and precipitable water (PW) are available\n(from AERONET or other ground-based measurements) Hence, we can simulate the CPV system by modelling the\nspectrum using AOD and PW as prominent parameters with a\nradiative transfer model, as described in this work Importantly,\nAOD and PW were not available for the site for spectrum\nmodelling and the measured spectrum had spectral irradiance\nmeasurements only up to 1050 nm Hence a methodology was\ndeveloped using two irradiance models (SMARTS2 [21] &\nSPCTRAL2 [22]) to estimate these from the measured\nspectrum and DNI data The PW was estimated by fitting the\nmeasured and calculated spectrum in the regions where water\nabsorption leads to dips in the solar spectrum, notably at 930\nnm with SPCTRAL2 model and is used as an input to\nSMARTS2 to model the entire spectrum The Shettle and Fenn\n(S&F) urban aerosol model in SMARTS2, which considers the\neffect of relative humidity on aerosols, was chosen to best\nmatch the short wavelength response and the AOD is adjusted\nso that the integrated spectral irradiance matched the measured\nDNI A few clear days were picked from the month of January 2014\nand the spectrum was fitted using SPCTRAL2 and SMARTS2 The value of PW and AOD were noted from the fitted spectrum Table 1 presents the parameters used for fitting the spectrum\nand table 2 shows the calculated and measured parameters from\nfitted spectrum for 7 [th] of January 2014 which was a clear day\nand variation in AOD over the day was not much The\nprominent parameter that effects the performance of a CPV\nsystem during such a day is airmass Figure 4 illustrates the\neffects of AOD and PW on the spectrum We can clearly see\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nthat the shorter wavelengths of the spectrum are mainly\ndetermined by the AOD, while PW leads to absorption features\nin the near-infrared TABLE I\n\nP RINCIPLE PARAMETERS USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF\n\n\nSPECTRAL
