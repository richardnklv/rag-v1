    "## Data-Driven Participation Factors for Nonlinear Systems Based on Koopman Mode Decomposition\n\nMarcos Netto, _Student Member, IEEE,_ Yoshihiko Susuki, _Member, IEEE,_ and Lamine Mili, _Life Fellow, IEEE_\n\n\n\n_**Abstract**_ **—This paper develops a novel data-driven technique**\n**to compute the participation factors for nonlinear systems based**\n**on the Koopman mode decomposition Provided that certain**\n**conditions are satisfied, it is shown that the proposed technique**\n**generalizes the original definition of the linear mode-in-state**\n**participation factors Two numerical examples are provided to**\n**demonstrate the performance of our approach: one relying on**\n**a canonical nonlinear dynamical system, and the other based**\n**on the two-area four-machine power system The Koopman**\n**mode decomposition is capable of coping with a large class of**\n**nonlinearity, thereby making our technique able to deal with**\n**oscillations arising in practice due to nonlinearities while being**\n**fast to compute and compatible with real-time applications **\n\n\n_**Index Terms**_ **—Koopman mode decomposition, modal analysis,**\n**modal participation factors, nonlinear systems, stability **\n\n\nI INTRODUCTION\n# T HE participation factors are an important component ofthe so-called selective modal analysis proposed by P´erez\nArriaga _et al _ [1] _ [1] They are widely used in the power industry\nas they provide a measure of the relative contribution of modes\nto system states and vice versa Applications include stability\nanalysis [2], dynamic model reduction [3], and placement\nof power system stabilizers [4] Alternative [5] and complementary [6] perspectives to the original definition of linear\nparticipation factors have also been proposed in the literature For instance, Hashlamoun _et al For instance, Hashlamoun _et al _ [5] advocate that the initial\nstates are uncertain, thereby casting the problem of computing\nthe participation factors as a stochastic one, as opposed to a\ndeterministic one; then, by relying on the definition of the\nmathematical expectation and by assuming that the initial\nstates follow a uniform probability distribution, a dichotomy\nbetween mode-in-state and state-in-mode participation factors\nis suggested Despite the existence of different views, the\nparticipation factors are a well-accepted metric of the dynamic\nperformance of linear systems; therefore, its extension to nonlinear models is of practical interest since it is known that the\nanalysis of power systems through model linearization does\nnot provide an accurate picture of the modal characteristics\nwhen the system is operating under stressed conditions [7] An attempt to go beyond the linear paradigm was made by\nLesieutre _et al _ [8] by applying a transformation from state\nvariables to harmonic variables to gain insight on the statein-mode participation factors at the Hopf bifurcation point Although interesting, their approach ultimately computed the\nparticipation factors of a transformed linear model associated\nwith the stable limit cycle A different approach was taken\nby Vittal _et al _ [7], with the intent of studying inter-area\n\n\nThis work was supported by CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of\nBrazil, under grant BEX13594/13-3, and by the JSPS KAKENHI #15H03964 M Netto and L Mili are with the Bradley Department of Electrical and\nComputer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,\nVA 22043 USA (e-mail: _{_ mnetto, lmili _}_ @vt edu) Y Susuki is with the Department of Electrical and Information Systems,\nOsaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan (e-mail: susuki@ieee org)",
    "org) modes of oscillation in stressed power systems following\nlarge disturbances, when nonlinearities play an important role The idea in [7] is to compute the participation factors by\nconsidering up to the second-order terms in the Taylor series\nexpansion of the nonlinear model and then applying the\nmethod of normal forms The inclusion of third-order terms\nhas also been exploited in [9] Due to the importance of this\nline of research, the shortcomings of the method of normal\nforms have been investigated in [10] Firstly, this method\nsuffers from a heavy computational burden that will make it\ninapplicable to large-scale systems even if second-order terms\nare considered only Secondly, it involves a highly nonlinear\nnumerical problem that needs to be solved to retrieve the\ninitial conditions In an attempt to overcome these weaknesses,\nPariz _et al _ [11] proposed the modal series method, which\nhas the advantages of being valid under resonance conditions\nand not requiring nonlinear transformations However, their\napproach is also restricted to polynomial nonlinearities, as is\nthe case with the method of normal forms Furthermore, the\naforementioned approaches do not consider the state-in-mode\nparticipation factors, which are accounted for in this paper In face of the exposed challenges, it has been suggested\nin [10] and in [12] that the computation of the participation\nfactors from measurements could either provide a solution\nto the aforementioned issues directly, or be complementary\nto model-based techniques such as the ones that rely on the\nTaylor series expansion of the power systems nonlinear model The problem thus becomes one of estimating linear and _nonlin-_\n_ear_ participation factors from the measurements In this paper,\nthis problem is addressed via the Koopman operator-theoretic\nframework [13] Recently, following the work of Mezi´c _et al _\n\n[14], [15] and of Rowley _et al",
    "_\n\n[14], [15] and of Rowley _et al _ [16], this framework based on\nthe point spectrum of the Koopman operator, and henceforth\nreferred to as the Koopman mode decomposition (KMD), has\ngained momentum as a powerful data-driven tool to analyze\nnonlinear dynamical systems Our solution of data-driven\nparticipation factor is also based on the spectral properties\nof the Koopman operator, precisely the point spectrum and\nassociated eigenfunctions, and the so-called Koopman modes\n\n[16] To approximate the spectral objects, we resort to the\nextended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) [17], [18] Then, we demonstrate how to compute linear and nonlinear\nparticipation factors from the measurements To the authors’\nbest of knowledge, this is the first comprehensive application\nof the EDMD algorithm in power systems Sako _et al _ [19],\nand Netto and Mili [20], [21] adopt the EDMD but did not consider nonlinear observables, which conversely are accounted\nfor in the present work, thereby exploring the full potential\nof the KMD The computation of the participation factors\nwith the proposed technique is not restricted by the form of\nthe underlying dynamical system Furthermore, provided that\ncertain conditions are satisfied, it is shown that our approach\n\n\ngeneralizes the one proposed by P´erez-Arriaga _et al _ [1] to\nnonlinear dynamical systems, in the case of mode-in-state\nparticipation factors The paper proceeds as follows Section II briefly revisits\nthe formulation of the linear participation factors Section\nIII introduces the proposed data-driven technique to compute\nlinear and nonlinear participation factors based on the KMD Section IV discusses some numerical results Conclusions and\nongoing work are provided in Section V II PRELIMINARIES\n\nConsider a continuous-time autonomous nonlinear system\ndefined on an _n_ -dimensional Euclidean space R _[n]_ as follows:\n\n\n˙\n_**x**_ = _**f**_ ( _**x**_ ) _,_ (1)\n\n\nwhere _**x**_ _∈_ R _[n]_ is the system state vector, and _**f**_ : R _[n]_ _→_ R _[n]_ is\na vector-valued nonlinear function By performing a Taylor\nseries expansion of (1) around a stable equilibrium point\n(SEP), and considering only the first-order term, we have\n\n\n˙\n_**x**_ = _**Ax**_ _,_ (2)\n\n\nwhere _**A**_ _∈_ R _[n][×][n]_ is a Jacobian matrix, i e , _**A**_ := _∇_ _**f**_ ( _**x**_ ) =\n_∂_ _**f**_ ( _**x**_ )\n\n_∂_ _**x**_ _[⊤]_ [, and] _**[ x]**_ _[⊤]_ [denotes the transpose of] _**[ x]**_ [ By assuming that]\nall the eigenvalues _λ_ _i_, _i_ = 1 _, , n_, of _**A**_ are distinct, the\neigendecomposition of _**A**_ is given by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas the contribution factors provide valuable information\nabout the contribution of a mode to the dynamics of a state,\na measure of the system performance that depends only\non the characteristics of (2), and not on the system initial\ncondition, _**x**_ 0, is advantageous for capturing inherent system\ncharacteristics _A Participation factors as originally proposed in [1]_\n\nNow we introduce the original notion of participation factors\nbased on [1] _Definition 2:_ The _mode-in-state participation factors_ of the\nlinear system (2) are defined as\n\n\n_p_ _ij_ := _v_ _ij_ _u_ _ij_ _ _ (8)\n\n\nThey provide a _relative_ measure of the magnitude of the modal\noscillations in a state when only that state is perturbed initially To derive (8), one makes use of (7) and selects _**x**_ 0 = _**e**_ _i_,\nwhere _**e**_ _i_ is the unit vector along the _i_ -th coordinate axis _Definition 3:_ The _state-in-mode participation factors_ of the\nlinear system (2) are defined as\n\n\n_p_ _ij_ := _v_ _ij_ _u_ _ij_ _ _ (9)\n\n\nThey measure the _relative_ participation of the _j_ -th state in the\n_i_ -th mode To derive (9), one substitutes (4) into (2) and finds ˙ _**z**_ = **Λ** _**z**_,\nyielding to _z_ _i_ ( _t_ ) = _z_ _i_ 0 _e_ _[λ]_ _[i]_ _[t]_ = _**v**_ _i_ _[⊤]_ _**[x]**_ [0] _[e]_ _[λ]_ _[i]_ _[t]_ [ Then, by selecting]\n\n_n_\n_**x**_ 0 = _**u**_ _i_, _z_ _i_ ( _t_ ) = �� _j_ =1 _[v]_ _[ij]_ _[u]_ _[ij]_ � _e_ _[λ]_ _[i]_ _[t]_ Notice that as proposed\nin [1], (8) and (9) have the same expression _B Alternative definition of the participation factors [5]_\n\nAs shown above, P´erez-Arriaga _et al _ [1] put _**x**_ 0 = _**e**_ _i_ in\n(7) to define the mode-in-state participation factors",

around which (1) is\nlinearized, as well as the location and duration of a given\ndisturbance [22] The nonlinear counterpart of (7) based on the\nKMD was pinpointed by Susuki and Mezi´c in [23],
