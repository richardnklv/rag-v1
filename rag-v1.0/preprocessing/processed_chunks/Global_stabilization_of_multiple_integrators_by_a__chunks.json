    "### **Global stabilization of multiple integrators by a bounded** **feedback with constraints on its successive derivatives**\n\nJonathan Laporte, Antoine Chaillet and Yacine Chitour [∗][†]\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nIn this paper, we address the global stabilization of chains of integrators\nby means of a bounded static feedback law whose _p_ first time derivatives are\nbounded Our construction is based on the technique of nested saturations\nintroduced by Teel We show that the control amplitude and the maximum\nvalue of its _p_ first derivatives can be imposed below any prescribed values Our results are illustrated by the stabilization of the third order integrator on\nthe feedback and its first two derivatives ### **1 Introduction**\n\n\nActuator constraints is an important practical issue in control applications since it\nis a possible source of instability or performance degradation Global stabilization\nof linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with actuator saturations (or bounded inputs)\ncan be achieved if and only the uncontrolled linear system has no eigenvalues with\npositive real part and is stabilizable [1] Among those systems, chains of integrators have received specific attention Saturation of a linear feedback is not globally stabilizing as soon as the integrator\nchain is of dimension greater than or equal to three [2, 3] In [4] a globally stabilizing feedback is constructed using _nested saturations_ for the multiple integrator This construction has been extended to the general case in [1], in which a family of stabilizing feedback laws is proposed as a linear combination of saturation\nfunctions In [5] and [6], the issue of performance of these bounded feedbacks is\ninvestigated for multiple integrators and some improvements are achieved by using variable levels of saturation A gain scheduled feedback was proposed in [7] to\nensure robustness to some classes of bounded disturbances Global practical stabilization has been achieved in [8] in the presence of bounded actuator disturbances\nusing a backstepping procedure",

rate\nsaturation [9] and corresponds to the situation when the signal delivered by the actuator cannot have too fast variations This issue has been addressed for instance in\n\n[10]-[11] In [10, 12], regional stability is ensured through LMI-based conditions In [9], a gain scheduling technique is used to ensure semi-global stabilization of integrator chains In [13], semi-global stabilization is obtained via low-gain feedback\nor low-and-high-gain feedback In [11], a backstepping procedure is proposed to\nglobally stabilize a nonlinear system with a control law whose amplitude and first\nderivative are bounded independently of the initial state In this paper, we deepen the investigations on global stabilization of LTI systems subject to bounded actuation with rate constraints We consider rate constraints that affect only the first derivative of the control signal, but also its successive _p_ first derivatives, where _p_ denotes an arbitrary positive integer Focusing on\nchains of integrators of arbitrary dimension, we propose a static feedback law that\nglobally stabilizes chains of integrators, and whose magnitude and _p_ first derivatives are below arbitrarily prescribed values at all times Our control law is based\non the nested saturations introduced in [4] We rely on specific saturation functions,\nwhich are linear in a neighborhood of the origin and constant for large values of\ntheir argument This paper is organized as follows In Section 2, we provide definitions and\nstate our main result The proof of the main result is given in Section 3 based\non several technical lemmas In Section 4, we test the efficiency of the proposed\ncontrol law via numerical simulations on the third order integrator, with a feedback\nwhose magnitude and two first derivatives are bounded by prescribed values We\nprovide some conclusions and possible future extensions in Section 5 **Notations ** The function sign : R\\{0} → R is defined as sign( _r_ ) := _r_ / | _r_ | Given a set _I_ ⊂ R and a constant _a_ ∈ R, we let _I_ ≥ _a_ := { _x_ ∈ _I_ : _x_ ≥ _a_ } Given\n_k_ ∈ N and _m_ ∈ N ≥1, we say that a function _f_ : R _[m]_ → R is of class _C_ _[k]_ (R _[m]_, R) if its\ndifferentials up to order _k_ exist and are continuous, and we use _f_ [(] _[k]_ [)] to denote the\n_k_ -th order derivative of _f_ By convention, _f_ [(][0][)] := _f_ The factorial of _k_ is denoted\nby _k_ We define � _m_, _k_ � := { _n_ ∈ N : _n_ ∈ [ _m_, _k_ ]} We use R _[m]_ [,] _[m]_ to denote the set of\n_m_ × _m_ matrices with real coefficients _J_ _m_ ∈ R _[m]_ [,] _[m]_ denotes the _m_ -th Jordan block,\ni e the _m_ × _m_ matrix given by ( _J_ _m_ ) _i_, _j_ = 1 if _i_ = _j_ − 1 and zero otherwise For\neach _i_ ∈ �1, _m_ �, _e_ _i_ ∈ R _[m]_ refers to the column

integrators with a control law whose magnitude and _p_ first derivatives are bounded by\nprescribed constants Given _n_ ∈ N ≥1, the multiple integrator of length _n_ is given\n\n\n2\n\n\nby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_x_ ˙ 1 = _x_ 2, _x_ ˙ _n_ −1 = _x_ _n_,\n\n_x_ ˙ _n_ = _u_ (1)\n\n\n\nLetting _x_ := ( _x_ 1, , _x_ _n_ ), System (1) can be compactly written as\n\n\n_x_ ˙ = _J_ _n_ _x_ + _e_ _n_ _u_ In order to make the objectives of this paper more precise, we start by introducing\nthe notion of _p_ -bounded feedback law by ( _R_ _j_ ) 0≤ _j_ ≤ _p_ for System (1), which will be\nused all along the document **Definition 1 ** _Given n_ ∈ N ≥1 _and p_ ∈ N _, let_ ( _R_ _j_ ) 0≤ _j_ ≤ _p_ _denote a family of positive_\n_constants We say that_ ν : R _[n]_ → R _is a p-bounded feedback law by_ ( _R_ _j_ ) 0≤ _j_ ≤ _p_ _for_\n_System (1) if, for every trajectory of the closed loop system_ ˙ _x_ = _J_ _n_ _x_ + _e_ _n_ ν ( _x_ ) _, the_\n_time function u_ : R ≥0 → R _defined by u_ ( _t_ ) = ν ( _x_ ( _t_ )) _for all t_ ≥ 0 _satisfies, for all_\n_j_ ∈ �1, _p_ � _,_\nsup _u_ ( _j_ ) ( _t_ ) ≤ _R_ _j_ _t_ ≥0 ���� ����\n\n\nBased on this definition, we can restate our stabilization problem as follows Given _p_ ∈ N and a set of positive real numbers ( _R_ _j_ ) 0≤ _j_ ≤ _p_, our aim is to design\na feedback law ν which is a _p_ -bounded feedback law by ( _R_ _j_ ) 0≤ _j_ ≤ _p_ for System\n(1) such that the origin of the closed-loop system ˙ _x_ = _J_ _n_ _x_ + _e_ _n_ ν ( _x_ ) is globally\nasymptotically stable The case _p_ = 0 corresponds to global stabilization with\nbounded state feedback and has been addressed in e g [4, 5, 6]",
    "[4, 5, 6] The case _p_ = 1\ncorresponds to global stabilization with bounded state feedback and limited rate,\nin the line of e g [10, 12, 9, 13, 11] Inspired by [4], our design for an arbitrary\norder _p_ is based on a nested saturations feedback, where saturations belong to the\nfollowing class of functions **Definition 2 ** _Given p_ ∈ N _,_ S ( _p_ ) _is defined as the set of all functions_ σ _of class_\n_C_ _[p]_ (R, R) _, which are odd, and such that there exists positive constants_ α _, L,_ σ _[max]_\n\n_and S satisfying, for all r_ ∈ R _,_\n\n\n_(i) r_ σ ( _r_ ) > 0 _,

4-tuple ( σ _[max]_, _L_, _S_, α ) _ _\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe constants σ _[max]_, _L_, α, and _S_ will be extensively used throughout the paper Figure 1 helps fixing the ideas Figure 1 helps fixing the ideas σ _[max]_ represents the saturation level, meaning the\nmaximum value that can be reached by the saturation _L_ denotes the linearity\nthreshold: for all | _r_ | ≤ _L_, the saturation behaves like a purely linear gain α is\nthe value of this gain that is, the slope of the saturation in the linear region _S_\nrepresents the saturation threshold: for all | _r_ | ≥ _S_, the function saturates and takes\na single value (either − σ _[max]_ or σ _[max]_ ) Notice that it necessarily holds that _S_ ≥ _L_\nand the equality may only hold when _p_ = 0 We also stress that the successive\nderivatives up to order _p_ of an element of S ( _p_ ) are bounded An example of such\nfunction is given in Section 4 for _p_ = 2 Figure 1: A typical example of a S ( _p_ ) saturation

following alternatives : either for every _t_ ≥ 0,\n| _y_ _n_ ( _t_ )| ≤ _L_ µ _n_ /2 and we are done, or there exist _T_ 0 ≥ 0 such that | _y_ _n_ ( _T_ 0 )| > _L_ µ _n_ /2 10\n\n\nIn that case there exists _T_ [˜] 0 ≥ _T_ 0 such that _y_ _n_ ( _T_ [˜] 0 ) = _L_ µ _n_ /2 (otherwise thanks to\n(30), _V_ _n_ ( _t_ ) →− ∞ as _t_ → ∞ which is impossible) Due to (30), we have | _y_ _n_ ( _t_ )| <\n_L_ µ _n_ /2 in a right open neighbourhood of _T_ [˜] 0 Suppose that there exists a positive\ntime ˜ _T_ [˜] 1 - _T_ [˜] 0 such that �� _y_ _n_ ( _T_ ˜ 1 )�� ≥ _L_ µ _n_ /2 Then by continuity, there must
