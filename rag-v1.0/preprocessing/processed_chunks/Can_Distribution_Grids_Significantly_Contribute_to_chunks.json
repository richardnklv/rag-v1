    "** **INTRODUCTION**\n\n\nThe increasing share of renewable energies (RE) in\nGermany shifts the paradigm of electricity generation\nfrom large, centralized power production to so-called distributed generation where producers are mainly installed\nin the distribution grid (see Fig 1) 1) As the placement\nof RE generators like wind and solar power plants takes\nplace according to their optimal yield instead of vicinity\nto power consumers, the distances of power transmission\nincreases Altogether, this results in a more stress for the\npower infrastructure, and thus the demand for reactive\npower increases at all grid levels At the same time REs\noffer a large potential to generate reactive power with\ntheir well-controllable DC/AC converters Since reactive power is best re-compensated locally,\n\n\n_∗_ [auer@pik-potsdam de](mailto:auer@pik-potsdam de)\n\n\n\nthese decentral generators are very plausible suppliers\nof reactive power in the DG However, several studies\n\n[1–3] have shown that reactive power can also be transported to DGs’ connection with the transmission grid\n(TG) and have quantified its technical potential for exemplary DGs Several publications propose local automatic\nreactive power control approaches and tap changer coordination [4–9] to stabilize voltage levels Several publications propose local automatic\nreactive power control approaches and tap changer coordination [4–9] to stabilize voltage levels In Kraiczy et al al [10], the authors underline the need for a grid code\nrevision for an automated variable RE control which is\nin line with our research aim on quantifying the potential of such decentral reactive power provision [10], the authors underline the need for a grid code\nrevision for an automated variable RE control which is\nin line with our research aim on quantifying the potential of such decentral reactive power provision Talavera\nand Sowa et al",

Distribution Grid**\n**Model**\n\n\nFor the purpose of estimating the potential of reactive power from the distribution grid on a Germany-wide\nscale, we assume that at every connection of the transmission grid, ultra-high voltage (UHV), to the distribution grid, high-voltage and below, a specific number of\nidentical copies of an average German distribution grid\nis connected – with fully symmetric topology Since also\nthe generation capacity as well as its actual values and\nthe loads are assumed fully symmetric, the complex voltage state at each node on the same level of the grid will\nbe identical in each load situation We thus have to consider only one representative path from the UHV down\nto the LV level for our power flow calculations, see Fig 2 for a schematic illustration Every grid level is represented by a link, realized via\nper unit (pu) calculations, with an impedance followed\nby a transformer with tap changer in the range +/-0 Every grid level is represented by a link, realized via\nper unit (pu) calculations, with an impedance followed\nby a transformer with tap changer in the range +/-0 05\np u u to connect to the neighboring grid level (see Fig 2) The apparent power _S_ _i_ can be understood as the power\ninfeed from one of the _N_ _i_ nodes at each node level in\nour simplified power grid The injections at transformer\n\n\n\nlevel comes from the symmetric generation accumulation Consumer loads are placed at the end of the lines As in\nthe MV and LV grid loads are rather distributed homogeneously along the power lines we take only half of the\nlines’ typical length in order to get the same voltage drops\nalong the lines [1] The topology of the average tree graph structure is\ngiven by the number of grid nodes which are connected\nby lines and transformers (see A 1) The approximate\nproportionality ratios, corresponding to the tree graphs\nbranching, then read\n\n\n1 : 2 : 3 : 14 : 9 : 8 _,_ (1)\n\n\nthat is, for each UHV/HV transformer there exist 2 HV\nlines, 6 HV/MV transformers etc Since Germany’s peak\nload is about 80 GW and there are 606 UHV grid nodes\n\n[12], each average distribution grid has a peak load of 132\nMW The real UHV nodes, however, have different peak consumer loads connected to them Some nodes support\nlarge loads in big cities, other rather supply load-poor\nrural areas We thus rescale each node’s generation capacities and loads to match one copy of our average grid\nmodel, perform the distribution grid power flow calculations, and then rescale its results to the original node\nsize Specifically, we introduce the norm factor _n_ _load,i_ for\neach UHV node _i_ as\n\n\n_n_ _load,i_ = max (2)\n_t_ [(] _[D]_ _[i,t]_ [)] _[/]_ [132] _[MW,][ ∀][i]_\n\n\nwhere _D_ _i,t_ is the consumer load at node _i_ at time _t_ We\nthen normalize the installed distribution power generation capacities _C_ _i_ at node _i_ with current actual power\ngeneration _P_ _i,t_ at time _t_ to our average grid model as\n\n\n_′_\n_D_ _i,t_ [=] _[ D]_ _[i,t]_ _[/n]_ _[load,i]_ _[,]_ (3)\n\n_C_ _i_ _′_ [=] _[ C]_ _[i]_ _[/n]_ _[load,i]_ _[,]_ (4)\n\n\n_′_\n_P_ _i,t_ [=] _[ P]_ _[i,t]_ _[/n]_ _[load,i]_ _[ ]_ (5)\n\nMoreover, if the distributed power generation capacity _C_ _i_ _′_ [exceeds the 1] _[ ]_ [5fold of the peak load of 132] _[MW]_ [ of the]\nmodeled distribution grid structure, it is unlikely that\n\n\nN1\n\n\nUHV/HV\n\ntransformers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLV lines\n\n\n\n\n\nS HV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS MV\n\n\n\nN5\n\n\nFIG 2: Schematic illustration of grid topology reduction to

massive grid extensions We thus only\nconsidered the plausibly integrateable part below such\nthresholds and normalize the generation capacities a second time with factor _n_ _cap,i_ defined as\n\n\n\n**C ** **Germany-wide Analysis**\n\n\nIn the Kombikraftwerk 2 study [11] a 2050 scenario\nof the German power system was developed with 100%\nrenewable energy sources The study details the installed capacities of renewables, storages and backup\npower plants to the level of UHV transmission grid nodes\nin Germany, and developes a dispatch for the full system\nfor each hour of one meteorological weather year The\nresulting power flows in the modeled transmission grid,\na slightly extended version of the grid proposed in the\nNetzentwicklungsplan 2012 [15], and a Q(U) droop control law lead to reactive power demands at each node for\neach point in time Note that the reactive power demand of the modeled\nTG is mostly capacitive This is because the modeled\ngrid is highly expanded in comparison to today, but the\nadditional lines are only rarely used and thus thus behave\nin a capacitive way We use the reactive power demands from [11] and\nmatch them with our estimate of the possible Q generation from underlying distribution grids Therefore,\nwe also used their distributed generation capacities for\neach TG node and the split to the different voltage levels mentioned therein To reduce computational effort\nwe condensed the 8760 given time steps with kmeans\nfrom Matlab [16] into 30 time clusters that cover a wide\nrange of power flow situations To account for the local exchange of reactive power between neighboring TG\nnodes and to reduce the impact of local grid modeling\nerrors (e g falsely assigned transformators between the\n220kV and 380kV TG levels), we aggregated the possible Q generations over a shortest path radius of _≤_ 30\nkm TG nodes outside Germany and nodes without any\nconsumption load were excluded from our analysis **III ** **RESULTS FOR PROTOTYPICAL**\n\n**DISTRIBUTION GRIDS**\n\n\nWe construct three distribution grids with prototypical\nmixes of generation capacities and consumption We investigate their potential for reactive power support from\nthe DG to the TG and the limitations thereof, for demanding load/generation situations The prototypes are\ncode-named and characterized as follows:\n\n\n   - _Passau_ :
