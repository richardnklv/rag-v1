    "Visible light emitting devices with Schottky contacts on silicon nanocrystals\n\n\nS Visible light emitting devices with Schottky contacts on silicon nanocrystals\n\n\nS Fujita and N Sugiyama\nToshiba Corporation, Research and Development center, Advanced Research Laboratory 1, Komukai-toshibacho, Saiwaiku,\nKawasaki, Japan, 210-8582\n(August 1, 2021)\n\n\nWe have fabricated light emitting diodes (LEDs) with Schottky contacts on Si-nanocrystals\nformed by simple techniques as used for standard Si devices Orange electroluminescence (EL) from\nthese LEDs could be seen with the naked eye at room temperature when a reverse bias voltage was\napplied The EL spectrum has a major peak with a photon energy of 1 9 eV and a minor peak with a\nphoton energy of 2 2 eV Since the electrons and holes are injected into the radiative recombination\ncenters related to nanocrystals through avalanche breakdown, the voltage needed for a visible light\nemission is reduced to 4 0 - 4 5 V, which is low enough to be applied by a standard Si transistor There have been expectations that high-efficiency light\nemitting diodes (LEDs) using silicon-(Si-) related materials can be realized for monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits (ICs) Various types of LED based on Sirelated materials have been tried to date Of Si-related\nmaterials investigated, porous Si (PS) has been studied\nmost actively The quantum efficiency and stability of\nLEDs based on PS have been gradually improved [1]\nRecently, Si nanocrystals (Si-NC) have also been studied\nfor their light-emitting characteristics Si-NCs can be\nformed using methods which fit in better with standard\nsilicon technology as compared with PS, since electrochemical processes are not needed Based on the previous\nstudies, it is predicted that the optical band gap is increased [2] and the probability of radiative recombination\nfor excitons is enhanced [3] with a decrease in the size of\nnanocrystals owing to the quantum confinement effect Significant increases in oscillator strength are also predicted at the very small dimensions of NCs [4] Visible\nphoto-luminescence (PL) with high efficiency has been\nreported with Si-NCs formed by various methods: chemical vapor deposition using silane or disilane gas resolved\nby microwave plasma, [5] laser [6], or thermal reactions;\n\n[7] ion implantation of Si into silicon oxide films followed\nby post-annealing; [8] and crystallization of amorphous\nSi (a-Si) films [9] The reported photon energy of the PL\npeak spectra is 1 5 to 1 9 eV (red) for most Si-NCs Blue\nPL emission with a peak photon energy of 3 2 eV has also\nbeen obtained from Si-NCs formed by crystallization of\namorphous Si films [9] The luminescence related to defects in SiO2 with a peak photon energy more than 2 eV\nhas also been reported [8] The number of the reports on\nelectroluminescence (EL) from the LEDs [10] [11] [12] is\nvery small as compared with that for PL from Si-NCs This is principally because the carrier injection induced\nelectrically is more difficult than that induced optically In the investigations reported, visible EL was obtained\nfrom Si-NCs in SiO2 matrix formed by chemical vapor\ndeposition (CVD) [10] or by Si+-implantation into SiO2;\n\n[11] and from a multi-quantum-well (MQW) composed of\nsilicon-nitride(SiNx)/Si-NC formed by plasma enhanced\nCVD and laser annealing [12] The EL in these cases was\nstrong enough to be seen with the naked eye These results indicate that there is promise in using Si-NCs to re\n\n1\n\n\nalize LEDs based on Si-related materials However, as yet\nthe operating voltage is still rather high (10 25 V or more)\nfor the devices to be driven by standard Si-ICs This is\nbecause the Si-NCs in these cases are sandwiched between insulating layers or embedded by insulating layers,\nthrough which the carriers must pass by direct tunneling This high voltage must be reduced in order to use LEDs\nbased on Si-NCs practically A simple structure which\ncan be fabricated easily by standard Si-IC technology is\nalso desired for the LED In this study, we have fabricated\nsimple LEDs with Schottky contacts on Si-NCs and without the insulating layers Visible EL has been observ ed\nform this LED The EL is strong enough to be seen with\nthe naked eyes at room temperature and with a relatively\nlow operating voltage The Si-NCs were formed as follows by the crystallization of a-Si The p-type Si wafer\nhad a diameter of 150 mm and low resistivity (0 01 ohm\ncm) The native oxide was removed by etching before\nthe deposition of a-Si A molecular beam of Si, formed\nby resolving disilane using a tungsten cracking heater,\n\n[13] was deposited onto the Si substrate at room temperature The a-Si was converted into nanocrystals by\nrapid heating to 700 degree C for one or three minutes\nin pure oxygen gas During this heating, oxidation of silicon occurs simultaneously The oxidation is effective to\nstabilize the surface It was known in advance that the\nthickness of oxide formed on a crystalline Si substrate\nfor one and three minutes of oxidation was about 0 5\nand 0 7 nm, respectively, in the oxidation furnace used PL measurements for these samples were performed using the Ar+ laser (458nm) at room temperature The\nstructure of these samples was observed using a highresolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) Metal contacts composed of titanium and gold (Ti/Au)\nwere formed by electron beam (EB) evaporation on the\nback of the substrate Ti/Au contacts 100 x 100 mm2 in\narea were formed on the surface of the Si-NCs by the liftoff process Device isolation was not employed Figure\n1 shows a cross-sectional scheme of the resulting device For reference, p-type Si substrates were also annealed in\noxygen gas and the devices with Schottky contacts were\nfabricated on them The current-voltage (I-V) characteristic was measured at room temperature EL was measured at room temperature using a monochrometer and\na photomultiplier At room temperature, the PL signal\nwith peak photon energy of 1 9eV was obtained from the\na-Si layers that experienced one minute of oxidation On\nthe other hand, there were no detectable PL signals from\neither the a-Si layers without annealing or the samples\nthat experienced three minutes of oxidation Figure 2\nshows a cross-sectional HR-TEM lattice image of an aSi layer that experienced one minute of oxidation Tiny\nSi-nanocrystal islands of almost hemispherical shape and\n2-3 nm wide are seen in the a-Si layer The presence of\nstacking faults between the islands and the substrate indicates that the islands did not exist prior to deposition of\nthe a-Si layer It is possible that the other nanocrystals of\ndimensions less than about 2nm was formed in a-Si layer,\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nsince lattice image of such small crystals can hardly be\nobtained even by HR-TEM The surface of the a-Si layer\nmay be oxidized, though the oxide layer cannot be distinguished from the a-Si layer owing to the low contrast\nbetween the two in the TEM image A previous report indicates that 2-3nm rectangular-shaped nanocrystals were\nformed by a similar method and that strong blue PL was\nobserved [14] In the case of a-Si layers that experienced\nthree minute of oxidation, it was reveled that most of\nthe a-Si was converted into large crystals of Si, whose\nsurface was slightly oxidized Thus, it was founded that\nthe origin of PL was related to the formation of Si-NCs The I-V characteristics of these Si-NC devices show rectifying behavior Figure 3 shows a typical I-V characteristic measured for a device that experienced one minute\nof oxidation Devices which experienced three minutes\nof oxidation exhibited smaller forward and reverse cur\nrents The I-V characteristic of each device was stable\nand changed little after repeated measurements Orange\nEL emissions from Si-NC devices that experienced one\nminute of oxidation were clearly seen with the naked eye\nat room temperature when a reverse bias voltage was applied The critical reverse current for the observation of\nlight emission with the naked eye was 30 to 40 mA at\nan applied voltage of 4 0 to 4 5V In contrast, it was not\npossible to obtain visible EL emissions from either SiNC devices that experienced three minute of oxidation\nor the reference devices without a-Si layers at room temperature These results indicate that the visible EL is\nrelated to the existence of Si-NCs formed in a-Si Figure\n4 shows a typical EL spectrum for a Si-NC device This\nspectrum was measured at room temperature under a reverse bias of 5 0V and at a current of 60 mA Two peaks\nare visible The peak wavelength, equivalent photon energy and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) are 650\nnm, 1 9 eV and 110 nm for the major peak (peak A),\nand 570 nm, 2 2 eV and 30 nm for the minor peak (peak\nB), respectively The FWHM of the major peak (peak A)\nis relatively small as compared with that of a PS EL\nspectrum [15] The peak wavelength and FWHM of the\nmain peak is close to that obtained from a multi-quantum\nwell (MQW) of (SiNx)/Si-NC [12] In the report of this\nMQW, it is thought that the orange EL is due to radiative recombination between the states quantized by\nthe quantum confinement at the Si-NCs For the tiny\nSi-nanocrystal islands seen in the TEM image of Fig 2,\ntheir structure may be not effective for the quantum confinement However, in the case that nanocrystals which\nare invisible in this TEM image are formed in SiOx near\nthe surface, the quantum confinement is possible",
    "However, in the case that nanocrystals which\nare invisible in this TEM image are formed in SiOx near\nthe surface, the quantum confinement is possible In contrast, it has been reported that the red PL (1 5-1 5-1 9eV) in\nthe case of the oxidized Si-NC particles [5] [6] [7] is due\nto the localization of excitons or carriers at the Si/SiOx\ninterface [16] The peak energy for peak B (2 2eV) is close\nto that for PL spectrum of oxidized Si-NC particles reported in another article; [17] where its origin seems to\nbe Si/SiOx interface states; however, the details are unknown In order to clarify the origin of these EL peak\n\n\n\n3\n\n\ns, it is necessary to examine the details of luminescence\nsuch as temperature dependence of both peak energy and\npeak intensity, the size dependence of peak energy, and\nthe time-resolved characteristics of light emission These\nwill be studied in the near future Although the origin\nof EL is unclear at this stage, it is evident that these\nlight emissions are deeply related to the formation of the\nSi-NCs It should be noted that the spectrum shown in\nFig 4 is quite different from that produced by a reversebiased p-n junction of silicon, where the spectrum spans\nthe entire visible range and the emitted light is white [18] The observation that EL is emitted only under reverse bias is unique Though similar characteristics have\nbeen obtained for a LED based on germanium-NCs embedded in SiO2, [19] such behavior is quite different from\nthat reported in the past for those on PS or Si- NCs EL was obtained when avalanche breakdown occurred,\nas shown in Fig 3, where the electrons and holes that\nwere produced by impact ionization have enough energy\nto be injected into the emission centers at NCs On the\ncontrary, when under forward bias, the injection of carriers into these levels is impossible, since the energy of\ncarriers outside the nanocrystals is low Since avalanche\nbreakdown easily occurs in our devices even with a low\nbias voltage, the operation voltage for visible EL can be\nreduced to 4 0 to 4 5 V, which is so low that these diodes\ncan be driven by a standard Si bipolar transistor It is\nsurprising that the volume of the light-emitting layer for\nour devices is smaller by 30 to 500 times than those of the\nother cases where a bright EL is visible to the eye [11]\n\n[12] It will also be possible to reduce the operating voltage of our devices further and to increase EL efficiency\nby optimizing the device structure For this purpose, the\nuse of avalanche breakdown in a p+/NCs/n+ structure\nwill be also effective Thus, the LED that we demonstrated is a promising device to realize a monolithic optoelectronic ICs In summary, we have fabricated LEDs\nwith Schottky contacts on Si-NCs formed by a simple\nmethod These LEDs give EL that can be seen with the\nnaked eye at room temperature The EL spectrum has\na major peak of a photon energy of 1 9 eV and a minor\npeak of an energy of 2 2 eV Since the electrons and holes\nfor a radiative recombination are injected into the levels\nof nanocrystals through avalanche breakdown, the light\nemission voltage can be reduced to 4 0- 4 5 V, which is\nlow enough to be applied by a standard Si device",
