    "g , one\n\nSuperluminal solution was found just by applying a Superluminal Lorentz “transformation”[7,8] Only in the last few years the “subluminal” and “Superluminal” solutions of wave\n\nequations have been systematically investigated, in particular by Donnelly and Ziolkowski[9] (see also refs Only in the last few years the “subluminal” and “Superluminal” solutions of wave\n\nequations have been systematically investigated, in particular by Donnelly and Ziolkowski[9] (see also refs [10]) [10]) Most of the attention, till now, has been paid however to the fact that some —\n\nboth among the subluminal and among the Superluminal new solutions— are localized\n(wavelet-type) beams[11], which theoretically can propagate to an infinite distance with\nout changing their wave shape; in other words they are “undistorted progressive waves”,\nto use the Courant and Hilbert’s terminology[12] Localized beams were discovered as\nearly as 1941 by Stratton[13] and rediscovered by Durnin[14] in 1987 These beams have\na priori an infinite depth of field Durnin termed these beams “nondiffracting beams”, or\n“diffraction-free beams”, while a more realistic name would be that of “limited diffraction”\n(or, rather, “limited diffraction”) beams since in all the practically realizable situations\nthey will diffract eventually[15-17] Durnin’s beams are also called Bessel beams because\ntheir transverse beam profile is a Bessel function[14] Bessel beams are monochromatic\nand are obtained by treating as usual the (scalar) amplitude related to one transverse\ncomponent only of either the electric or the magnetic field of light as a solution to the\n\nscalar wave equation; in a sense, they are the cylindrical counterpart of the plane-wave\n\nsolutions It is interesting that the Bessel beam essentially maintains its propagation–\n\n\n2\n\n\ninvariance property even in its physically realizable approximate versions[14] Due to\ntheir large “depth of field” with a zero diffraction angle, limited-diffraction beams are\nhaving applications in non-destructive evaluation of materials[18], Doppler velocity estimation, tissue characterization, and particularly medical imaging[3,16,17] Besides in\nacoustics[3,16-18], they can have applications in electromagnetism[19-21,23-25] and in\noptics[14,22,26,27] But localized, non-diffractive solutions to homogeneous wave equations can play\n\nan important theoretical rˆole in non-relativistic and relativistic Quantum Mechanics\nfor a suitable description of elementary particles[28] (usually described by unsuitable\nwave-packets that spread even in vacuum) II – LOCALIZED SOLUTIONS TO FREE MAXWELL EQUATIONS\n\n\nLocalized beams have been studied extensively in recent years in both acoustics[29,30]\nand optics[22,27] Recently, a new family of localized beams has been discovered[4] These beams have\nbeen called “X waves” because they are X-shaped in a plane (r, z) passing through the\npropagation axis[5,31,32] The X-shaped waves are different from the Bessel beams be\ncause they contain multiple frequencies, but possess the extremely important characteristic of being non-diffractive in isotropic-homogeneous media or free space[4,5,23] Let us\nrecall that Bessel beams are “localized” at a single frequency, but become diffractive for\n\nmultiple frequencies because the phase velocity of each frequency component of theirs is\ndifferent[33] Even more important, for us, is the fact that the X-shaped waves are Superluminal[5,6,9,23], i e , propagate rigidly with Superluminal speed In cylindrical coordinates, localized beams propagating along the z axis can be written\n\nin the following form\nΦ(r, φ, z − c 1 t), (1)\n\n\nwhere: r, φ, z and t represent the radial distance, polar angle, axial distance, and time,\nrespectively; Φ represents the Hertz potential (or, in other cases, the acoustic pressure, or\nthe velocity potential); z − c 1 t is a propagation term, and c 1 is the velocity of the beam Because the variables, z and t, appear only in the propagation term in eq (1), localized\n\nbeams are only a function of r and φ if z − c 1 t = const ; that is to say, travelling with\n\n\n3\n\n\nthe beam at the speed of c 1, one sees a constant beam pattern This is different from\nconventional focused beams[34] and from the localized waves studied by Brittingham[19]\nand other investigators[20,21,35] In Section 3, we shall extend the theory of the X-shaped beams to electromag\nnetic waves, i e , we shall consider X-shaped wave solutions to the free Maxwell equations Let us start by recalling the well-known fact that, even if Maxwell’s are vector equations, in various cases such as optics and microwaves, they can be simplified, i e , only the\nscalar amplitude of one transverse component of either the electric field E or the magnetic\nfield H strength is considered, and any other components of interest are treated independently in a similar fashion (treating light and microwaves as a scalar phenomenon) This\n\nis approximately true —for ordinary experimental setups— under the following conditions[36]: (i) the diffracting aperture must be large compared with a wavelength, and (ii)\nthe diffracted fields must not be observed too close to the aperture In this case, localized\nbeams developed in acoustics[3,16-21] can be directly applied to electromagnetism because they share the same wave equation (this was verified even experimentally in optics\nby Durnin et al for Bessel beams[14]) Another way to solve the Maxwell equations is to use the (magnetic) Hertz vector\npotential Φ = Φˆn, where ˆn is a unit vector (this implies that the electromagnetic wave\ngiven by the Maxwell equation ∇·E = 0 is a TE (“Transverse Electric field”) polarization\nwave that is perpendicular to ˆn; for TM (“Transverse Magnetic field”) polarization, the\nprocedure is similar) This approach is rigorous, as opposed to the scalar method above",
    "This approach is rigorous, as opposed to the scalar method above But one easily gets (cf , e g , ref [24]) expressions for E and H in terms of Φ, where the\n\nHertz vector potential is still a solution of the scalar wave equation Of course, not all the\n\nsolutions of the scalar wave equation are localized However, if Φ is a localized solution,\nthen also the solution of the Maxwell equations is localized (since the derivatives with\nrespect to the variables do not change[16] the propagation term z − c 1 t) Because of this,\nnumerous limited diffraction (relativistic) electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the\nscalar localized (non-relativistic) beams studied in acoustics Actually, families of generalized solutions of the equation\n\n\n\n− [1]\n∇ [2]\n\nc\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n[1] ∂ [2]\n\nc [2] ∂t [2]\n\n\n\n∂t [2]\n\n\n\nΦ = 0, (2)\n�\n\n\n\nwere discovered recently in the acoustic case[4] One of the families of solutions is given\nby[24]:\n\n\n4\n\n\nΦ ζ (s) = � 0∞ [T] [(][k][)] � 21π � −ππ [A][(][θ][)][ f] [(][s][)][ dθ] � dk, (3)\nwhere\n\ns ≡ α 0 (k, ζ)r cos(φ − θ) + b(k, ζ)[z±c 1 (k, ζ) t], (3a)\n\nand where\nc 1 (k, ζ) ≡ c � 1 + [α 0 (k, ζ)/b(k, ζ)] [2] (3b)\n\n\nThe quantity T (k) is any complex function (well behaved) of k and can include the\ntemporal frequency transfer function of a practical electromagnetic antenna (or acoustic\ntransducer); A(θ) is any complex function (well behaved) of θ and represents a weighting\nfunction of the integration with respect to θ; quantity f (s) is any complex function\n(well behaved) of s; quantities α 0 (k, ζ) and b(k, ζ) are any complex function of k and ζ;\nwhile c is the speed of light (or of sound) entering eq (2), and k, ζ are variables that are\nindependent of the spatial position r = (r cos φ, r sin φ, z) and of time t At last, ζ is the\nAxicon angle [4,37], that we confine in the range 0 < ζ < π/2 If c 1 (k, ζ) in eq (3b) is real, then “±” in eq (3a) represent forward and backward\npropagating waves, respectively (in the following analysis, we consider only the forward\npropagating waves and all results will be the same for the backward propagating waves) Furthermore, Φ ζ (s) will represent a family of localized waves if c 1 (k, ζ) is independent\nof k (containing, that is, the same propagation terms z − c 1 (ζ) t for all frequency\ncomponents k) It must be noticed that Φ ζ (s) in eq (3) is very general It contains\nsome of the localized solutions known previously, such as the plane wave and Durnin’s\n\nlocalized beams, in addition to a quantity of new beams III – ELECTROMAGNETIC X-SHAPED WAVES\n\n\nWe shall now find that the localized X-shaped waves discovered in the scalar case[4]\n\nexist also in electromagnetism, i e , hold also as solutions to Maxwell equations, by use of\n\nthe Hertz potential Let us recall that, in terms of Φ, when ˆn is chosen in the z-direction,\nthe quantities E and H read[24]\n\n\n1 ∂ [2] Φ ∂ [2] Φ ˆ\nE = −µ 0 r ∂t∂φ [r][ˆ][ +][ µ] [0] ∂φ∂r φ (3’)\n\nand\n\n\n\n∂ 2 Φ\n\n\n∂z [2]\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n[1] ∂ [2] Φ\n\nc [2] ∂t [2]\n\n\n\nH = [∂] [2] [Φ]\n\n\n\n∂ [2] Φ ˆ\nφ +\nr ∂φ∂z\n\n\n\n\n[∂] [Φ]\n\n∂r∂z [r][ˆ][ + 1] r\n\n\n\nΦ\n\n∂z [2] [ −] c [1]\n\n\n\n∂t [2]\n\n\n\nˆ\nz, (3”)\n�\n\n\n\nrespectively",

    "And, as in the case of plane waves,\nany realistic X-wave (approximately produced with a finite aperture) will possess a finite\nenergy[5] We shall come back to this question Let us mention that —however— Special\n(Extended) Relativity [see Sect V, below] predicts the existence also of finite-energy (nontruncated) X-shaped waves[39] (Moreover, finite energy, localized beams can a priori be\n\nobtained even via suitable superpositions of X-waves, i e , by suitable superpositions of\nBessel beams) As already mentioned, the beams represented by eq (4) can be particle-like As\n\nthe scaling parameter, a 0, decreases, the wave-function energy density around the wave\ncentre increases The off-center energy density of the X-shaped waves decays slowly\n\nalong the X branches, which might provide a way to communicate with other wave\nparticles[28,40,41] C – An Example\n\nIn the following, we give an example of electromagnetic X-shaped wave For simplicity,\nonly the zeroth-order (n = 0) X-wave is considered Notice that for n = 0, eqs (4’)-(5e)\nare axially symmetric (not a function of φ), and (E XBB 0 ) r, (H XBB 0 ) φ and (P XBB 0 ) φ are\n\nzero The real part of the zeroth-order scalar Hertz potential (eq (4’)) and the electromagnetic X-shaped waves (eqs (5b),(5c) and (5e)) are shown in Fig 1 The Poynting flux\n\nand energy density are shown in Fig 2 Their maxima and minima are summarized in\n\nTables I and II, respectively From Table I, we see that, with the parameters given in\n\nFig 1, the electromagnetic X-shaped waves are almost transverse waves where their axial\n\ncomponents are much smaller than those of the transverse components This is also\nshown in Table II, where the axial component of the Poynting flux is at least four orders\n\nlarger than its lateral components Lateral line plots of Figs 1 and 2 along X branches\n\nare shown in Fig 3 D – Finite-Aperture Approximation of X-Shaped Waves and their Depth of Field The localized electromagnetic X-shaped waves obtained above by us are exact solu\ntions to the free-space Maxwell wave equations In these equations, there are no boundary\nconditions and thus the apertures required to produce the waves are infinite; therefore,\n\nthey cannot be realized in practice However, these waves can be approximated very well,\nover a certain “depth of field”, by truncating them in both space and time One important question is how far the truncated X-shaped waves can travel without\n\n\n8\n\n\nFigure 1: Real part of the Hertz potential and field components of the zeroth-order\n(n = 0) localized electromagnetic X-shaped wave at time t = z/c 1 Panel (1) is the\nHertz potential Re{Φ XBB 0 };

in other words,\n\nthere is not spreading in the energy–impulse space of the wave packet even after its\ntruncation, if the linearity between E and |p| (i e , between the coefficients of z and of\nt in the exponential phase-factor entering eq (4)) is maintained Therefore, after its\nemission (even if in a truncated form, implying a distortion in the ordinary space, but\nnot in the energy–impulse space), the wave packet’s energetic spectrum does not change,\nand thus its group velocity dE/dk is not expected to change too We may conclude that,\ntill when the group-velocity has a meaning (i e , till the abrupt decay of the truncated\nX-wave), v g is expected to remain Superluminal E – A digression: Localized solutions to the free Schroedinger equation We already mentioned that non-diffractive solutions to the quantum equations, in\ncluding Klein-Gordon’s and Dirac’s, being localized and particle-like, can well be related\nto elementary particles (and their wave nature)[28,43] Let us here make a brief di\ngression with respect to the particular case of the Schroedinger equation which, being\nnon-relativistic, presents different problems It is well-known[44] that the time-independent Schroedinger and Helmholtz equations\nare mathematically identical (so that, for instance, the tunnelling of a particle through and\nunder a barrier has been simulated by the travelling of photons in a subcritical waveguide) Those equations are however different (due to the different order of the time derivative) in\n\nthe time-dependent case Nevertheless, it can be shown that they still possess in common\nclasses of analogous solutions, differing only in their spreading properties[45] We are\n\ngoing to see an example of this fact in the particularly simple case of free space The three-dimensional, time-dependent Schroedinger wave equation for free objects\n\nis given by\n\n\n\n\n[h][¯]\n\n2m [∇] [2] [Φ =][ i∂][Φ]\n\n\n\n− [h][¯]\n\n\n\n∂t [,]\n\n\n\nwhere Φ = Φ(r, φ, z, t) is now the wave-function",

    "B – Method to obtain other limited-diffraction electromagnetic waves\nWe have seen that, when new localized solutions to eq (2) are found, the corresponding\nlocalized electromagnetic waves can be obtained [cf for instance eqs (3’)-(3”)] (3’)-(3”)] There\n\nare many ways to obtain new localized solutions to the scalar wave equation, such as\n\nthe variable substitution method, that converts any existing solutions to a localized solution[48]; and the superposition method, that uses Bessel beams or rather X-waves as\nbasis functions to construct localized beams of practical usefulness[42] Let us here add the observation that the sidelobes of the scalar X-shaped waves\n(eq (4)) are high along the X branches[16] The asymptotic behaviour of the electromagnetic X-wave sidelobes are similar to that of the scalar waves (see Figs 1 and 2) 1 and 2) Low\n\nsidelobes are necessary for example to obtain high contrast imaging To reduce sidelobes\nof the scalar X-waves in pulse-echo imaging, recently, unsymmetrical limited diffraction\n\n\n14\n\n\nbeams such as bowtie X-waves were developed in acoustics[16]: These waves are obtained\n\nby taking derivatives in one direction, say y, of the zeroth-order X-wave; when a bowtie\nX-wave is used to transmit and its 90 [o] -rotated beam pattern (around the z-axis) is used\n\nto receive, sidelobes of pulse-echo imaging systems can be reduced dramatically without\n\ncompromising the image frame rate The same technique could also be applied to the\n\nelectromagnetic X-shaped waves for low sidelobe imaging The same technique could also be applied to the\n\nelectromagnetic X-shaped waves for low sidelobe imaging C – Limited Dispersion and Wave Speed\nBecause E or H in eqs (3’)-(3”), and in similar equations are obtained by derivatives\n\nof the scalar X-waves in terms of their spatial and time variables, the propagation term\n\nz − c 1 t is retained after the derivatives Therefore, the electromagnetic X-shaped waves\n\nare also localized beams: that is, travelling with the wave at speed c 1, one will see a\n\nconstant wave pattern in space We have seen that the wave speed c 1 of localized beams (eq (1)) along the z axis is\ngreater than or equal to the speed of light (in electromagnetism or optics), or to the speed\nof sound (in acoustics) For example, the speed of the X-shaped waves is c 1 = c/ cos ζ ≥ c,\nwhere 0 ≤ ζ < π/2 is the cone (Axicon) angle This behaviour is said to be “tachyonic” or\nSuperluminal[39], and has been studied by many investigators in both “particle”[7,8,49,50]\nand wave [4-11,23-28,49] physics In particular, recently (see e g refs",
    "refs [9,23]) it has been\nmathematically shown that all relativistic (homogeneous) wave equations admit also suband Super-luminal solutions: a claim theoretically confirmed, e [9,23]) it has been\nmathematically shown that all relativistic (homogeneous) wave equations admit also suband Super-luminal solutions: a claim theoretically confirmed, e g , in ref [10] (and that in\nthe past had been verified only in some particular cases[7]) [10] (and that in\nthe past had been verified only in some particular cases[7]) Although the theoretical Superluminal waves encountered in this paper cannot be\nexactly produced, due to their infinite energy, they can be approximated with a finite\n\naperture radiator and retain —as we have seen above— their essential characteristics\n(limited-diffraction and Superluminal group velocity) over a large depth of field Each\ncomponent (wavelet) of the approximated wave propagates at the speed of light (or of\nsound), but the conic, or X-shaped wave, created by their superposition travels at a speed\ngreater than the light (or sound) speed The X-waves, however, do not appear to violate[7,39,49] the special theory of rel\nativity, as we are going to discuss below in Section V, when we shall also show that\n\nSuperluminal X-shaped waves, in particular, are predicted by Relativity itself to travel in\nspace rigidly, without deforming[7,39] Since Superluminal motions seem to appear even in other sectors of experimental\n\nscience, we deem it proper to present in an Appendix at the end of this paper some\n\n\n15\n\n\ninformation about those experimental results In fact, the subject of Superluminal objects\n\n[or tachyons] addressed in this paper is still regarded frequently as unconventional, and\n\nin this respect it can get therefore more support from experiments than from theory Moreover, such pieces of information are presently scattered in four different areas of\nscience, and it can be useful to find them all collected in one and the same place D",
    "D – Role of superposition and interference\n\nThe X-waves considered by us are a superposition of Bessel beams and therefore\n\ncan be regarded, eventually, as linear superposition of c-speed plane waves travelling at\ndifferent angles about the beam axis If the aperture is infinite, plane waves will not\ndeform and diverge as they propagate to infinity If the aperture is finite, plane waves\ntravel to a large distance in which they do not diverge significantly: However, beyond that\n\nlarge distance, plane waves, so the X-waves, start to diverge The speed of the X-waves\n\nalong the axis, that is greater than c, is caused by the plane waves that do not travel\nalong the axis but at an angle (Axicon angle) with it If the aperture is infinite, X-waves travel to infinite distance without deformation:\n\nThis is because antennas continue to support the waves from the X branches which extend\nto infinity in time as the aperture goes to infinity (remember that the X-wave extension\nin time is equal to (D/2) tan ζ, where D is the diameter of the aperture and ζ is the cone\nangle) If the X-waves are truncated, they are no longer X-waves in the original sense As\n\nsoon as truncated X-waves leave the source that produces them, they start deforming\n\nprogressively We have seen that the truncated X-waves deforms negligibly within their\ndepth of field and significantly beyond it; the peak of the truncated X-waves happens\nnear the wave axis: it travels faster than c Beyond the support (depth of field) of the\nX branches, truncated waves start to diverge quickly In the limit (infinite distance),\n\ntruncated X-waves behave like a spherical wave travelling at speed c In conclusion,\n\ntruncated X-waves can send signals at a speed greater than c only within the support\n\nof the X branches: but this is achieved at the cost that the wave front must be leaning\nforward in space to form the advanced X branches Namely, the outmost ring of the finite\nantenna has to be excited first; then, since the waves from this ring travel at c, the peak\n\nof the X-waves travels faster than c on the axis The waves deform quite dramatically\nnear the boundary of the depth of field d = a cot ζ, where a is the radius of the circular\n\naperture and ζ is the cone angle Notice that, however, the peak (vertex) of the truncated X-wave is formed with\n\n\n16\n\n\nwave components from the X branches in a continuously changing way as the beam\n\npropagates, so that it does not represent the speed of the centroid of the beam",
    "Notice that, however, the peak (vertex) of the truncated X-wave is formed with\n\n\n16\n\n\nwave components from the X branches in a continuously changing way as the beam\n\npropagates, so that it does not represent the speed of the centroid of the beam This is\n\nparticularly true when the arms carry large amounts of energy V V – A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN SPECIAL RELATIVITY\n\nFOR THE X-SHAPED WAVES\n\n\nLet us here mention that a simple theoretical framework exists[7] (merely based on\nthe space-time geometrical methods of Special Relativity (SR)) which incorporates the\n\nSuperluminal X-shaped waves without violating the Relativity principles Actually, SR can be derived from postulating: (i) the Principle of relativity; and (ii)\n\nspace-time to be homogeneous and space isotropic It follows that one and only one\n\ninvariant speed exists; and experience shows that invariant speed to be the one, c, of light\nin vacuum (the essential role of c in SR being just due to its invariance, and not to its\n\nbeing supposedly a maximal, or minimal, speed; no other, sub- or Super-luminal, object\n\ncan be endowed with an invariant speed: in other words, no bradyon or tachyon can play\nin SR the same essential role as the speed-c light waves) Let us recall, incidentally, that\ntachyon [a term coined in 1967 by G Feinberg] and bradyon [a term coined in 1970 by\nE Feinberg] and bradyon [a term coined in 1970 by\nE Recami] mean Superluminal and subluminal object, respectively The speed c turns\n\nout to be a limiting speed: but any limit possesses two sides, and can be approached a\npriori both from below and from above",
    "The speed c turns\n\nout to be a limiting speed: but any limit possesses two sides, and can be approached a\npriori both from below and from above (As E C G G Sudarshan put it, from the fact that\n\nno one could climb over the Himalayas ranges, people of India cannot conclude that there\n\nare no people North of the Himalayas ; actually, speed-c photons exist, which are born,\n\nlive and die just “at the top of the mountain,” without any need to accelerate from rest\nto the light speed) A consequence is that the quadratic form ds [2] = c [2] dt [2] −dx [2] −dy [2] −dz [2] (i e , the fourdimensional length-element square, along the space-time path of any object) results to be\ninvariant, except for its sign In correspondence with the positive (negative) sign, one gets\nthe subluminal (Superluminal) Lorentz transformations [LT] The ordinary, subluminal\nLTs leave, e g , the fourvector squares and the scalar products (between fourvectors) just\n\ninvariant The Superluminal LTs can be easily written down only in two dimensions (or in six,\nor in eight, dimensions ) But they must have the properties of changing sign, e g , to\n\nthe fourvector squares and to the fourvector scalar products This is enough to deduce\n\n\n17\n\n\n—see Fig 4— that a particle, which is spherical when at rest (and which appears then as\nellipsoidal, due to Lorentz contraction, at subluminal speeds v), will appear[7,39,40,51]\n\nas occupying the cylindrically symmetrical region bounded by a two-sheeted rotation\nhyperboloid and an indefinite double cone, as in Fig 4(d), for Superluminal speeds V In Fig 4 the motion is along the x-axis In the limiting case of a point-like particle,\none obtains only a double cone In 1980-1982, therefore, it was predicted[39] that the\nsimplest Superluminal object appears (not as a particle, but as a field or rather) as a\nwave: namely, as a “X-shaped wave”, the cone semi-angle α being given (with c = 1) by\ncot α = √V [2] − 1 Figure 4: Let us consider an object that is intrinsically spherical, i e , that is a sphere in\nits rest-frame (Panel (a)) After a generic subluminal Lorentz transformation (LT) along\nx, i e , under a subluminal x-boost, it is predicted by special relativity (SR) to appear as\nellipsoidal due to Lorentz contraction (Panel (b)) After a Superluminal x-boost (namely,\nwhen this object moves with Superluminal speed V ), it is predicted by extended relativity\n(ER) to appear[7,39] as in Panel (d), i e , as occupying the cylindrically symmetric region\nbounded by a two-sheeted rotation hyperboloid and an indefinite double cone The whole\nstructure is predicted by ER to move rigidly[39] and, of course, with the speed V, the\n\n−\ncotangent square of the cone semi-angle being (V/c) [2] 1 Panel (c) refers to the limiting\ncase when the boost-speed tends to c, either from the left or from the right (For simplicity,\na space axis is skipped) It was also predicted[39,51] that the X-shaped waves would move rigidly with speed\nV along their motion direction (Fig 5) The reason for such “X-waves” to travel without\n\n\n18\n\n\ndeformation is quite simple: every X-wave can be regarded at each instant of time as the\n(Superluminal) Lorentz transform of a spherical object, which of course as time elapses\n\nmoves in vacuum without any deformation The X-shaped waves here considered are the most simple ones only If we started not\n\nfrom an intrinsically spherical or point-like object, but from a non-spherically symmetric\nparticle, or from a pulsating (contracting and dilating) sphere, or from a particle oscillating\n\nback and forth along the motion direction, their Superluminal Lorentz transforms would\n\nresult to be more and more complicated The above-seen X-waves, however, are typical for\n\na Superluminal object, so as the spherical or point-like shape is typical for a subluminal\n\nparticle Figure 5: If we start from a spherical particle as in Fig 4(a), then —after a Superluminal\nboost along a generic motion line l— we obtain the tachyonic object T depicted in this\nfigure Once more, the Superluminal object T appears to be spread over the whole\nspatial region delimited by a double cone and a two-sheeted hyperboloid asymptotic to\nthe cone[51] The whole structure travels of course along l with the speed V of the\nSuperluminal l-boost Notice that, if the object is not spherical when at rest (but, e g ,\nis ellipsoidal in its own rest-frame), then the axis of T will no longer coincide with l, but\nits direction will depend on the speed V of the tachyon itself For the case in which the\nspace extension of the Superluminal object T is finite, see ref [40] The three dimensional picture of Fig 5, or rather of Fig 4(d), appears in Fig 6, where\nits annular intersections with a transverse plane are shown (cf refs [39,51])",
    "[39,51]) It has been believed for a long time that Superluminal objects would have allowed\n\nsending information into the past; but such problems with causality seem to be solvable\n\nwithin SR Once SR is generalized in order to include tachyons, no signal travelling back\n\n19\n\n\nwards in time is apparently left For a solution of those causal paradoxes, see refs [49,50]\n\nand references therein [49,50]\n\nand references therein Let us pass, within this elementary context, to the problem of producing a “X-shaped\nwave” like the one depicted in Fig 6 (truncated of course, in space and in time, by use\nof a finite antenna radiating for a finite time interval) To convince ourselves about\n\nthe possibility of realizing them, it is enough to consider na¨ıvely the ideal case of a\n\nSuperluminal source S of negligible size, endowed with constant speed V and emitting\nspherical electromagnetic waves W (each one travelling at the invariant speed c) We\n\nshall observe the electromagnetic waves to be internally tangent to an enveloping cone C\n\nhaving the source motion line x as its axis and S as its vertex This is analogous to what\n\nhappens with an airplane moving with a constant supersonic speed in the air In addition,\n\nthose electromagnetic waves W interfere negatively one another inside the cone C, and\n\ninterfere constructively only on its surface We can put a plane detector orthogonal to x\nand record the intensity and direction of the waves W impinging on it, as a (cylindrically\nsymmetric) function of position and of time Afterwards, it will be enough to replace the\n\nplane detector by a plane antenna that radiates —instead of detecting and recording—\nexactly the same (cylindrically symmetrical) space-time pattern of electromagnetic waves\nW, in order to build up a cone-shaped (C ) electromagnetic wave travelling along x with\nthe Superluminal speed V (obviously, with no radiating source any longer —now— at its\nvertex S ) Even if each spherical wave W will still travel with the invariant speed c Incidentally, the above-mentioned evaluation can lead to a very simple type of “X\nshaped wave ”\n\nThese examples are to be completed, however, by recalling that Special Relativity\n\nimplies considering also the forward cone: cf Fig 6",
    "6 The truncated X-waves considered\n\nin this paper, for instance, must have a leading cone in addition to the rear cone; such\n\na leading cone having an essential role for the peak travelling faster than c In other\nwords, in the approximated case in which we produce a finite conic wave truncated both\nin space and in time, the theory of SR suggested the bi-conic shape (symmetrical in space\nwith respect to the vertex S) to be a priori a better approximation to a rigidly travelling\nwave; so that SR suggests to have recourse to an antenna emitting a radiation (not only\ncylindrically symmetrical in space but also) symmetric in time, for a better approximation\n\nto an undistorted progressive wave Let us recall once more that our truncated (finite) bi-conic, or X-shaped, waves (after\nhaving been produced) are expected to travel almost rigidly, at Superluminal speed, all\nalong their depth of field (but only along such depth of field) 20\n\n\nFigure 6: Here we show the intersections of the Superluminal object T with planes P\northogonal to its motion line (the x-axis) for the same case as in Fig 20\n\n\nFigure 6: Here we show the intersections of the Superluminal object T with planes P\northogonal to its motion line (the x-axis) for the same case as in Fig 4 4 For simplicity, we\nassumed again the object to be spherical in its rest-frame, and the cone vertex to coincide\nwith the origin O for t = 0 Such intersections evolve in time so that the same pattern\nappears on a second plane —shifted by ∆x after the time ∆t = ∆x/V On each plane,\nas time elapses, the intersection is therefore predicted by ER to be a circular ring which,\nfor negative times, goes on shrinking until it reduces to a circle and then to a point (for\nt = 0); afterwards, such a point becomes again a circle and then a circular ring that goes\non broadening[7,39,40,51 One may observe, at last, that in the vacuum and in homogeneous media for the\n(non truncated) X-shaped waves the group velocity coincides with the phase velocity VI – CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe have derived and considered various localized X-shaped solutions to the free\n\nMaxwell equations, which possess Superluminal group velocities Theoretically, these\nsolutions are diffraction-free They are infinitely extended in space and time, and —the\nones met in this work— possess infinite total energy However, for solutions that are\nsingle valued and non-singular (finite energy density), they can be approximated very\nwell by a finite aperture antenna over a large depth of interest (along which the truncated X-shaped waves maintain their essential characteristics of limited-diffraction and\nSuperluminal velocity) In addition, localized, limited-diffraction wave solutions to the\n\nquantum equations can be helpful for a better understanding of the relationship between\nwaves and particles Because (practically realizable) localized beams have a large depth\nof field, they have and can have applications in several areas, from electromagnetism,\n\n\n21\n\n\ncommunications and optics to acoustics and geophysics",

    "[53] In particular, for the causality problems one can see refs [49,50]\n\nand references therein, while for a model theory for tachyons in two dimensions one can\nbe addressed to refs [7,8] [7,8] The first experiments looking for tachyons were performed\n\nby T Alvager et al ; some citations about the early experimental quest for Superluminal\nobjects being found e g in refs in refs [7,54] [7,54] The subject of tachyons is presently returning after fashion, especially because of the\nfact that four different experimental sectors of physics seem to indicate the existence of\n\nSuperluminal objects; including —of course— the one dealt with in this and in other\n\npapers of ours: which appears to us as being at the moment the most important sector Let us put forth in the following some brief information about the experimental results\nobtained in such different science areas 1 – Negative square-mass neutrinos\n\nSince 1971 it was known that the experimental square-mass of muon-neutrinos resulted to\nbe negative[55] If confirmed, this would correspond (within the ordinary naive approach\nto relativistic particles) to an imaginary mass and therefore to a Superluminal speed [In a non-naive approach[7], i e within a Special Relativity theory extended to include\ntachyons (Extended Relativity), the free tachyon “diffraction relation” (with c = 1) becomes actually E [2] − p [2] = −m [2] 0 [, so that one does not have to associate tachyons with]\nimaginary-mass particles ] From the theoretical point of view, let us refer to [56] and references therein It is rather important that recent experiments showed that also electron-neutrinos\nhave negative mass-square[57] 2 – Galactic “Mini-Quasars”\n\nWe refer ourselves to the apparent Superluminal expansions observed inside quasars, some\n\ngalaxies, and —as discovered very recently— in some galactic objects, preliminarily called\n\n\n23\n\n\n“mini-quasars” Since 1971 in many quasars apparent Superluminal expansions were observed [Nature, for instance, dedicated a cover of its to those observations on 2 Apr 1981] Such seemingly Superluminal expansions were the consequence of the experimentally measured angular separation rates, once it was taken account of the (large) distance of the\n\nsources from the Earth From the experimental point of view, it will be enough to quote\nthe book [58] and references therein The distance of those “Superluminal sources”, however, is not well-known; or, at\nleast, the (large) distances usually adopted have been strongly criticized by H Arp et al ,\n\nwho maintain that quasars are much nearer objects than expected: so that all the abovementioned data can no longer be easily used to infer (apparent) Superluminal motions However, very recently, galactic objects have been discovered, in which apparent Super\nluminal expansions occur; and the distance of the galactic objects can be more precisely\ndetermined For the experimental data, see refs [59]",
