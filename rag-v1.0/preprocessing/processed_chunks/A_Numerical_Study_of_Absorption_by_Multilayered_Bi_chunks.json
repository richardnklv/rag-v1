    "A NUMERICAL STUDY OF ABSORPTION BY MULTILAYERED BIPERIODIC\n\nSTRUCTURES\n\n\nG Berginc [∗], C Bourrely [†], C Ordenovic [∗] and B Torr´esani\nCPT, CNRS-Luminy, case 907, 13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France\n(May 1997)\n\n\n\nWe study the electromagnetic scattering by multilayered\nbiperiodic aggregates of dielectric layers and gratings of conducting plates We show that the characteristic lengths of\nsuch structures provide a good control of absorption bands The influence of the physical parameters of the problem (sizes,\nimpedances) is discussed The influence of the physical parameters of the problem (sizes,\nimpedances) is discussed I INTRODUCTION\n\n\nElectromagnetic absorbers and frequency selective surfaces (FFS for short) have recently received an increasing\ninterest There is a growing need for electromagnetic absorbers, and in particular for lighter, thinner and more\nhighly absorbing materials Frequency selective surfaces\nare generally made of planar screens with periodic or\nbiperiodic metallizations One generally considers two\ntypes of FFS: capacitive FFS are transparent at low frequencies; inductive FFS are reflecting ones Their behavior at the resonance frequency is complementary Capacitive FFS consist of arrays of metal patches embedded\nin a dielectric structure, which may be a stratified one The dielectric structure provides the mechanical support\nof the FFS Inductive FFS consist of perforated screens Such frequency selective surfaces have been considered\nby several authors [1,6,13] who have proposed various approaches for the numerical resolution of the corresponding scattering problem Efficient numerical methods are\nnow available for the analysis and design of FFS, as we\nshall show The purpose of this paper is to show that the absorption bands of such structures may be controlled by\ncombining the performances of capacitive FFS and electromagnetic absorbers To vary the frequency response\nof a FFS, the standard method consists in varying the\ngeometry of the array elements We give efficient computational methods for analyzing this kind of structure The representation of the transmitted and reflected fields\nis obtained by applying resistive boundary conditions to\ninclude a general surface impedance in the problem formulation ∗ Thomson CSF-Optronique, rue Guynemer, BP 55, 78283\nGuyancourt cedex, France - Birkbeck College, Physics Department, University of London, London WC1E, UK Permanent address: CPT, CNRSLuminy, Marseille",

    "B Numerical Results\n\n\nOur main goal is to exhibit absorption bands, and to\nanalyze the influence of some specific parameters on the\nlocation of the maximal absorption More precisely, we\nfocus on the influence of the resistive impedance Z and\nthe ratio size of resistive plates/period In addition, we\nshow that the location of the absorption band essentially\ndoes not depend on the incidence angle We work with a\nTM polarization for the incident field (in fact the results\nare weakly dependent on the polarization) We consider a series of configurations, in which we vary\nindividually these parameters, in the frequency domain\n1GHz −10GHz In all the figures, we plot the reflectivity\n(i e the ratio of reflected flux by incident flux) as a\nfunction of the incident frequency, and in the case of\nconfiguration II we also plot the transmittivity (i e the\nratio of transmitted flux by incident flux) U pq = �\n\n\nm,n\n\nV pq;p ′ q ′ = �\n\n\nm,n\n\n\n\nI ∗\n�U mn [−→] E mn � - [−→] ψ pq;mn [,] (37)\n\n\n∗\n�V mn [−→] ψ p ′ q ′ ;mn � - [−→] ψ pq;mn [ ] (38)\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nWe start with the case of square resistive plates of sidelength a [′], with variable impedance The period of the\ngrating is set to a = 10mm in both the x and y directions The grating is supported by a dielectric stack of height\nz = 4mm and complex refractive index ǫ = 10 + 2i, itself supported by an infinitely conducting plane (a simple\ncase of configuration I) Since the resistive plates are in\nthat case square plates, we use Fourier-type decompositions as described in Appendix A 1 for the decomposition\nof the surface current The numerical results displayed\nbelow have been obtained using 17 × 17 Floquet modes\nand the same number of Galerkin modes ing capacitive grating (with an important ratio a [′] /a) can\nabsorb an incident plane wave in totality Thanks to this\nabsorption by a leaky surface wave propagating along the\ngrating, we can control the absorption band of a classical\nDahlenbach absorber layer which consists of a thick homogeneous lossy layer backed by a metallic plate When\nthe ratio a [′] /a tends to zero we have checked that the minimum of reflectivity is obtained for the same frequency\nas in Figure 3 To adjust the absorption band of the absorber, we can deposit a biperiodic capacitive reflecting\ngrating on the Dahlenbach layer By doing so, we combine the properties of the biperiodic grating with those\nof the lossy layer Notice in particular that it is possible to decrease the thickness of the layer by adding such\na biperiodic structure, to obtain the critical absorption\nfrequency of the initial Dahlenbach structure",

    "IV CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\n\nWe have studied and described a series of configurations involving dielectric stacks and arrays or resistive\nplates which produce well-defined absorption bands, with\ncontrollable absorption frequency The critical frequency\nhas been shown to be strongly influenced by the ratio\nperiod/plate-size, which therefore provides a good control parameter The impedance of the resistive plates has\nbeen shown to allow the control of the critical frequency Our approach is based on a Floquet (or Rayleigh) development of the electromagnetic fields within the different layers of the structure, and a Galerkin approximation\nof the surface currents Multilayers more complex than\nthe ones we considered here may be described by the\nformalism of this paper as well 7\n\n\nIn light of the numerical experiments we have performed, it is possible to combine the different parameters\n(namely the ratio a [′] /a, the geometry of the patches and\nthe conductivity of the patch material) to obtain optimized absorbing structures from a quite standard biperiodic grating The use of absorption by a leaky surface\nwave can improve a classical Dahlenbach structure The use of absorption by a leaky surface\nwave can improve a classical Dahlenbach structure ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n\nWe thank P Chiappetta and A Grossmann for stimulating discussions C Bourrely would like to thank Prof E Leader for his invitation at Birkbeck College C Ordenovic is supported by Thomson CSF-Optronique and\nthe French government under contract CIFRE number\n400/95 [1] C C Chen (1979): Transmission through a Conducting Screen Perforated Periodically with Apertures, IEEE\nTrans on Microwave Theory and Techniques 9 pp",
