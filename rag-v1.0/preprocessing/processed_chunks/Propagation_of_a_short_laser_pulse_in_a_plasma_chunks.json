INTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a\nmedium [1] is controlled by the dielectric function, wich\ncharacterizes the response of the medium to the applied\nelectromagnetic field The dielectric function of a plasma\nis 1 − ω p [2] [/ω] [2] [, where][ ω] [p] [is the plasma frequency, and][ ω]\nis the frequency of any Fourier component of the wave This simple formula also characterizes the response of\na dielectric medium when the Fourier spectrum of the\nwave contains frequencies that are much higher than the\nresonance frequencies of the medium When a monochromatic wave of frequency ω is incident\nupon a vacuum-plasma boundary, a fraction 2k I /(k T +\nk I ) is transmitted and a fraction (k T − k I )/(k T + k I ) is\nreflected, where k I = ω/c is the wave number of the incident wave, and k T = (ω [2] − ω p [2] [)] 1/2 /c is the wave number\nof the transmitted wave Now consider an electromagnetic pulse with carrier frequency ω c and envelope frequency ω e The formulas for the transmission and reflection of a monochromatic wave are also valid for a\nlong pulse, provided one substitutes ω c for ω When\nω c ≤ ω p, the incident pulse is reflected completely When\nω c - ω p, the transmitted part of a long pulse propagates\n1/2\nwithout distortion at its group speed c(1 − ω p [2] [/ω] c [2] [)] Eventually, the transmitted pulse disperses These results are known to be valid for ω e ≪ ω p In this paper\nwe study electromagnetic propagation in the complementary regime ω e ∼ ω p Short-pulse propagation is generally relevant when the long-envelope approximation is\nnot valid A specific example is the wakefield accelerator\nconcept [2,3] We use Laplace transform and Green function techniques to analyze the interaction between the laser pulse\nand the plasma We find that the interaction can be\ndivided into two stages, one in which temporal transmission and reflection occurs at the vacuum-plasma boundary, and one in which the transmitted and reflected pulse\npropagate in the plasma and vacuum, respectively We\nthen present details of what happens at each stage, for\nincident pulses of varying carrier frequency and duration II ANALYSIS\n\n\nWe consider a laser pulse with electric field E(t, x) that\npropagates in vacuum when x < 0, enters the plasma at\nx = 0, and propagates through the plasma for x > 0 We assume that the plasma is characterized by a plasma\nfrequency ω p The wave equation obeyed by E(t, x) is\ngiven by\n\n\n(∂ tt [2] [−] [c] [2] [∂] xx [2] [+][ ω] p [2] [)][E][(][t, x][) = 0][,] (1)\n\n\nwhere ∂ tt [2] [and][ ∂] xx [2] [are second-order partial derivatives]\nwith respect to time t and space x, and where c is the\nspeed of light in vacuum Let ω p t → t, ω p x/c → x, so that t and x become\ndimensionless Then the wave equation (1) becomes\n\n\n(∂ tt [2] [−] [∂] xx [2] [+ 1)][E][(][t, x][) = 0][ ] (2)\n\n\nIn general, some fraction of the incoming laser pulse is\nreflected at the vacuum-plasma boundary, while the rest\nis transmitted into the plasma We denote the incident\nelectric field by E I (t, x), the reflected field by E R (t, x),\nand the transmitted field by E T (t, x) Since the electric\nfield is continuous across the boundary [1],\n\n\nE I (t, 0) + E R (t, 0) = E T (t, 0) (3)\n\n\nSimilarly, since the magnetic field of the pulse is continuous across the boundary [1],\n\n\n∂ x E I (t, 0) + ∂ x E R (t, 0) = ∂ x E T (t, 0) (4)\n\n\nWe next take the temporal Laplace transform of Eqs (3) and (4) to obtain the equivalent boundary conditions\nin Laplace space,\n\n\nE I (s, 0) + E R (s, 0) = E T (s, 0),\n∂ x E I (s, 0) + ∂ x E R (s, 0) = ∂ x E T (s, 0) (5)\n\n\nIn general, the incident field E I (t, x) propagates to\nthe right (toward the plasma), while the reflected field\nE R (t, x) propagates to the left (away from the plasma) 1\n\n\nWe may therefore assume that E I (t, x) and E R (t, x) have\nthe space-time dependencies\n\n\nE I (t, x) = E I (t − x),\nE R (t, x) = E R (t + x), (6)\n\n\nwhich are consistent with the reduced equations\n\n\n(∂ t + ∂ x )E I (t, x) = 0,\n(∂ t − ∂ x )E R (t, x) = 0 (7)\n\n\nBy taking the temporal Laplace transform of Eqs (7),\nand letting x → 0, we obtain the boundary expressions\n\n\nd x E I (s, 0) = −sE I (s, 0),\nd x E R (s, 0) = sE R (s, 0) (8)\n\n\nThe Laplace transform E T (s, x) of the transmitted\nfield E T (t, x) satisfies the equation\n\n\n[d [2] xx [−] [(][s] [2] [ + 1)]][E] [T] [(][s, x][) = 0][,] (9)\n\n\nwhich follows from (2) We choose the causal solution\n(note that x > 0)\n\n\nE T (s, x) = E T (s, 0) exp[−(s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] x], (10)\n\n\nso that, at the boundary x = 0, we have\n\n\nd x E T (s, 0) = −(s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] E T (s, 0) (11)\n\n\nSubstitution of (8) and (11) into (5) yields the boundary condition\n\n\nsE I (s, 0) − sE R (s, 0) = (s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] E T (s, 0) (12)\n\n\nEquations (5) and (12) imply that\n\n\nE R (s, 0) = [s][ −] [(][s] [2] [ +

that\n\n\nE R (s, x) = E R (s, 0) exp(sx) (14)\n\n\nFinally, (10), (13), and (14) yield\n\n\nE R (s, x) = [s][ −] [(][s] [2] [ + 1)] [1][/][2]\n\ns + (s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] [ exp(][sx][)][E] [I]

Green\nfunctions Γ R (s, x) and Γ T (s, x) in Laplace space for the\nreflected and transmitted pulse, respectively We write\nthe reflection Green function in the form\n\n\n\nΓ R (s, x) = R(s)G R (s, x), (16)\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nR(s) = [s][ −] [(][s] [2] [ + 1)] [1][/][2]\n\ns + (s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] [,]\n\n\nG R (s, x) = exp(sx) (17)\n\n\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that R(s) represents\nthe reflection of the incident pulse at the vacuum-plasma\nsurface, whereas the factor G R (s, x) accounts for the subsequent propagation of the reflected pulse in vacuum Similarly, we write the transmission Green function in\nthe form\n\n\nΓ T (s, x) = T (s)G T (s, x), (18)\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n2s\nT (s) =\ns + (s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] [,]\n\nG T (s, x) = exp[−(s [2] + 1) [1][/][2] x] (19)\n\n\nHere T (s) represents the transmission of the incident\npulse across the vacuum-plasma surface, whereas the factor G T (s, x) represents the subsequent propagation of the\ntransmitted pulse in the plasma We see from (17) and (19) that R(s) and T (s) are\nrelated through the equation\n\n\nT (s) = 1 + R(s), (20)\n\n\nwhich just states the fact that the electric field is conserved The influence of pulse duration and carrier frequency\non the pulses’ transmission and subsequent propagation\nin a plasma can be investigated by considering boundary\nfields E I (t, 0) of the form\n\n\nE I (t, 0) = exp(−ω e [2] [t] [2] [) cos(][ω] [c] [t][)][ ] (21)\n\n\nThe parameters ω e and ω c are measures of the temporal\nenvelope width and carrier frequency respectively, of the\nincident pulse at the x = 0 boundary We give in Table I a\nclassification of the incident pulses (21) at the boundary TABLE I Definition of the pulse classification scheme employed in the text Pulse characteristic

pulse is transmitted across the\nvacuum-plasma boundary x = 0 The first term in (22)\nrepresents the undistorted transmission of a pulse into\nthe plasma, while the second term represents the reflection R(t) at x = 0,\n\n\nR(t) = −(2/t)J 2 (t)H(t) (23)\n\n\nThis is evident by comparing (20) with (22) Equation (23) shows that the reflection of the laser pulse at\nthe vacuum-plasma boundary is not instantaneous, but\nrather a decaying, oscillatory function of time This indicates that there is a harmonic response in the plasma\nto the incident pulse, which produces a delayed, rather\nthan instantaneous, reflected pulse This response takes\nthe form of harmonic oscillations of plasma charges about\ntheir equilibrium positions, which are induced by the incident sinusoidal pulse One can investigate the dependence of the reflected\npulse at x = 0 on the duration and frequency of an impinging pulse E I (t, 0) by calculating the convolution\n\n\n\n∞\nE R (t, 0) = E I (t [′], 0)R(t − t

reflected pulse E R (t, x) has the\nspace-time dependence E R (t, x) = E R (t + x), and propagates through the vacuum in the negative x-direction\naway from the vacuum-plasma boundary, and without\ndistortion We now focus on the transmitted pulse E T (t, x) The\npropagation of the transmitted pulse through the plasma\nis characterized by the function G T (t, x) given by the\ninverse of G T (s, x) in (19) G T (t, x) is found by first\nwriting G T (s, x) as the spatial derivative\n\n\nG T (s, x) = −∂ x F T (s, x), (26)\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\nfor different values of the parameters ω e and ω

    "It is seen in Figs 1 and 2 that the\nreflection response diminishes as the carrier frequency of\nthe pulse is increased We also note that as the duration\nof a pulse is shortened (i e , as ω e is increased beyond\n1), the reflection response diminishes This is consistent\nwith the fact that, as an incident pulse is shortened, more\nof it will already have entered and propagated into the\nplasma before the plasma’s delayed reflection response\n\n[as described below (23)] takes place In particular, if\nω e ≫ 1, the pulse is transmitted completely, with no\ndistortion 0\n\n\n  0 3\n\n\n0 5 10 15\n\nt\n\n\n\nEquation (29) represents the combined effect of a distortionless propagation of the transmitted pulse (first term)\nand the propagation of a dispersive wake generated by\nthe plasma (second term) F T (s, x) = [exp[][−][(][s] [2] [ + 1)] [1][/][2] [x][]] (27)\n\n(s [2] + 1) [1][/][2]\n\n\n\nThe inverse of F T (s, x) is given by [4]\n\n\nF T (t, x) = J 0 [(t [2] − x [2] ) [1][/][2] ]H(t − x), (28)\n\n\nso that\n\n\nG T (t, x) = δ(t − x)\n\n\n\n− x [J] [1] ( [[(] t [2] [t] [2] − [ −] x [x] [2] ) [2][1] [)] [/][1][2][/][2] []] H(t − x) (29)\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nWe next compute the total Green function Γ T (t, x) by\ninverting (18) One way to do this is to compute Γ T (t, x)\nas the convolution\n\n\n\n∞\nΓ T (t, x) = T (t − t [′] )G T (t [′], x) dt [′], (30)\n� −∞\n\n\n\nof intermediate duration Figures 3 and 4 show plots\nof the propagation of ID-HF and ID-IF incident pulses,\nrespectively 0 4\n\n0 2\n\n0\n\n\n   0 2\n\n   0 4\n\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23\n\nx\n\n\nFIG 3",
