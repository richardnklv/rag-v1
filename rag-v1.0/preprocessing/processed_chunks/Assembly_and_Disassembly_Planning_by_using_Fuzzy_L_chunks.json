    "**2 Research Background**\n\nThe realization of an efficient assembly/disassembly\n(A/D) process is a key factor for the competitiveness of\nsuccessful company Environmental regulations and\ncustomer pressure to make more environmentally\nfriendly products, force companies to further integrate\nA/D into the manufacturing environment However, the\n\n\n67\n\n\nefficiency of existing A/D processes is still low because\nof the inherent difficulty to develop fully automated\nsystems and the complexity of performing operations for\na wide range of products (Guide V D R , 2000) Several methodologies have been proposed by academic\nand industrial researchers in order to implement\nautomated A/D systems These methodologies fall into\nthree main research areas related to: (i) the conception of\nflexible A/D cells, (ii) design and develop of innovative\nA/D equipments and tools, (iii) implementation of more\nefficient control systems and (iv) formalization of\npredictive models for A/D planning The implementation\nof a fully automated A/D cell requires a medium-high\ncapital investment The main reason for automating A/D\ncells is their flexibility to cope with a great number of\nfactors such as: product variety, small batch sizes,\ndifferent product states, missing components and\nsometimes inadequate disassembly tools The cell can\nalso work with new equipment and tools In this way the\ndisassembly cycle can be shortened using special devices\nfor separating, unscrewing and grasping (Santochi M ,\nDini G , Failli F , 2002) , 2002) In addition specialized active\nsensors and/or devices must be studied and realized to\n\nassure the necessary reliability and speed during on-line\nproduct inspection because of the limited time for data\nacquisition and elaboration For this reason, a\nstereoscopic vision system is considered more efficient\nthan others for recognizing product features (Buker U et\nalii, 2001) Another important aspect is the integration\nbetween the several hardware elements of the\ndisassembly cells (robots, tool changing station, etc ) and\ndisassembly planning software Such software, normally\ntailor-made and based on the specific application (e g",
    "g mechanical or electronic parts), require the formalization\nof an extensive process-oriented knowledge This\nknowledge can be embedded into the system through\nprocedures applied to the verification model obtained\nfrom the CAD system in order to make comparisons with\nthe real product The inspection system verifies the state\nof maintenance of the product Recognized differences\nbetween the product model and physical part are then\ntransferred to the planner and the generation of new\noptimal sequences is carried out (Salomonski N , &\nZussman E 1999) _2 1 Assembly and Disassembly Planning_\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of A/D is finding\nthe optimal sequence The assembly sequence is\ntraditionally generated by a human expert who carefully\nstudies the assembly drawing and generates the sequence\nin his mind This planning step is very costly and time\nconsuming Together with time and cost issues,\nmanufacturers are becoming more environmentally\nsensible In addition, stricter regulations are forcing\nmanufacturers to become more responsible for the entire\nproduct life cycle As a consequence, the evaluation of\ndisassembly and recycling of products has to be\nconsidered at the design stage, planning all the\noperations to be performed on end-of-life products and\n\n\n68\n\n\n\ntaking into consideration different part conditions\nbecause of deterioration (i e damaged or missing\nparts) Fig 1 1 CAD based Assembly/Disassembly system\n\nIn the process of disposing and recycling end-of-life\nproducts, the cost of handling, sorting and disassembly\nwill play an ever more important role The aim of assembly planning is the identification of the\noptimal assembly sequences of products constituted of\nseveral parts, whereas disassembly planning is very\nimportant during product maintenance or end-of-life\napplications In particular, the disassembly sequence\nnecessary to realize efficient product maintenance can be\nidentified by inverting the assembly sequence This\ncondition is necessary to preserve the product\nfunctionality, avoiding destructive operations on\ncomponents that can lead to useless products In end-oflife applications, the main aspects influencing the\ngeneration of disassembly sequences are the evaluation\nof the financial and environmental impact\nof waste (analysis of materials, energy and toxicity is\nnecessary in case of remanufacturing, recycling or\ndisposal) and economic aspects associated with the\nfeasibility of the disassembly process (Harjula T , & al ,\n1996) The development of a system for the automatic\nrecognition of assembly and disassembly features for the\ngeneration of sequences is currently in a research phase In such a system (Srinivasan H et al , 1999), data on\nassembly and disassembly features and related resources\nare retrieved from the CAD and Resource Database in\n\norder to plan operation sequences (Fig 1) The role of\nthe CAD system is essentially connected to data\ncollection and analysis of the assembly/disassembly\nprocess During data collection, CAD models of the\ndifferent components are re-organized into one model in\norder to restore the original configuration of the product Assembly and Disassembly delations (contact,\nattachment and blocking between components) and\ndirections are identified Related resources (grippers and\n\n\nfixtures) linked to disassembly features are then selected\nto prepare the planning phase The creation of these\nsequences, checks on their feasibility and the\nidentification of the optimal sequence are the principal\ntasks performed by the assembly and disassembly\nplanner The planner must take into consideration the\nplant layout for the machine positions In fact, the\nmachine characteristics and resources influence the\n\nshape of the solution of the process (e",
    "In fact, the\nmachine characteristics and resources influence the\n\nshape of the solution of the process (e g g a change of\ngrippers may have higher costs than re-orientation if\nperformed on one machine, but it may be cheaper if\nperformed on another one) The generated assembly\nand/or disassembly sequence is then evaluated by\ndesigners and process engineers If an unsatisfactory\nsequence has been obtained, modifications are performed\nto the original model and/or to the problem solving\ntechnique in order to identify a more effective sequence\nplan The successful application of these tasks is strictly\ndependent on the problem solving techniques used (PS\nTechnique Database) The application of a welldeveloped problem-solving technique allows the\nreduction of the computational effort without affecting\nthe reliability of the results of the processed model Moreover, an objective criterion must be used to evaluate\ndisassembly sequences This function is normally built\nusing some parameters such as the number of product\norientations or the number and type of grippers used\n(Dini G & Santochi M , 1992) , 1992) Additional constraints\nand precedence between components can be added to\ndeal with the real industrial environment Furthermore,\neasy adaptability to a wide variety of industrial situations\nis required for the analysis of several products and\nmachines Furthermore,\neasy adaptability to a wide variety of industrial situations\nis required for the analysis of several products and\nmachines _2 2 Formulation of the Disassembly Problem_\n\nAn A/D plan to perform the complete product\nunion/separation is represented using well-specified sets,\ndefined based on product features and manufacturing\nenvironment data (Subramani A",
    "Formulation of the Disassembly Problem_\n\nAn A/D plan to perform the complete product\nunion/separation is represented using well-specified sets,\ndefined based on product features and manufacturing\nenvironment data (Subramani A K , & Dewhurst P 1991) 1991) These sets generally contain information on the\nposition of each basic component in the A/D sequence\n(sequence set), tools used to connect/disconnect\ninterfaces between the selected component and other\nelements (tool set) and the product orientation chosen\nduring the connection/disconnection tasks (orientation\nset) (Kroll E These sets generally contain information on the\nposition of each basic component in the A/D sequence\n(sequence set), tools used to connect/disconnect\ninterfaces between the selected component and other\nelements (tool set) and the product orientation chosen\nduring the connection/disconnection tasks (orientation\nset) (Kroll E , Carver B S 1999), The problem of\nidentifying the optimal A/D sequence presents a factorial\ncomputational complexity in function of the number of\ncomponents n This complexity rapidly grows up when\nthe aim is the identification of the optimal A/D plan\nrather than the sequence The complexity of A/D\nplanning also becomes dependent on the number of\ngrippers g and product orientations o The ranking of the\nproduct components in the A/D plan is performed using a\nproperly-designed objective function This function is\nbuilt by considering technological aspects,\nenvironmental considerations, A/D times and costs, or a\ncombination of them In addition the proposed solutions\nmust respect constraints related to interactions between\n\n\n\ncomponents during disassembly, possible grouping of\ncomponents and directional constraints imposed on the\ncomponent geometry In literature, several methods for\nthe problem formulation of A/D planning can be found This formulation generally consists of two steps The\nfirst one is the definition of the geometrical relationships\nand mating conditions between components Fig 2",
    "2 CAD based Assembly/Disassembly system\n\nThe second one is the formalization of the optimization\nmethod based on computation, technological and\nenvironmental aspects With regard to the first step, the\napproaches developed in literature are basically graphbased and matrix-based methods These approaches are\nequivalent because matrices can be built from graphs and\nvice versa In graph-based approaches, relationships\nbetween components are represented using the graph\nsemantic (Kaebernick H , et al , 2000) (Subramani A K ,\n& Dewhurst P 1991), (LaperriÃ¨re L , Elmaraghy H A 1992); in matrix-based approaches, relations are\nconverted into matrix form (Dini G & Santochi M ,\n1992) (Lazzerini B & Marcelloni F , 2000) These\napproaches are very useful if a CAD-based system is to\nbe employed Main geometry and feature data are\nextracted from the CAD model and converted into\n\nmatrix/graph form A typical application of matrix\nmethods is shown in Fig 2, where three matrices (Ay,\nBy, Cy) are defined for the considered assembly The y\nspecifies the considered A/D direction for each matrix The Ay matrix is called interference matrix, its rows and\ncolumns correspond to each component and its elements\ncan be only 0 or 1 Considering the ith row the ones\nidentify the elements that do not permit the disassembly\nof the ith component in the y direction, the zeros are\nrelated to components which do not prevent it The By\nmatrix detects the components in contact with the ith\ncomponent, while the Cy matrix identifies which\ncomponents are mechanically connected to the ith\ncomponent Then the matrices and the gripper list are\nthen sent to the planner together with the interference\nmatrix In a computer aided environment this\n\n\n69\n\n\ninformation can be automatically retrieved from the\nCAD model Once a component is removed, the row and\ncolumn associated to it are removed This process is\nrepeated until only one component is left The final\noutput is represented by the sequence which optimizes\nthe defined objective function The second step is the\nformalization of the optimization method for the generic\nobjective function:\n\nf = f (C,T,E) (1)\n\nwhere C, T and E are computation, technological and\nenvironmental factors respectively Computation factors,\nbasically associated to the maximum length of the\nfeasible sequence, are introduced into the model to\nperform computations Technological factors are related\nto the number of assembly or disassembly operations\n(gripper changes, product reorientations, fixture changes,\netc",
    "Technological factors are related\nto the number of assembly or disassembly operations\n(gripper changes, product reorientations, fixture changes,\netc ) ) Environmental factors are mainly related to\nsubassembly detection, the theoretical value of the\nsubassembly, weight of the subassembly and percentage\nof each material present in the subassembly (Dini G Environmental factors are mainly related to\nsubassembly detection, the theoretical value of the\nsubassembly, weight of the subassembly and percentage\nof each material present in the subassembly (Dini G &\nFailli F 1998) For a product consisting of a small\nnumber of components, the optimal A/D plan can be\nfound using an enumerative algorithm that generates and\nevaluates all component configurations This approach\nbecomes unfeasible with a high number of components\nbecause of the huge number of combinations In fact, the\nfactorial complexity grows faster than the polynomial\none Because of the combinational problem complexity,\nthe size of the problem and the flexibility, required to\nsolve the algorithm, influence the choice of the solution\napproach An algorithm that works well on small size\nproblems can become impossible to be applied to large\nproblems On the contrary too complex algorithms can\nbe time and resource consuming These circumstances\nlead to several approaches to model and solve the\ndisassembly problem, also to limit the computational\neffort The identification of the optimal disassembly plan\nof a product and/or the creation of viable A/D sequences\nare commonly performed using off-line methodologies\nsuch as: (i) operational research approaches, (ii) genetic\nalgorithms, (iii) ant colony, (iv) simulated annealing, (v)\nPetri nets or (vi) a combination of the above (Oâ€™Shea B ,\net al 1998) Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are particularly\nefficient in searching for optimal solutions GAs are\nmore robust than existing direct search methods (hillclimbing, simulated annealing, etc) because they present\na multi-directional search in the solution space (set of\nindividuals) and encourage information exchange\nbetween these directions (Michalewicz Z",
    "GAs are\nmore robust than existing direct search methods (hillclimbing, simulated annealing, etc) because they present\na multi-directional search in the solution space (set of\nindividuals) and encourage information exchange\nbetween these directions (Michalewicz Z , 1999) , 1999) GAs\nunfortunately show some drawbacks in this application,\nsuch as difficulties in finding the optimal value of\ngenetic parameters, problems related to the search of\noptimal values of the weighted fitness function and\ndifficulties related to multi-objective problems In order\nto improve the GA behavior to avoid these drawbacks,\nan integrated approach with Fuzzy Logic has been\nproposed (see below) 70\n\n\n\n**3 70\n\n\n\n**3 Proposed approach and case studies**\n\nActually there is an increasing interest in the integration\nof Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Genetic Algorithms (Gas) According to an exhaustive literature analysis (CordÃ³n\nO , et al , et al , 1997), this integration can be realized on two\nlevels: (i) FL can be used to improve GA behavior and\nmodeling GA components, resulting in fuzzy genetic\nalgorithms (FGAs); (ii) the application of GAs in various\noptimization and search problems involving fuzzy\nsystems (Genetic Fuzzy Systems â€“ GFS) A Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA) is a GA in which\nsome algorithm components are implemented using\nfuzzy logic based tools, such as: fuzzy operators and\nfuzzy connectives for designing genetic operators with\ndifferent properties, fuzzy logic control systems for\ncontrolling the GA parameters according to some\nperformance measures, fuzzy stop criteria, etc FGAs are a particular kind of adaptive genetic\nalgorithms (AGAs), characterized by a variation of their\nfeatures during running based on some specific\nperformance measures A generic AGA can perform the\nadaptive setting of parameter values, the adaptive\nselection of genetic operators and produce an adaptive\nrepresentation of the fitness function Among these ways\nof making a GA adaptive, the adaptation of parameter\nsetting has been widely studied In particular, rules for\ndiscrete Fuzzy Logic Controllers of mutation probability\nand selection pressure have been formalized (cross-over\nprobability, cross-over rate etc ) (Herrera F , & Lozano\nM , 1996)",
    ", 1996) According to these rules, a high mutation\nprobability and a low selection pressure must be used\nduring the initial generation of individuals The second\nintegration method involves techniques such as Fuzzy\nclustering, Fuzzy optimization (GAs are used for solving\ndifferent fuzzy optimization problems), Fuzzy neural\nnetworks (GAs are used for determining an optimal set\nof link weight and for participating in hybrid learning\nalgorithms) and Fuzzy expert systems (GAs can solve\nbasic problems of the knowledge base) In this paper the authors propose a hybrid Fuzzy-GA\nmethodology to identify the optimal assembly and\ndisassembly sequences while improving performances of\nGAs Two case studies have been selected (Dini G , et al 1999) (Dini G , & Failli F 1999) in order to investigate\nand validate the proposed approach The identification of\nthe optimal disassembly sequences of these products was\ncarried using  different methodologies The identification of\nthe optimal disassembly sequences of these products was\ncarried using  different methodologies Fig 3  and\nFig 4 report product configurations,  the component\nlist  and  available grippers to perform A/D operations Fig 3 First Product\n\n\nFig 4 Second Product\n\nSome assumption were made to generate optimal\nassembly and disassembly sequences such as the product\nmust be entirely disassembled (i e e disassembly can be\nperformed by reversing assembly sequence), the\nrelationships between the components were known\nbefore the search of the optimal planning sequence, only\ntechnological and computation factors were considered\nin the fitness function (1) The proposed approach was\ndeveloped starting from a well-known matrix-based GA\nmethodology found in the literature (Dini G",
    "The proposed approach was\ndeveloped starting from a well-known matrix-based GA\nmethodology found in the literature (Dini G , et al 1999) In this approach, a generic chromosome consisted\nof three sections that specify the component identifier,\ndisassembly direction and selected gripper to be used for\neach part The evaluation of the disassembly sequences\nwas realized using the fitness function:\n\nf = w 1 - l+w 2 - (N-1-o)+w 3 - (N-g-1) (2)\n\nwhere constant N is the component number, while\nparameters l, o, g, s are, respectively, the maximum\nlength of the feasible sequence, the orientation change\nnumber, gripper change number and maximum number\nof similar grouped disassembly components The weights\nw i with i=1,3 are associated to each parameter Moreover an enhanced version with an adaptive fitness\nfunction found in (Lazzerini B & Marcelloni F , 2000)\nwas also considered The difference with the previous\nfitness function was the creation of a function with a\nsingle term directly associated to the maximum length of\nthe feasible sequence In this way, individuals with a\nlength less than the feasible one are removed from the\ninitial population during evolution Once the population\ncontains all feasible individuals, the fitness function\nreturns to the form (1) The advantage of using these\ntwin functions was an improvement of GA convergence The Fuzzy-GA hybridization was implemented by the\nauthors onto two levels The first level consisted of substituting the algebraic\nfitness function with a Fuzzy function to obtain closer\ncontrol of the technological knowledge of the\ndisassembly process In fact normally there is not a\n\n\n\nunique definition of the weight affecting each\ntechnological factor (re-orientation, gripper changes, etc)\nand often these weights have to be changed depending on\nthe plant layout and the availability of machines Fuzzy\nclassification systems based on fuzzy logic are capable\nof dealing with uncertainties and can be intuitively\nvaried by an operator according to the machine\navailability For each parameter, a fuzzy set with 3\ntriangular membership functions was created to specify\nthe process condition (bad, medium or good) The fuzzy sets of each parameter were then used as input\nof the Mamdani Inference system, obtaining a single defuzzified output, used to evaluate the quality of\nchromosomes generated by the GA As a consequence, the first advantage of this approach\nwas the use of a non-weighted fitness function, avoiding\nsolution dependency on the disassembly product\ncharacteristics because of the weight balancing Moreover a better response was achieved thanks to the\nnatural attitude of a Fuzzy Logic system to cope with\nmulti-objective problems The second level of integration considered the fuzzy\ncontrol of the genetic operators As mentioned before,\nthe algorithm was dramatically influenced by the\nimposed mutation probability and crossover rate The\ndeveloped fuzzy controller was able to modify these\nprobabilities during algorithm execution The Fuzzy\nLogic was embedded into the controller of a smart\nalgorithm The main features of this controller were the\npossibility of a better allocation of the algorithm\nresources to improve its performance, direct on-line\ntuning of Genetic Algorithm parameters and the\ncomparison between off-line and on-line parameters for\nbetter control The main advantages offered by adapting GA parameters\nat run-time were the improved search in\nthe solution space and a fast growth of the best\nchromosome fitness value independently of genetic\nparameters The rules implemented on the fuzzy\ncontroller can be found in (Cordon et al 1997) A GAbased software program was designed and developed in\nthe MATLAB environment The structure of the\nalgorithm is represented in Fig 5",

    "6 Both the curves have similar behavior\nbut the GA seems to behave slightly better than the\nFuzzy This behavior is confirmed by results in Fig 7\nwhere the maximum fitness versus the generation for the\nsecond case study is plotted At first glance, the\nperformance of the first level of integration seems to\npromote the use of pure GA However these results must\nbe carefully analyzed In fact, a generic Fuzzy Function\nwas employed while the parameters of the GA algebraic\nfunction were optimized for the assembly/disassembly\napplications The optimal tuning of GA parameters is not a simple\noperation but a very time-consuming task because results\nare only obtained after several GA runs have been\nperformed This task is applicable for products with a\nlow number of components but becomes unfeasible,\nincreasing of the component number 72\n\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is related to the number of\nsuccessful identifications of the optimal sequence Considering the second case study, the GA identified the\noptimal A/D sequence on 25% of the runs while GA with\nthe Fuzzy function succeded for 60% of the runs Considering the second case study, the GA identified the\noptimal A/D sequence on 25% of the runs while GA with\nthe Fuzzy function succeded for 60% of the runs Fig 6 Max fitness vs generations, 1st case study\n\n\nFig fitness vs generations, 1st case study\n\n\nFig 7 Max fitness vs generations, 2nd case study\n\n\nThe lower value of GA with Fuzzy function at the last\ngeneration can be explained by the fact that unfeasible\nsequences were obtained The fitness of these sequences\nlowered the mean fitness function value used during\ncomparison On the contrary, the shape of the fitness\nfunction of GA eliminated unfeasible solutions and led to\n\noptimal or near-optimal solutions _4 2 Choice C) versus choice D)_\n\nThe performance of the Fuzzy controller was compared\nwith the performances of GA with the adaptive fitness\nfunction The comparison between these algorithms was\nperformed by running algorithm C) 16 times (crossover\nrate 0 2-0 8 with step 0 2 and mutation probability 0 20 8 with step 0 2) for both case studies The population\nsize of the second case appears to be under-sized with\nrespect to the first case The results of the first and\nsecond case study are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9\nrespectively Different behaviour of the GA appears in\nboth the situations Fig",
