    "## Space-Time Approach to Scattering from Many Body Systems\n\nR G¨ahler [∗], J Felber [∗], F Mezei [#] and R Golub [#]\n\n# Hahn Meitner Institut, Glienickerstr 100, D-14109 Berlin\n∗ TU-M¨unchen, Fakult¨at f¨ur Physik, D-85747 Garching\n\n\nAugust 14, 2018\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe present scattering from many body systems in a new light In place of the usual\nvan Hove treatment, (applicable to a wide range of scattering processes using both\nphotons and massive particles) based on plane waves, we calculate the scattering\namplitude as a space-time integral over the scattering sample for an incident wave\ncharacterized by its correlation function which results from the shaping of the wave\nfield by the apparatus Instrument resolution effects - seen as due to the loss of\ncorrelation caused by the path differences in the different arms of the instrument\nare automatically included and analytic forms of the resolution function for different\ninstruments are obtained Each element of the apparatus is associated with a correlation length (or time) These correlation lengths, determined by the dimensions of\nthe apparatus are generally much smaller than these dimensions and larger than the\nwavelength As is well known, these are the conditions for the validity of geometrical optics so that the conventional treatment, where the scattering is calculated by\nthe van Hove plane wave approach and the trajectories through the instrument are\ntreated classically, is usually valid In the present approach analytic expressions for\nthe correlation functions are obtained The intersection of the moving correlation\nvolumes (those regions where the correlation functions are significant) associated\nwith the different elements of the apparatus determines the maximum correlation\nlengths (times) that can be observed in a sample, and hence, the momentum (energy) resolution of the measurement This geometrical picture of moving correlation\nvolumes derived by our technique shows how the interaction of the scatterer with\nthe wave field shaped by the apparatus proceeds in space and time Matching of the\ncorrelation volumes so as to maximize the intersection region yields a transparent,\ngraphical method of instrument design PACS: 03 65 Nk, 3 80 +r, 03 75, 61 12 B\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\n\nThe usual treatment of scattering from many particle systems assumes the initial\nbeam to be represented by a plane wave and shows that the scattering cross section\nis proportional to the Fourier transform of the correlation function of the density\nfluctuations For inelastic (energy changing) scattering this is the van Hove time\ndependent correlation function, in the case of elastic scattering it is the static pair\ndistribution function [1] The usual treatment then integrates the cross section for\nmonochromatic plane waves over the spread of momentum in the incident and scattered beams In this work we show that another approach is both possible and interesting As\nwe do the entire calculation in real space-time our approach sheds new light on the\nemergence of the Fourier transform in the scattering cross section A crucial feature\nof our approach is that the influence of beam preparation on the resolution of the\nmeasurement is expressed by the correlation volume of the incident beam, which in\nturn, is determined by the optical (in the sense of normal [2] and time dependent [3]\noptics) properties of the beam preparation elements, e",
    "A crucial feature\nof our approach is that the influence of beam preparation on the resolution of the\nmeasurement is expressed by the correlation volume of the incident beam, which in\nturn, is determined by the optical (in the sense of normal [2] and time dependent [3]\noptics) properties of the beam preparation elements, e g slits and choppers We will see that the lateral width of the beam correlation volume determines\n\nthe possible spatial extent of the correlations which can be observed in a given experiment, and is inversely proportional to the q resolution, as in the conventional\ntreatment The longitudinal extent of the beam correlation volume or the correlation time of the incident beam likewise sets the limit to the system correlation times\nwhich can be observed The correlation volume V c is the conjugate volume to the\nmomentum space volume V p and V p V c ≈ ℏ [3] In a previous work [4] we have discussed the neutron spin echo spectrometer\n\n[5] from a similar point of view We have shown that in that case the equivalent\ncorrelation volume is split longitudinally by the ’spin echo time’, τ NSE, which can be\nmuch longer than the correlation time of the incident beam This splitting of the\ncorrelation volume results in the fact that the spin echo spectrometer measures the\ntime dependence of the scattering system correlation function directly When the\nincoming beam correlation volume is continuous (not split), then the scattered wave\nis an integral over all space-time separations falling within the correlation volume of\nthe incident beam and the result is the Fourier transform of the space-time correlation\nfunction of the scattering system as will be seen below",
    "When the\nincoming beam correlation volume is continuous (not split), then the scattered wave\nis an integral over all space-time separations falling within the correlation volume of\nthe incident beam and the result is the Fourier transform of the space-time correlation\nfunction of the scattering system as will be seen below 1 1 Correlation functions and scattering\n\n\nThe concept of correlation (coherence) volume has been applied to visible light optics\nfor more than 50 years including such problems as the effect of the illumination on\nthe resolution of a microscope The correlation properties of a beam as a result of\nthe optical properties of its preparing devices are known as the van Cittert-Zernike\ntheorem [2], [6] and [7] and we will see how this can be applied to both time dependent and -independent scattering A frequently used technique for deconvoluting the instrument resolution from the\nmeasured data is to use the Fourier transform of the resolution function [8] In the\npresent work we show the physical significance of that Fourier transform and show\nhow it is determined by the optical properties of the beam It has been shown in [8]\nthat this Fourier transform may contain more information than e It has been shown in [8]\nthat this Fourier transform may contain more information than e g the width of the\nresolution function In fact it is the correlation function at long distances and times\nthat is often of the greatest importance An additional feature of our treatment is\nthat the instrumental resolution is seen as an integral part of the experiment not\nsomething that is put in ad hoc after the calculation 1\n\n\n−→ 2\nIt is well known that scattering experiments depend only on the spectrum A k\n��� � ����\n\nof the incident beam and hence can be considered as the incoherent superposition\nof the results of experiments done with plane waves distributed according to this\nspectrum This is easily seen in the context of the present work where we show\nthat the scattering cross section depends on the auto-correlation function of the\n\n−→ 2\nincident beam The Fourier transform of this auto-correlation is A k In ad��� � ����\ndition it is usually assumed that sources produce ’chaotic’ beams, i e beams with\n−→ −→ −→ 2\nA k 1 A [∗] [�][−→] k 2 = Cδ k 1 − [−→] k 2, [9], so that in any case it is only A k\n� � � �� � � ��� � ����\n\nwhich is significant This is the case for ’stationary’ beams where �|ψ (x)| [2] [�] is independent of x −→\nThese points, and the possibilities of measuring A k 1 A [∗] [�][−→] k 2 have been\n� � � ��\ndiscussed in [10] and the references therein, and have been emphasized by Mezei [11] For these reasons we feel that it is more convenient to talk about correlation volumes\nrather than coherence volumes as has been the practice in optics [2] since it seems\n−→\nreasonable to reserve the term coherence for those cases where A k 1 A [∗] [�][−→] k 2\n� � � ��\n\nplays an important role The correlation length δ c discussed here and in section 3 has real physical meaning (as of course does its equivalent the spectral width ∆k) This can be seen by\nconsidering that in order to observe the famous two slit interference pattern (Young)\nit is necessary to illuminate the two slits with correlated radiation This is normally\nproduced by having the two slits located in the main peak of the diffraction pattern\nproduced by a third slit up-stream from the pair producing the interference pattern The van Cittert- Zernike theorem is the rigorous expression of this point The two\npoint correlation function can be measured with such a double slit experiment by\nmeasuring the modulation (visibility) of the interference pattern as a function of the\nslit separation Of course the physical situation can be described according to the\nspectral viewpoint, where the incident beam is considered as an incoherent superposition of different [−→] k vectors, by considering that for increasing slit separations the\ninterference patterns for the different incident [−→] k vectors begin to cancel out Recent experiments involving M¨ossbauer scattering of synchrotron radiation have\nbeen described in terms of the beam correlation volume [12] These experiments can\n\n−→ 2\nalso be interpreted in terms of A k However the authors have shown that\n��� � ����\nthe concept of a coherence (correlation) length is very useful for understanding this\nexciting experiment In the following we shall see that these ideas have a rigorous basis We have\npresented the main features of these ideas with some physical examples in [13] 1 2 Examples of correlation lengths and times\n\n\nWe now discuss two simple examples to show the magnitudes of the correlation\nlengths (times) introduced by the shaping of the wave fields produced by the optical\nelements of the apparatus As formulated by Marathay ” the field from a noncoherent (uncorrelated) source acquires coherence (a finite correlation length) by the\nvery process of propagation ” (see [14], p 105",
    "105 ) This is nothing else than what occurs\nwhen a random ’white noise’ signal acquires a finite correlation time as a result of\npassing through a low pass filter, something which can easily be observed with an\noscilloscope For elastic scattering, a beam collimated with slits of width a separated by a\n\n\n2\n\n\ndistance L, will have an angular width of ∆θ ∼ a/L and a spread in momentum perpendicular to the beam of ∆k y ∼ k x ∆θ ∼ k x a/L This will result in an uncertainty\nin momentum transfer q of ∆q ∼ ∆k y On the other hand, seen according to quantum mechanics, a beam going through\na slit of width a will have an uncertainty in momentum ∆k y [′] [∼] [1][/a][ and this will]\nresult in a lateral spreading over a distance δ ∼ ∆k y [′] [L/k] [x] [ =][ L/k] [x] [a][ at a distance][ L][ in]\nthe x direction We see that the correlation length δ ∼ 1/∆q so that both arguments\nwill lead to the same resolution In order to put the argument on a firmer footing we\nneed to show that a wave acquires a correlation length δ on passing through a slit of\nwidth a δ is the length associated with a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a slit The\nproblem is then to show that this length can arise in the case of Fresnel diffraction\n(finite distance L) This is the content of the van-Cittert Zernike theorem ([2], [6],\n\n[7]) mentioned above In this way we can describe the scattering process in terms of\ndiffraction at the defining slits and the correlation length of the incident beam We\nwill be able to describe the scattering in real space instead of in the Fourier transform\nspace defined by [−→] q For a small angle scattering instrument with wavelength of 10 Angst and collimating slits 2cm wide separated by L = 10m the correlation width will be about\n1600 Angst",
    "and collimating slits 2cm wide separated by L = 10m the correlation width will be about\n1600 Angst , i e much larger than the wavelength but much smaller than the slit\nwidth Correlations over larger distances than this cannot be observed with the\nassumed instrument Applying the same argument to a chopper for massive particles we see that\nfor a chopper opening T and time of flight t o we will have ∆E/E = 2T/t o =\n∆ω/ω, �ℏω = E = mv [2] /2� by the usual classical arguments Quantum mechanically, according to the uncertainty principle, passing through a chopper of width\nT will result in a spread of energy given by ∆ω [′] ∼ 1/T and this spread in energy\nwill result in a spread in arrival times ∆t/t o ∼ ∆v/v ∼ ∆ω [′] /2ω ∼ 1/2ωT Thus we\nshould expect a correlation time of ∆t ∼ t o /2ωT ∼ 1/∆ω For a time of flight instrument with pulse width T = 10 [−][5] s and a flight path of L = 5m, neutron wavelength\nλ = 5 Angst we obtain ∆t ∼ 30ps and this is the limit to the correlation times which\ncan be observed with such an instrument 2 A new look at scattering from many particle systems\n\n\nWe will now show how the effects discussed above are contained in a quantummechanical calculation of the scattering Following the usual treatment of scattering\n\n[9], sec 2 1, [15] the scattered wave is given by\n\n\nψ sc ( [−→] r, t) = G o ( [−→] r − [−→] r s, t − t s ) V ( [−→] r s, t s ) ψ sc ( [−→] r s, t s ) d [3] r s dt s (1)\n�\n\n\nwhere ψ sc ( [−→] r s ) is the exact solution for the wave function at the position [−→] r s, and G o is\nthe Green’s function for the unperturbed problem (V = 0)",

    "This more general approach provides a rigorous justification\nfor the usual dual approximation since, in most cases the correlation volumes are\nmuch smaller than the geometrical dimensions (beam cross sections, chopper pulse\nlengths, etc ) involved However in some cases this is not true and the complete waveoptical description of the global system of instrument and scattering sample must\nbe used In addition to precision light scattering experiments such cases include\nperfect crystal neutron optics (e In addition to precision light scattering experiments such cases include\nperfect crystal neutron optics (e g interferometry) where the definition of the wave\nvector is so precise that the correlation lengths can be comparable to the geometrical\ndimensions These cases are sometimes referred to as ”spherical wave effects”[19] In\nfact these effects are natural consequences of the full wave-optical analysis presented\nhere Usual methods of determining the resolution include measurement of a known\ncalibration sample, Monte Carlo calculations and estimates based on assuming a\nGaussian form for the separate contributions to the overall resolution so that the\nseparate contributions can be combined using the sum of squares rule One method of carrying out the deconvolution is to divide the Fourier transform\nof the measured data by the Fourier transform of the resolution function Usually\nhowever a model form is assumed for S ( [−→] q, ω) and some parameters of the model\nare varied until the convolution with the resolution function gives agreement with\nthe measured data In the present work we calculate the incoming wave function as it is shaped by\ntransmission through the elements of the apparatus according to the laws of optics For example on propagating through a slit and/or a chopper a wave acquires a correlation function with a finite width After scattering, the individual waves scattered\nfrom a neighboring pair of points in the sample lose correlation on passing through\nthe post-sample elements of the apparatus We have shown that the probability of\na scattered particle arriving at a detector at a given space-time location is proportional to the Fourier transform of the density fluctuation auto-correlation function\n−→\n(as shown by van Hove) but multiplied by a function H δ, τ which represents the\n� �\n\n\n20\n\n\nresolution of the measurement and is the Fourier transform of the instrument resolu\ntion as it is normally considered This function is the product of a series of functions,\neach representing the effect of a single element of the apparatus on the measurement Changes in one element can be easily accommodated by changes in the appropriate\n−→\nfunction The regions of δ, τ space where each function is significant are the\n� �\ncorrelation volumes for the different elements of the apparatus A measurement can\nbe optimized by maximizing the region of overlap of all the correlation volumes The\nfact that these volumes are seen to be moving as a function of the correlation time τ,\nis a reflection of the fact that the ω, and [−→] q resolutions depend on each other to some\nextent and we have an analytic description of this dependence The present analysis\noffers a graphical method of optimizing each measurement, with the influence of all\nparameters such as the scattering angle included In a forthcoming work we will\ngive detailed examples of how this can be carried out for various types of scattering\n\nmeasurements 7 Appendix - Normalization and calculation of cross sections\n\n\nIn the main text we have neglected all prefactors and normalizing constants in the\nGreen’s functions and incident wave function In this appendix we will show how\ninclusion of these factors leads to the usual expression for the cross section and give\na proper calculation of ψ in as mentioned in footnote 2 of section 2",
