    "# Cybercars : Past, Present and Future of the Technology\n\nMichel Parent*, Arnaud de La Fortelle\nINRIA – Project IMARA\nDomaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay Cedex, France\nMichel parent@inria parent@inria fr\n\nABSTRACT— Automobile has become the dominant transport mode in the world in the last\ncentury In order to meet a continuously growing demand for transport, one solution is to change\nthe control approach for vehicle to full driving automation, which removes the driver from the\ncontrol loop to improve efficiency and reduce accidents Recent work shows that there are\nseveral realistic paths towards this deployment : driving assistance on passenger cars, automated\ncommercial vehicles on dedicated infrastructures, and new forms of urban transport (car-sharing\nand cybercars) Cybercars have already been put into operation in Europe, and it seems that this\napproach could lead the way towards full automation on most urban, and later interurban\ninfrastructures The European project CyberCars has brought many improvements in the\ntechnology needed to operate cybercars over the last three years A new, larger European project\nis now being prepared to carry this work further in order to meet more ambitious objectives in\nterms of safety and efficiency This paper will present past and present technologies and will\nfocus on the future developments KEYWORDS— Automated driving, automated vehicles, cybercars, Urban transport,\nintelligent transportation systems (ITS) INTRODUCTION\n\nCybercars are fully automated road vehicles A fleet of such vehicles forms a transportation\nsystem called CTS (Cybernetic Transportation System), for passengers or goods, operating in\neither a direct connection or an elaborate network, providing on-demand door-to-door\ntransportation The fleet of cars is under control of a central management system in order to\ndistribute transportation requests efficiently and co-ordinate traffic in a particular environment At the initial stages, cybercars are designed for short trips at low speed in an urban environment\nor in private grounds In the long term, cybercars could also run autonomously at high speed on\ndedicated and protected tracks With the development of the cybercar infrastructures, private\ncars with fully autonomous driving capabilities could also be allowed on these infrastructures\nwhile maintaining their manual modes on regular roads Cybercars are peoplemovers resembling PRT (Personal Rapid Transit) Their main advantage is\ntheir ability to operate at-grade on roads, which ensures they are cheaper and more flexible Although the concept was developed in the early 1990’s, the fist CTS was put in operation at the\nend of 1997 in a long term parking at Schophol airport (Amsterdam) Since then, several other\nsystems have been put in operation and many cities are now considering its implementation Figure 1 : First operational cybercar\n\n\nThe future of the cybercars however lies in the integration of the cybercar features in regular cars\n(called dual-mode vehicles) These cars would then be allowed in restricted areas and on the\ndedicated infrastructures reserved for cybercars, and run in manual mode (with drivers\nassistance) on regular roads The technologies used for cybercars are similar to those found in drivers assistance techniques,\nand in particular use the same types of sensors and control However, these techniques have to be\npushed further because the vehicle is not under the responsibility of a human driver However,\non the other hand, the cybercars run at lower speed (they are restricted at the moment to urban\nenvironments) and in a more controlled environments Further techniques, not available on\nstandard vehicles at this time, must also be integrated in the cybercars for the fleet management\nand the interfaces with all sorts of users, who are not necessarily drivers We will now present the state of the art of the key cybercar technologies and the next\ndevelopments which are foreseen CONTROL\n\nCybercars are precursors of drive-by-wire vehicles since acceleration, braking and steering are\nbe controlled by computers During the project, participants have developed new hardware for\nthe safe implementation of these functions However, the main focus has been on the\ndevelopment of safe software To reach a high level of safety in a complex computer\nenvironment, often with distributed processing, a new tool developed by INRIA has been\nextensively used and validated by several partners It is the SynDEx approach which allows the\n\n                                                          development and certification of distributed real time software (see http://www\nrocq inria fr/syndex/) The future of control system now relies in the development of redundant systems for the\nimprovement of safety The development of software in such distributed and redundant systems\nis still a difficult task and their certification is also a major difficulty OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE\n\nObstacle avoidance is the main difficulty in the deployment of cybercars Considerable research\nwork has been carried out in this domain by the partners Now available on industrial vehicles\n\n\nare systems based on scanning laser rangefinders complemented by ultra-sounds and sensing\nbumpers These sensors are associated with advanced control software to anticipate potential\ncollision while eliminating obstacles which are not on the path of the vehicles Other collision avoidance techniques based on radar and on vision have been researched They\nare not yet certified but offer great promise for lowering the cost and improving the performance These researches are conducted in close cooperation with the automobile industry which is\nlooking for similar devices for avoiding vulnerable users in urban environments For the vision, there is a trend to use hierachical methods, with hardware to deal with the\nmassive amount of low-level operations, then sending higher level objects to various routines E g Genetic Algorithms (as the Fly Algorithm) can be implemented in hard and can very\nquickly give some hints of the presence of pedestrians in the path of the vehicle and that\ninformation is used to launch refined, computer demanding methods in these particular areas PLATOONING\n\nPlatooning techniques are needed for the operation of several vehicles closely spaced The first\nvehicle of this platoon may or may not be automatic depending on the application",
    "The first\nvehicle of this platoon may or may not be automatic depending on the application Two\ntechniques have been developed in the project On relies on the scanning laser sensor used for\nobstacle avoidance and the other is based on the development of a linear camera using low cost\ncomponents Both approaches give good results but the linear camera has the potential for very\nlow gap and high speed operation The next generation of platoons will clearly communicate in order to solve problems such as\ninserting a car into the platoon, splitting the platoon or to be able to manage intersection of two\nplatoons (e g at intersections) This will also help with the stability problem of platoons LOCALISATION AND NAVIGATION\n\nThe first automated vehicles used an infrastructure-based approach with electric wires or\ntransponders During the project, Frog has further developed their technique based on deadreckoning associated with relocalisation on magnets widely spaced and hence implemented at\nlow cost This technique allows for fine tuning the exact path of the vehicles and is available on\nthe ParkShuttle II and requires less magnets on the road than previously Other techniques based on localisation by laser or natural features in the environment or on\nvision have been demonstrated These techniques which require no modification of the\nenvironment are still to be industrialised Advanced techniques for path generation in complex\nand dynamic environments have also been explored successfully A low cost solution being developed is to use the same architecture as the obstacle detection for\nlocalization Extracting higher-level feature allows to reduce drastically the amount of data\nstored in the GIS (Geographical Information System) with respect to current low-level maps Then a 2D path is computed, taking into account all the obstacles seen or transmitted by the\nsurrounding sensors: the nearby cybercars share their information in order to enhance the range\nand the precision of detection of the surrounding FLEET MANAGEMENT\n\n\nDuring the project, the industrial companies have developed management software based on a\ncentralised system and communications These systems now offer a very flexible operation and\ncan implement a demand responsive transportation system with minimum waiting times and a\nlow number of vehicles At the research level, new techniques have been developed for the optimisation of large scale\nsystems, including hierarchical control There is an overall fleet control for navigation that\nensures also good redistribution of cybercars so that offer and demand coincide At a local level,\nintersections manage incoming cybercars so that throughput and safety are optimized At the\ncybercar level the onboard control deals with the trajectory and obstacle avoidance COMMUNICATIONS\n\nGood communication between the vehicles and the infrastructure and between infrastructure and\n\nthe users is essential for any good transportation system In the case of cybercars where the\nvehicles are run according to demand, this is even more essential During the project, various\ncommunication schemes have been used and are now operational on various systems: GSM and\nGPRS mostly for communicating with the users through their mobile phones, and Wi-Fi (IEEE\n802 11) for the communication between vehicles and infrastructure High bandwidth\ncommunication is needed in case of transfer of images, for example for remote control of the\nvehicles Mobile ad hoc networks are now being improved to take into account the particular mobility of\ncybercars (e g adapted versions of the OLSR protocol) They are very well suited to cybercars\nsytems since they always offer a sufficient density Next steps are to demonstrate this technology\nin large system and to deal with the handover between different communication means (2G, 3G,\nWiFi, satellite ) ENERGY\n\nCybercars offer the unique opportunity to turn away from internal combustion engines and\ninherent local pollution and noise in the cities All the cybercars available now run on batteries\nand electric motors Due to the low energy capacity of the batteries, the management of the\nenergy is crucial for an efficient operation of the system Various optimisation algorithms have\nbeen developed in the project for the optimum battery capacity and recharging strategy Also,\ntechniques for automatic recharging and for energy transfer through induction have been\ndeveloped and tested HMI\n\nHuman machine interfaces (HMI) are also one of the key elements for the ease of use of the\nsystem and hence for its acceptance Various developments have been done in the project to\nwork on simple but powerful interfaces inside or outside of the vehicle It has been accepted now\nthat the most convenient way to request the vehicles is either through simple call buttons (such\nas for elevators) or, when this is not possible due to a very large number of pick-up points,\nthrough a mobile phone More advanced interfaces have also been explored in the context of\n\n\nanother European Project: OZONE, which develops the concept of \"ambient intelligence\" The\ncybercars are used in this project as a test case CERTIFICATION\n\nSafety and reliability are major issues for the introduction of new systems like CyberCars Traditional vehicles that use the public roads have to meet a large number of requirements, laid\ndown in European standards and regulations For new systems like CTS, such standards do not\nyet exist and the existing standards for other road vehicles are not always suitable Therefore\nrecommendations for certification standards were established as a part of the project These\nstandards will help manufacturers and operators of cybercars to assess the safety of their systems\nand to establish how safe a system should be AKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work on the development of cybercars technologies was partly financed by the European\nCommission Programme IST REFERENCES\n\nSee articles and reports at : www cybercars org"
