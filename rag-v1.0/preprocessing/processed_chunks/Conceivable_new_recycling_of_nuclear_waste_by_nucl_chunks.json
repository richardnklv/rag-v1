    "# Conceivable new recycling of nuclear waste by nuclear power companies in their plants\n\n#### Ruggero Maria Santilli\n\nInstitute for Basic Research, P O Box 1577, Palm Harbor, FL-34682, USA\n\n\nAbstract We outline the basic principles and the needed experiments for\na conceivable new recycling of nuclear waste by the power plants themselves\nto avoid its transportation and storage to a (yet unknown) dumping area Details are provided in an adjoining paper and in patents pending 1\n\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nThe recycling of nuclear waste is certainly one of the largest open problems\nof contemporary science, industry and society Current studies (see, e g ,\n\n[1a]) are essentially conducted under the assumption of first transporting the\nwaste to a (yet unknown) dumping area, and then recycling it, e g , via the\nconstruction of a huge particle accelerator for the individual smashing of the\nwaste nuclei (see, e g , [1b]) , [1b]) Even though technically possible and quantitatively predictable on grounds\nof current knowledge, this approach is not immune from problematic aspects,\nsuch as: the high cost of first transporting and storing the waste and then\nrecycling it (estimated in the range of hundred of billions of dollars in the\nU S alone [1a], with similar expenditures predicted for Europe); the danger to the public caused by the fact that the transportation of the highly\nradioactive waste can only occur via ordinary trucks traveling in ordinary\nstreets (thus being predictably opposed by consumer groups); the long time\nneeded for the above recycling (estimated in the range of hundred of years\ndue to the thousands of tonnages of radioactive waste to be recycled); etc In this note we initiate the study of novel means of recycling nuclear waste\nspecifically conceived to be usable by the nuclear power companies in their\nown plants, e g",
    "g , in their water pools, thus avoiding altogether the costly and\ndangerous transportation of the waste to a dumping area The new recycling\nmight also stimulate a new industry for the development and production of\nthe needed new equipment for all interested nuclear power plants Due to the practical impossibility of building large particle accelerators\ninside nuclear power plants, the only possible alternative is to identify means\ncapable of disrupting the nuclei of the waste via resonating or other mechanisms, so as to drastically reduce meanlives from current values of the order\nof thousands of years, down to values of the order of weeks or days It should be indicated from the outset that the latter means are not predicted by relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) and its underlying Poincar´e\nsymmetry P (3 1) because, in their realization via the familiar Dirac equation, the latter structures predict perennial and immutable meanlives Thus,\nquantitative studies of the desired new forms of recycling nuclear waste “in\nhouse” require a suitable broadening of RQM and related Poincar´e symmetry In this note we recall that RQM is exactly valid for the atomic structure\nbut not for the nuclear structure with predicted small deviations of crucial\n\n\n2\n\n\nrelevance for the desired recycling; we point out a broadening of RQM known\nunder the name of relativistic hadronic mechanics (RHM) with corresponding\nbroadening of its basic Poincar´e symmetry, specifically constructed for the\nnuclear structure with extended and deformable nucleons; we point out that\nthe alterability of the intrinsic magnetic moment of nucleons is a necessary\ncondition for the representation of total nuclear magnetic moments and we\npresent its first exact-numerical representation via RHM under conventional\nvalues of spin and angular momentum; we indicate that the alterability of\nthe intrinsic magnetic moments of the neutron implies the alterability of its\nmeanlife via subnuclear processes; we present the basic principle of the proposed new recycling of nuclear waste based on subnuclear resonating mechanism which stimulate the beta decay of the neutron; and we finally point\nout three fundamental experiments which are essential for additional studies\nin the proposed new recycling A detailed presentation is available in the adjoining paper [1c] and in\npatents pending The reader should be warned against unreasonable expectations of quick solutions in view of the magnitude and complexity of the\nproblem whose solution will predictably require a comprehensive collegial effort encompassing all current and new scientific and industrial knowledge in\nnuclear physics ### 2 Lack of exact character of relativistic quantum mechanics in nuclear physics\n\n\nRQM resulted to be exact for the atomic structure because it represented\nin an exact way all its experimental data By comparison, RQM cannot\nbe exact for the nuclear structure because it has been unable to provide\nan exact representation of all its experimental data, such as total magnetic\nmoments and other data [2] The understanding is that RQM does indeed\nprovide a good approximation of nuclear data However, as we shall see, even\nthough evidently small, the expected deviations have a fundamental role for\nthe desired new recycling of nuclear waste The lack of exact character of RQM in nuclear physics can also be seen\nin a number of independent ways, a compelling one being that based on\nsymmetries Computer visualization of the Poincar´e symmetry indicates its\n\n\n3\n\n\ncapability to represent Keplerian systems, i e",
    "e , systems with the heaviest constituent in the center, as occurring in the atomic structure By comparison,\nnuclei do not have nuclei and, therefore, the Poincar´e symmetry must be\nbroken to represent structures without the Keplerian center In turn, as we\nshall see, the latter breaking is fully in line with the deviations from P (3 1)\nrequired by the representation of nuclear magnetic moments The most compelling arguments are of dynamical nature RQM was constructed for the characterization of action-at-a-distance interactions deriv\nable from a potential, as occurring in the atomic structure By comparison,\nnucleons in a nuclear structure are in an average state of mutual penetration of about 10 [−][3] parts of their charge distribution [3a] But hadrons are\nsome of the densest objects measured in laboratory until now Their mutual\npenetration therefore implies a (generally small) component of the nuclear\nforce which is: 1) of contact type i e , with zero-range, thus requiring new\ninteractions without particle exchanges; 2) nonlinear in the wave functions\nand, possibly, their derivatives, thus requiring a theory with an exact superposition principle under said nonlinearity; 3) nonlocal, e , with zero-range, thus requiring new\ninteractions without particle exchanges; 2) nonlinear in the wave functions\nand, possibly, their derivatives, thus requiring a theory with an exact superposition principle under said nonlinearity; 3) nonlocal, e g g , of integral-type\nover the volume of overlapping, thus requiring a new topology; 4) nonpotential, in the sense of violating the conditions to be derivable from a potential\nor a Hamiltonian [3b], thus requiring new dynamical equations; and 5) of\nconsequential nonunitarity type as a necessary condition to exit from the\nequivalence class of RQM, thus requiring new mathematical methods ### 3 Relativistic hadronic mechanics\n\n\nThe insufficiencies of RQM for the nuclear structure (as well as for the structure of hadrons and stars here ignored) have been recognized by various\nphysicists, resulting in a number of research lines, such as the well known\nq-deformations, quantum groups, and others Unfortunately, even though\nmathematically impeccable, these deformations are afflicted by a number of\nproblematic aspects of physical character [3c], besides implying an evident\ndeparture from the axioms of the special relativity (SR) In this note we use a covering of RQM known as relativistic hadronic\nmechanics (RHM), originally submitted and studied by Santilli [4] (for independent studies see monographs [5] and papers quoted therein), which\napparently resolves the above problematic aspects, and permits quantitative\n\n\n4\n\n\nand invariant studies of nuclear structures with extended, nonspherical and\ndeformable nucleons under nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary nuclear forces\n\n[4h] RHM is constructed via axiom-preserving maps of RQM called isotopies\n\n[4a] here referred to maps of any given linear, local-differential and unitary\ntheory into its most general possible nonlinear, nonlocal-integral and nonunitary extensions which are nevertheless capable of reconstructing linearity,\nlocality and unitarity on certain generalized spaces called isospaces, over certain generalized fields called isofields The alterations characterized by RHM\nare called mutations [6] in order to distinguish them from the “deformations”\nof the current literature The representation of physical systems via RHM requires [1c,4h] the\nknowledge of two quantities: the Hamiltonian H for the representation of\nall potential interactions; and the isotopic generalization of the conventional\nunit I = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) of RQM, called isounit, I [ˆ] = Diag(n 1 [2], n 2 [2], n 3 [2], n 4 [2] ) ×\nˆΓ(x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, ) = ˆI [†] - 0, where n 1 [2], n 2 [2], n 3 [2] represent extended, nonspherical and deformable shapes of the nucleons under the volume preserving\ncondition n 1 [2] × n 2 [2] × n 3 [2] = 1, n 4 [2] represents the density of the medium in\nwhich motion occurs (e g , the square of the local index of refraction), and Γ [ˆ]\nrepresent all nonlinear, nonlocal and nonpotential interactions The isotopic lifting of the basic (multiplicative) unit I → I [ˆ] requires, for\nconsistency, the corresponding lifting of the conventional associative product\nA × B of RQM into the isoproduct A× [ˆ] B = A × T [ˆ] × B, I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1], under\nwhich I [ˆ] is the correct left and right unit of the new theory, I [ˆ] × [ˆ] A ≡ A× [ˆ] I [ˆ] ≡ A\n\n[4a] The totality of the products of RHM must therefore be isotopic for\nconsistency A realization of RHM specifically conceived for the nuclear structure is\npresented in the adjoining paper [1c] In essence, RQM can be reconstructed\nwith respect to the new isounit I [ˆ] with isoproduct A× [ˆ] B via the use of nonunitary transforms In fact, for U × U [†] ≠ I, the isounit is precisely given by the\ntransform I → I [ˆ] = U × I × U [†] = I [ˆ] [†], the isoproduct is precisely given by the\ntransformˆ A × B → U × A × B × U [†] = A [ˆ] × T [ˆ] × B [ˆ] = A [ˆ] × [ˆ] B [ˆ], A [ˆ] = U × A × U [†],\nB = U ×B ×U [†], ˆT = (U ×U [†] ) [−][1] = ˆI [−][1], the fundamental relativistic commutation rules are subjected to the map [p µ, x [ν] ] = δ µν × I → U × [p µ, x ν ] × U - =\n\n[ˆp µ ˆ,xˆ [ν] ] = ˆp µ × [ˆ] xˆ [ν] − xˆ [ν] [ ˆ] ×pˆ µ = −iδ µν × ˆI, etc The reader should be aware that the above procedure implies: new field\n\n\n5\n\n\nˆ\nF (= ˆR or ˆC of real or complex) isonumbers ˆn = n× ˆI [4c]; new isodifferential\ncalculus with dx [ˆ] [µ] = I [ˆ] ν [µ] [×][dx] [ν] [, ˆ][∂/][∂x][ˆ] [ = ˆ][T] µ [ ν] [∂/∂x] [ν] [ [4g]; new][ isolinear momentum]\noperator ˆp µ ×| [ˆ] ψ > [ˆ] = −i∂ [ˆ] µ |ψ > [ˆ] = −iT [ˆ] µ [ν] [∂] [ν] [|][ ˆ][ψ >][;

new Lie-Santilli isotheory [5] based on the isoproduct [ ˆA, ˆB] = ˆA× ˆB −\nB ˆ× ˆA [3b,4a]; new iso-Minkowski space [4e] ˆM over R [ˆ] with isounit I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1],\nisometric N [ˆ] µν = ˆη µν × I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] µ [α] [(][x,][ ˙][x,][ ˆ][ψ, ∂][ψ, ][ˆ] [)] [×] [η] [αν] [×][ ˆ][I][,][ η][ = diag (1][,][ 1][,][ 1][,][ −][1),]\n\nˆ\nand isoseparation (ˆ x − y) [ˆ2] = [(x − y) [µ] η µν (x − y) [ν] ] × I [ˆ] ∈ R [ˆ] ; a new image\nP (3 1) of the Poincar´e symmetry first introduced by Santilli [4d-4f] under\nthe name of iso-Poincar´e symmetry; new isofunctional analysis [5c,5e]; etc For the reconstruction in isospaces over isofields of all axiomatic properties of\nRQM, such as hermiticity, real-valuedness of Hermitean operators, linearity,\nlocality, unitarity, etc , we are forced to refer the reader to ref",
    ", we are forced to refer the reader to ref [1c,4h] We merely recall here that P [ˆ] (3 1) is the image of P (3 1) for the new unit\n\nˆ\nI As such, ˆP (3 1) is the universal invariance of the isoseparation (x − y) [ˆ2],\nthat is, of a geometry whose unit I [ˆ] directly represents extended, nonspherical\nand deformable particles under unrestricted, generally nonunitary external\nforces As such, computer visualization of P [ˆ] (3 1) show the desired removal\nof the Keplerian center, as assured by the presence of contact/zero-range\ninteractions We should also recall that RHM is characterized by new degrees of freedom of RQM axioms which are given for constant I [ˆ] = n [2] by the Hilbert\nspace law < φ|×|ψ > ×I ≡< φ|× n [−][2] ×|ψ > ×n [2] =< φ|× I [ˆ] × ψ > ×I [ˆ] with\nMinkowskian counterpart x [2] = (x [µ] ×η µν ×x [ν] ) ×I ≡ (x [µ] ×(n [−][2] ×η µν ) ×x [ν] ) ×\nn [2] = (x [µ] × ˆη µν × x [ν] ) × I [ˆ] Note that these new invariances have remained\nundetected during this century because they required the prior discivery of\nnew numbers with arbitrary units I [ˆ] [4c] Also, RHM provides an explicit and concrete “operator” realization of the\n“hidden variables”ˆ λ = T [ˆ] (x, ψ, [ˆ] ) via the isoeigenvalue equation H [ˆ] ×| [ˆ] ψ > [ˆ] =\nH × λ × | ˆψ >= ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ >= (E × λ [−][1] ) × λ × | ˆψ >= E × | ˆψ > As such,\nRHM is a form of “completion” of RQM much along the celebrated argument\nby Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen for which von Neumann’s theorem, Bell’s\ninequalities and all that do not apply owing to the underlying nonunitary\nstructure (see [1c,4h] for details) An important property is that (for positive-definite isounits) all isotopic\n\n\n6\n\n\nˆ\nstructures are locally isomorphic to the original ones, ˆ F [ˆ] ≈ F, H ≈H,\nM ≈ M, P [ˆ] (3 1) ≈ P (3 1), etc , and they coincide at the abstract, realizationfree level by conception and construction Possible criticisms on the axiomatic structure of RHM (generally due to lack of sufficient technical knowledge of this new field) are therefore criticisms on the axiomatic structure of\nRQM In fact, RHM is not a new mechanics, but merely a new realization\nof the abstract axioms of RQM, although the two realizations are physically\ninequivalent because connected by nonunitary transforms The reader should be aware that RHM admits a hierarchy of realizations to represent a hiererchy of physical conditions of increasing complexity,\nranging from the minimal conditions of mutual overlapping of hadrons in\nthe nuclear structure, to their maximal conditions of mutual penetration in\nthe interior of collapsing stars The realization needed for nuclear physics is\nconstructed for the first time in the adjoint paper [1c], and it is conceived to\npreserve conventional quantum laws In fact, we have the conventional uncertainties ∆ˆr∆ˆp ≥ [1] [<][ [ˆ][p,][ ˆ][x][] =] [ 1] [<][ ˆ][ψ][| ×][ ˆ][T][ ×][ ˆ][I][ ×][ ˆ][T] [|][ ˆ][ψ > /

[ 1] 2 [and related Pauli’s exclusion principle; and]\n\nother conventional laws Note that this implies the preservation by RHM\nof causality under nonlocal interactions (because they are embedded in the\nunit), the validity of the superposition principle for a highly nonlinear theory\n(because of the reconstruction of linearity in isospace), the invariance under\nnonunitary time evolutions (because they are reduced to the isounitary law\nW = W [ˆ] × T [ˆ] [1][/][2], W × W [†] ≡ W [ˆ] × [ˆ] W [ˆ] [†] = W [ˆ] [†] [ ˆ] ×W [ˆ] = I [ˆ] ̸= I), and other features\n\n[1c,4h] which are impossible for the conventional formalism of RQM Above all, RHM is based on the requirement of preserving the axioms\nof the SR and merely realize them in isospace M [ˆ] under the isosymmetry P [ˆ]\n(3 1) [4] This permits to extend the applicability of the SR from the current\nrestriction to elm waves or perfectly spherical and rigid bodies moving in\nvacuum with maximal speed c 0, to elm waves or nonspherical-deformable\nbodies moving within physical media with maximal speed c = c 0 /n 4 In\nparticular, the maximal causal speed on M [ˆ] remains c 0 because in the fourth\ncomponent of the isotopic line element we have the lifting c 0 [2] → c [2] = c 0 [2] /n 4 [2],\nwith the inverse lifting of the related unit I 44 = I → I [ˆ] 44 = n 4 [2], under which\nthe conventional value c 0 is invariant, thus rendering the SR universal [4h] Nowadays RHM possesses several preliminary, yet numerical and significant verifications in nuclear physics, particle physics, astrophysics, superconductivity, biology and other fields which we cannot possibly review here for\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nlack of space [4,5] ### 4 Exact representation of total nuclear magnetic moments\n\n\nAs indicated earlier, total nuclear magnetic moments still lack an exact representation via RQM after three-quarter of a century of studies For instance,\nfor the deuteron we have the value ˆµ [exp] D = 0 857, while: quantum mechanics\nyields the value µ [theor] QM [= 0][ ][880 which is 2 6 % off][ in excess][ [2a]; all possible]\ncorrections via RQM still remain with about 1 % off [2b]; and the problem\ndoes not appear to be solvable via quark models because the quark orbits\nare too small to yield the needed deviation The most plausible explanation of the above occurrence was formulated\nby the Founding Fathers of nuclear physics in the late 1940’s [2a] Recall\nthat nucleons are not point like, but have extended charge distributions with\nthe radius of about 1 fm Since perfectly rigid bodies do not exist in nature,\nthe above “historical hypothesis” (as hereon referred to) assumes that such\ndistributions can be deformed under sufficient external forces But the deformation of a charged and spinning sphere implies a necessary alteration of\nits intrinsic magnetic moment In turn, this permits the exact representation\nof total nuclear magnetic moments as shown below Our fundamental assumption is that the exact representation of total nuclear magnetic moments requires the lifting RQM → RHM, with basic lifting\nP (3 1) → P [ˆ] (3 1) As recalled earlier, the intrinsic characteristics of nucleons\nare perennial and immutable under P (3 1), while P [ˆ] (3 1) has been constructed\nprecisely to represent their alterability under sufficient conditions One of the first experimental verifications of RHM is then the exactnumerical representation of total nuclear magnetic moments It was presented for the first time in ref [6] under a joint mutation of angular momentum and spin In this note we give a new representation under mutated\nmagnetic moments but conventional values of angular momentum and spin The fundamental equation of RHM needed for quantitative treatment\nof the historical hypothesis is the isotopic image of Dirac’s equation, called\niso-Dirac equation [4h] It is characterized by a nonunitary image of the\nconventional equation and can be written for total 6-dimensional isounits\n\n\n8\n\n\nˆ\nIˆ tot = ˆI [orb] × ˆI [spin], ˆI [orb] = Diag (n 1 [2], n 2 [2], n 3 [2], n 4 [2] ) × ˆΓ = Diag (ˆI 11, ˆI 22, ˆI 33, ˆI 44 ),\nI [spin] = U [spin] × U [†][spin] = ˆ̸ I (see [1c] for details)\n\n\norb ˆ spin ˆˆ ˆˆ ˆ2 orb ˆ\n\n[ N [ˆ] [µν] [ ˆ] × γ µ ˆ× (ˆp ν − i×e× ˆA ν ) − i × ˆm ]ˆ× ψ = 0, (1a)\n\n{γˆ µ ˆ,γˆ α } = ˆγ µ × T [ˆ] [spin] × ˆγ α + ˆγ α × T [ˆ] [spin] × ˆγ µ = 2ˆη µα × I [ˆ] [spin], (1b)\n\nγˆ µ = ( T [ˆ] µµ [orb] [)] [1][/][2] [ ×][ U] [spin] [ ×][ γ] [µ] [ ×][ U] [†][spin] [ ×][ ˆ][I] [spin] [,] (1c)\n\nwhere [ˆ] i× [ˆ] eˆ× [ˆ] A [ˆ] µ = (i × e × A µ ) × I [ˆ] and the elm potential A µ is conventional,\nbeing external and long range As one can see, the above equation represents particles, which: a) are\nextended and deformable with all infinitely possible ellipsoidical shapes with\nsemiaxes n 1 [2], n 2 [2], n 3 [2] (under the volume preserving condition n 1 [2] × n 2 [2] ×\nn 3 [2] = 1) ; b) propagating within a physical medium with index of refraction\nn 4 (of value generally different than 1); and c) under conventional electromagnetic interactions plus unrestricted external forces (represented by Γ) [ˆ]\nWhen a system is considered from the exterior, all nonlocal-nonpotential internal effects must evidently be averaged into constants (due to their short\nrange character), as it is the case for total nuclear magnetic moments This\nyields a mere isorenormalization of the n µ ’s hereon tacitly implied It is easy to see that iso-Dirac equation (1) preserves the conventional\neigenvalues of angular momentum and spin due to its very construction via\nnonunitary transform of conventional equations (see [1c] for details), while\nproviding the desired mutation of the magnetic moment of nucleons [4b,6,1b]\n\n\nµˆ N = µ N × n 4 /n 3, N = n or p (2)\n\n\nThe application to the exact representation of total nuclear magnetic\nmoments is straightforward Assume to a good approximation that protons\nand neutrons have the same shape (n kn = n kp ) and that they move in the\nsame medium (n 4n = n 4p ) Then, a simple isotopy of the QM model [2a]\nyields the RHM model for the total nuclear magnetic moments\n\n\nˆ\nµ [tot] = � (ˆg k [L] [×][ ˆ] M k3 + ˆg k [S] [×][ ˆ][S] [k][3] [)][,] (3a)\n\nk\n\n\nˆ ˆ\ng n = g n n 4 /n 3 ≈ g n /n 3, g p = g p n 4 /n 3 ≈ g p /n 3, (3b)\n\n\n9\n\n\nwhere eh/¯ 2m p c 0 = 1, g n [S] = −3 816, g p [S] = 5 585, g n [L] = 0, g p [L] = 1 As an\nillustration, the above model yields the following exact representation of the\ndeuteron magnetic moment\n\n\nˆ exp\nµ [tot] theor [=][ g] [p] [n] [4][p] [/n] [3][p] [ +][ g] [n] [n] [4][n] [/n] [3][n] [ ≈] [(][g] [p] [ +][ g] [n] [)][n] [4] [/n] [3] [ ≡] [µ] [D] = 0 857, (4a)\n\n\nn 42 = 1 000, n 32 = 1 054, n 12 = n 22 = (1/n 32 ) 1/2 = 0 974 (4b)\n\n\nAs one can see, µ D [exp] is exactly represented by merely assuming that the\ncharge distribution of the nucleons in the deuteron experiences a deformation\nof shape of about 1/2 % Note that the mutation is of prolate character which\nimplies a decrease of the (absolute value of the) intrinsic magnetic moment of\nnucleons exactly as needed Note also that the representation is of geometric\ncharacter; it is independent from any assumed nucleon constituent; and it\nidentifies the polarization of the constituent orbits which is needed for their\ncompliance with physical reality Corrections due to the value n 4 ̸= 1 for\nthe deuteron are of 2-nd or higher order (due to the relatively large nucleon\ndistace in the deuteron) The application of the model (3) to the exact representation of the total\nmagnetic moment of tritium, helium and other nuclei is straightforward and\nstudied in a future work Note that, the mutation of the charge distribution of the nucleons is not\na universal constant, because it depends on the local conditions, thus being\ngenerally different for different nuclei This illustrates the need of having\ninfinitely possible different isounits I [ˆ] ### 5 The basic principle for possible new recycling of nuclear waste\n\n\nRHM in its nuclear realization [1c] and the fundamental iso-Poincar´e symmetry [4c-4f] predict the possible mutation not only of the intrinsic magnetic\nmoment of the neutron, but also of its meanlife, to such an extent that the\nformer implies the latter and vice versa (as one can see via the use of the\nisoboosts) In turn, the control of the meanlife of the neutron de facto implies\nnew means for recycling the nuclear waste 10\n\n\nIn this respect, the first physical reality which should be noted and admitted is that total nuclear magnetic moments constitute experimental evidence\non the alterability of the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons The second physical reality which should be noted and admitted is that,\nby no means, the neutron has a constant and universal meanlife, because\nit possesses a meanlife of the order of seconds when belonging to certain\nnuclei with rapid beta decays, a meanlife of the order of 15 minutes when in\nvacuum, a meanlife of the order of days, weeks and years when belonging to\nother nuclei, all the way to an infinite meanlife for stable nuclei Once the above occurrences are admitted, basic principle for possible new\nrecycling of nuclear waste is the “stimulated neutron decay” (SND) consisting of resonating or other subnuclear mechanisms suitable to stimulate its\nbeta decay Among the various possibilities under study, we quote here the\npossible gamma stimulated neutron decay (GSND) according to the reaction\n\n[7b]\n\n\nγ + n → p [+] + e [−] + ¯ν, (5)\n\n\nwhich is predicted by RQM to have a very small (and therefore practically\ninsignificant) cross section as a function of the energy, but which is instead\npredicted by RHM to have a resonating peak in said cross section at the value\nof 1 294 MeV (corresponding to 3 129 × 10 [20] Hz) As such, the above mechanism is of subnuclear character, in the sense of occurring in the structure\nof the neutron, rather than in the nuclear structure, the latter merely implying possible refinements of the resonating frequency due to the (relatively\nsmaller) nuclear binding energy [7b] When stable elements are considered, the above GSND is admitted only\nin certain instances, evidently when the transition is compatible with all\nconventional laws This is the case for the isotope Mo(100,42) which, under\nthe GSND, would transform via beta emission into the Te(100,43) which, in\nturn, is naturally unstable and beta decays into Ru(100,44) For a number\nof additional admissible elements see [7b] The point important for this note is that the GSND is predicted to be\nadmissible for large and unstable nuclei as occurring in the nuclear waste The possible new form of recycling submitted for study in this note is given\nby bombarding the radioactive waste with a beam of photons of the needed\nexcitation frequency and of the maximal possible intensity Such a beam\n\n\n11\n\n\nwould cause an instantaneous excess of peripheral protons in the waste nuclei with their consequential decay due to instantaneous excess of Coulomb\nrepulsive forces It should be stressed that this note can only address the basic principle of\nthe GSND Once experimentally established (see next section), the recycling\nrequires evident additional technological studies on the equipment suitable\nto produce the photon beam in the desired frequency and intensity, eg , via\nsynchrotron radiation or other mechanisms [7e] The important point is that equipment of the above nature is expected to\nbe definitely smaller in size, weight and cost than large particle accelerators As such, the recycling is expected to verify the basic requirement of usability\nby the nuclear power companies in their own plants A novelty of this note is that the study of recycling mechanisms is specifically restricted to the subnuclear level A virtually endless number of possibilities exist for the reduction of the meanlife of the waste via mechanisms\n\nof nuclear type Among them we note mechanisms based on RQM, such\nas those by Shaffer et al [8a], Marriot et al [8b], Barker [8c] and others,\nas well as new nuclear mechanisms predicted by RHM and currently under\nadditional patenting The understanding is that, to maximize the efficiency,\nthe final equipment is expected to be a combination of various means of both\nsubnuclear and nuclear character As a final comment, the reader should be aware that any new recycling\nof nuclear waste is unavoidably linked to possible new sources of energy In\nfact, the GSND γ res + Mo(100, 42) [stim] → Tc(100, 43) + β spont → Ru(100, 44) + β\nis de facto a potential new source of subnuclear energy (releasing the rather\nlarge amount of about 5 MeV plus the energy of the γ res per nucleus) called\nhadronic energy [7b-7g] It should be noted that, it confirmed, the new energy\nwould not release harmful radiations, would not imply radioactive waste,\nwould not require heavy shield or critical mass, and would be realizable in\nlarge or minuterized forms, thus having ample prerequisites for additional\nstudies ### 6 Needed basic experiments\n\n\nThe continuation of quantitative scientific studies on the proposed new recycling of the nuclear waste (as well as on possible subnuclear forms of clean\n\n\n12\n\n\nenergy) beyond the level of personal views one way or another, requires the\nfollowing three basic experiments, all of moderate cost and fully realizable\nwith current technology 1 Finalize the interferometric 4π spinorial symmetry measures\n\n[9] Preliminary direct experimental measures on the alterability of the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons were conducted from 1975 to 1979 by\nH Rauch and his associates [9a-9e] via interferometic measures of the 4π\nspinorial symmetry of the neutron The best available measures [9e] dating\nback to 1979 indicate about 1% deviations from 720 [◦] But such deviation\nis smaller than the error, and the measures are therefore undefined Similar\nunsettled measures were conducted by Werner and his associates [9f] in the\nmid 1970’s The above measures are manifestly fundamental for possible new forms\nof recycling as well as for possible new forms of subnuclear energy In fact,\nthey would provide experimental evidence on possible deviations from the\nPoincar´e symmetry in favor of our covering iso-Poincar´e form [4] This is\ndue to the fact that, if confirmed, the measures would establish a deviation\nfrom the fundamental spinorial transformation law of favor of the mutated\nform easily derivable from Eqs (1) (first identified in [6], see [1c] for a recent\nderivation)\n\n\nˆ [θ][ˆ] [3] [/][2] ˆ\nψ [′] = ˆR(θ 3 )ˆ×ψ ˆ = e [iγ] [1] [γ] [2] × ˆψ, θ = θ/n 1 × n 2, (6)\n\n\nAs an illustration, assume a 1% deviation from 720 [◦] The isotopies reconstruct the exact SU(2)-spin in isospace, thus requiring θ [ˆ] = θ/n 1 × n 2 =\n720 [◦] [4h] This yields\n\n\n2 2 ◦ ◦ 2\nn 1 = n 2 = 713 /720 = 0 990, n 3 = 1 020, (7a)\n\n\nˆ\nµ/µ = n 4 /n 3 ≈ 713 [◦] /720 [◦], n 4 = n 3 × 713 [◦] /714 [◦] = 1 000, (7b)\n\n\nnamely, our iso-Dirac equation provides an exact-numerical representation of\nthe 4π interferometric measures, by deriving the value n 4 = 1 occurring in\nvacuum, as it is the case for the neutrons of tests [9] (but only approximately\nso for the deuteron) For more details see [1c] Once, in addition to the evidence from total nuclear magnetic moments\nand various other applications [4,5], the validity of the iso-Poincar´e symme\n\n13\n\n\ntry is established via direct experiments for the mutation of the intrinsic\nmagnetic moment of the neutron, that of its meanlife is expected to be consequential 2 Repeat don Borghi’s experiment [7f] on the apparent synthesis of the neutron from protons and electrons only Despite momentous advances, we still miss fundamental experimental knowledge on the\nstructure of the neutron, e",
    "Despite momentous advances, we still miss fundamental experimental knowledge on the\nstructure of the neutron, e g g , on how the neutron is synthesized from protons\nand electrons only in young stars solely composed of hydrogen (where quark\nmodels cannot be used owing to the lack of the remaining members of the\nbaryonic octet, and weak interactions do not provide sufficient information\non the structure problem) The synthesis occurs according to the reaction p [+] + e [−] → n + ν which:\nis the “inverse” of the stimulated decay (5); is predicted by RQM to have\na very small cross section as a function of the energy; while the same cross\nsection is predicted by RHM to have a peak at the threshold energy of 0 80\nMeV in singlet p-e coupling [4f] The possible synthesis of the neutron has a fundamental relevance for\nwaste recycling, besides other industrial applications If the electron “disappears” at the creation of the neutron as in current theoretical views, the\nGSND becomes of difficult if not impossible realization However, the electron is a permanent and stable particle As such, doubts\nas to whether it can “disappear” date back to Rutherford’s very conception\nof the neutron as a “compressed hydrogen atom” [7a] As well known, RQM\ndoes not permit such a representation of the neutron structure on numerous counts Nevertheless, the covering RHM has indeed achieved an exactnumerical representation of all characteristics of the neutron according to\nRutherford’s original conception [4f] The novelty is that, when immersed\n\nˆ\nwithin the hyperdense proton, the electron experiences a mutation e [−] → e [−]\n\nof its intrinsic characteristics (becoming a quark ) including its rest energy (because n 4 ̸= 1 inside the proton, thus E eˆ = mc [2] + m e c 0 [2] /n 4 [2] ) The\nexcitation energy of 1 294 MeV is predicted by our covering iso-Poincar´e\nsymmetry under the condition of recovering all characteristics of the neutron for the model n = (p [+] ↑ [,][ ˆ][e] [−] ↓ [)] [RHM] [,][ including its primary decay for which]\n\nˆ\ne [−] → e [−] + ¯ν [4f] A preliminary experimental verification of the synthesize the neutron in\nlaboratory was done by don Borghi’s and his associates [7d] Since experi\n\n14\n\n\nments can be confirmed or dismissed solely via other experiments and certainly not via theoretical beliefs one way or the other, don Borghi’s experiment must be run again The test can be repeated either as originally done\n\n[7f], or in a number of alternative ways, e g , by hitting with a cathodic ray of\n0 80 MeV a mass of beryllium saturated with hydrogen, put at low temperature and subjected to an intense electric field to maximize the p-e singlet\ncoupling The detection of neutrons emanating from such a set-up would\nestablish their synthesis 3 Complete Tsagas’ experiment [7g] on the stimulated neutron\ndecay The last and most fundamental information needed for additional\nquantitative studies is the verification or disproof of the GSND at the resonating gamma frequency of 1",
    "The last and most fundamental information needed for additional\nquantitative studies is the verification or disproof of the GSND at the resonating gamma frequency of 1 294 MeV 294 MeV The latter experiment has been initiated by N Tsagas and his associates\n\n[7g] It consists of a disk of the radioisotope Eu [152] (emitting gammas of\n1 3 MeV) placed parallel and close to a disk of an element admitting of the\nGSND, such as the Mo(100,42) (or a sample of nuclear waste) The detection\nof electrons with at least 2 MeV emanating from the system would establish\nthe principle of the GSND (because such electrons can only be of subnuclear origin, Compton electrons being of at most 1 MeV) The detection via\nmass spectrography of traces of the extremely rare Ru(100,44) after sufficient running time would confirm said principle The practical realization of\nthe proposed form of waste recycling would then be shifted to the industrial\ndevelopment and production of a photon beam of the needed frequency and\nintensity ### References\n\n\n[1] U S Department of Energy, Baseline Environmental Management Report, U S Printing Office, Virginia (1995) [1a]; C D Bowman, Los\nAlamos Report (1995) [1b]; R M Santilli, “Application of hadronic\nmechanics to an exact representation of the magnetic moment of the\ndeuteron”, submitted to Journal of Physics G [1c] [2] J M Blatt and V F Weisskopf, Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Wiley &\nSons (1964) [2a]; S G Bondarenko, et al , JINR Communication E4-95440 (1995), Dubna, Russia [2b] 15\n\n\n[3] C N Ktorides, H C Myung and R M Santilli, Phys Rev D 22, 892\n(1980) [3a]; Foundations of Theoretical Mechanics, Vols I (1978), II\n(1983), Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg-New York [3b]; R M Santilli, ”Relativistic hadronic mechanics: nonunitary, axiom-preserving completion of\nrelativistic quantum mechanics”, submitted to Journal of Physics G [3c]",
