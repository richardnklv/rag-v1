    "## Einstein’s Violation of General Covariance\n\nKenneth Dalton\n\n\nemail: kxdalton@yahoo.com\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEinstein rejected the differential law of energy-momentum conservation\nT ; [µν] ν [= 0. In doing so, he violated the principle of general covariance. Here,]\nwe prove the conservation law T ; [µν] ν = 0 and discuss its significance for\ngeneral relativity.\n\n\n1\n\n\nIn his founding paper on general relativity, Einstein stated the principle\nof general covariance:\n\n\n“The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations which hold good for all systems of coordinates, that is, are\ncovariant with respect to any substitutions whatever (generally\ncovariant).” [1]\n\n\nIn that same paper, he rejected the differential law of energy-momentum\nconservation\n\n\n1 ∂ [√] −g T [µν]\nT ; [µν] ν [=] √−g ∂x [ν] + Γ [µ] νλ [T] [ νλ] [ = 0] (1)\n\n\nHe writes as follows: the term Γ [µ]\nνλ [T] [ νλ] [ “shows that laws of conservation of]\nmomentum and energy do not apply in the strict sense for matter alone.”[2]\nThis statement constitutes a direct violation of general covariance. All textbook authors to date have followed Einstein’s erroneous lead in this matter.\n\nHere are two exceptionally forthright quotations:\n\n\n(a) the equations T ; [µν] ν [= 0 “are not what can properly be called conserva-]\ntion laws” [3];\n\n\n(b) the equation T ; [µν] ν = 0 “does not generally express any conservation\nlaw whatever.” [4]\n\n\nIt is not difficult to prove the conservation law (1). In flat rectangular coordinates x [µ] = (x [0], x, y, z) conservation is expressed by the Lorentz\ncovariant equation\n\n\n∂T [µν]\n\n= 0 (2)\n∂x [ν]\n\n\nSuppose, instead, that we choose ordinary flat spherical coordinates x [µ][′] =\n(x [0], r, θ, φ). What will be the correct equation in the new coordinate system?\nTo answer this question, we begin with equation (2) and substitute the\ntransformed quantities\n\n\n\n\n[∂x] [µ] ∂x [ν]\n\n∂x [α][′] ∂x [β]\n\n\n\nT [µν] = [∂x] [µ]\n\n\n\n(3)\n∂x [β] [′] [ T] [ αβ] [′]\n\n\n\n∂ ∂\n\n(4)\n\n∂x [ν] [ =][ ∂x] ∂x [γ][ν][′] ∂x [γ] [′]\n\n\n2\n\n\nWe then make use of\n\n\n\n\n[∂x] [µ][′] ∂x [β]\n\n∂x [α] ∂x [ν]\n\n\n\n∂x [γ]\n\n∂x [λ][′] [ Γ] βγ [α] [+][ ∂x] ∂x [µ][α][′]\n\n\n\n′\nΓ [µ] = [∂x] [µ][′]\nνλ\n\n\n\n∂x ∂x [γ]\n\n\n∂x [ν] [′] ∂x [λ]\n\n\n\n(5)\n∂x [ν] [′] ∂x [λ][′]\n\n\n\n\n[µ][′] ∂ [2] x [α]\n\n∂x [α] ∂x [ν] [′]\n\n\n\n1 ∂ [√] −g [′] ′\n\n= Γ [α] αν (6)\n\n√−g ′ ∂x [ν] [′]\n\n\n\nand arrive at the equation\n\n\n1 ∂ [√] −g [′] T [µν] [′] ′\n√−g ′ ∂x [ν] [′] + Γ [µ] νλ T νλ [′] = 0 (7)\n\n\nThis proves the differential law of energy-momentum conservation in the\nspherical coordinate system. Because this law is generally covariant, it must\nhold true for all systems of coordinates, flat or curved (principle of general\ncovariance).\nThe equation T ; [µν] ν = 0 is not open to interpretation, any more than\nMaxwell’s equations are open to interpretation. They are generally covariant laws of nature, all of which belong to four-dimensional tensor analysis.\nThese laws are beyond personal choice; it is this fact which demonstrates the\npower of general covariance. To reject such an equation is simply to make\na mistake. Einstein made such a mistake in rejecting the law of energymomentum conservation T ; [µν] ν [= 0][.]\nThis law has profound physical consequences for general relativity. The\ngravitational field equations are\n\n\nR [µν] − [1] (8)\n\n2 [g] [µν] [R][ =][ −][κ T] [ µν]\n\n\nT [µν] is the stress-energy-momentum tensor of matter and electromagnetism.\nThe covariant divergence of the left-hand side is identically zero, therefore\n\n\nT ; [µν] ν [= 0] (9)\n\n\nThis equation means that the energy-momentum of matter and electromagnetism is conserved, at all space-time points. In other words, there is no\nexchange of energy-momentum with the gravitational field. Conclusion:\nEinstein’s gravitational field has no energy, momentum, or stress [5, 6].\n\n\n3\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. A.
