SONS\nLondon, Edinburgh, Dublin, and New York\n\n\nPREFACE THOMAS NELSON AND SONS\nLondon, Edinburgh, Dublin, and New York\n\n\nPREFACE How does it work This question has been put to me so often by\npersons young and old that I have at last decided to answer it in such\na manner that a much larger public than that with which I have\npersonal acquaintance may be able to satisfy themselves as to the\nprinciples underlying many of the mechanisms met with in everyday\nlife In order to include steam, electricity, optics, hydraulics, thermics,\nlight, and a variety of detached mechanisms which cannot be\nclassified under any one of these heads, within the compass of about\n450 pages, I have to be content with a comparatively brief treatment\nof each subject This brevity has in turn compelled me to deal with\nprinciples rather than with detailed descriptions of individual devices\n—though in several cases recognized types are examined The reader\nwill look in vain for accounts of the Yerkes telescope, of the latest\nthing in motor cars, and of the largest locomotive But he will be put\nin the way of understanding the essential nature of all telescopes,\nmotors, and steam-engines so far as they are at present developed,\nwhich I think may be of greater ultimate profit to the uninitiated While careful to avoid puzzling the reader by the use of mysterious\nphraseology I consider that the parts of a machine should be given\ntheir technical names wherever possible To prevent misconception,\nmany of the diagrams accompanying the letterpress have words as\nwell as letters written on them This course also obviates the\nwearisome reference from text to diagram necessitated by the use of\nsolitary letters or figures I may add, with regard to the diagrams of this book, that they are\npurposely somewhat unconventional, not being drawn to scale nor\nconforming to the canons of professional draughtsmanship Where\nadvisable, a part of a machine has been exaggerated to show its\n\n\ndetails As a rule solid black has been preferred to fine shading in\nsectional drawings, and all unnecessary lines are omitted I would\nhere acknowledge my indebtedness to my draughtsman, Mr Frank\nHodgson, for his care and industry in preparing the two hundred or\nmore diagrams for which he was responsible Four organs of the body—the eye, the ear, the larynx, and the heart\n—are noticed in appropriate places The eye is compared with the\ncamera, the larynx with a reed pipe, the heart with a pump, while the\near fitly opens the chapter on acoustics The reader who is\nunacquainted with physiology will thus be enabled to appreciate the\nbetter these marvellous devices, far more marvellous, by reason of\ntheir absolutely automatic action,

types of\nboilers—Aids to combustion—Boiler fittings—The safety-\nvalve—The \nwater-gauge—The \nsteam-gauge—The \nwater\nsupply to a boiler WHAT IS STEAM If ice be heated above 32° Fahrenheit, its molecules lose their\ncohesion, and move freely round one another—the ice is turned into\nwater Heat water above 212° Fahrenheit, and the molecules exhibit a\nviolent mutual repulsion, and, like dormant bees revived by spring\nsunshine, separate and dart to and fro If confined in an air-tight\nvessel, the molecules have their flights curtailed, and beat more and\nmore violently against their prison walls, so that every square inch of\nthe vessel is subjected to a rising pressure We may compare the\naction of the steam molecules to that of bullets fired from a machine-\ngun at a plate mounted on a spring The faster the bullets came, the\ngreater would be the continuous compression of the spring THE MECHANICAL ENERGY OF STEAM If steam is let into one end of a cylinder behind an air-tight but\nfreely-moving piston, it will bombard the walls of the cylinder and the\npiston; and if the united push of the molecules on the one side of the\nlatter is greater than the resistance on the other side opposing its\nmotion, the piston must move Having thus partly got their liberty,\n\n\nthe molecules become less active, and do not rush about so\nvigorously The pressure on the piston decreases as it moves But if\nthe piston were driven back to its original position against the force of\nthe steam, the molecular activity—that is, pressure—would be\nrestored We are here assuming that no heat has passed through the\ncylinder or piston and been radiated into the air; for any loss of heat\nmeans loss of energy, since heat is energy THE BOILER The combustion of fuel in a furnace causes the walls of the furnace\nto become hot, which means that the molecules of the substance\nforming the walls are thrown into violent agitation If the walls are\nwhat are called \"good conductors\" of heat, they will transmit the\nagitation through them to any surrounding substance In the case of\nthe ordinary house stove this is the air, which itself is agitated, or\ngrows warm A steam-boiler has the furnace walls surrounded by\nwater, and its function is to transmit molecular movement (heat, or\nenergy) through the furnace plates to the water until the point is\nreached when steam generates At atmospheric pressure—that is, if\nnot confined in any way—steam would fill 1,610 times the space\nwhich its molecules occupied in their watery formation If we seal up\nthe boiler so that no escape is possible for the steam molecules, their\nmotion becomes more and more rapid, and pressure is developed by\ntheir beating on the walls of the boiler There is theoretically no limit\nto which the pressure may be raised, provided that sufficient fuel-\ncombustion energy is transmitted to the vaporizing water To raise steam in large quantities we must employ a fuel which\ndevelops great heat in proportion to its weight, is readily procured,\nand cheap Coal fulfils all these conditions Of the 800 million tons\nmined annually throughout the world, 400 million tons are burnt in\nthe furnaces of steam-boilers A good boiler must be—(1) Strong enough to withstand much\nhigher pressures than that at which it is worked; (2) so designed as to\nburn its fuel to the greatest advantage Even in the best-designed boilers a large part of the combustion\n\n\nheat passes through the chimney, while a further proportion is\nradiated from the boiler",
    "Even in the best-designed boilers a large part of the combustion\n\n\nheat passes through the chimney, while a further proportion is\nradiated from the boiler Professor John Perry[1] considers that this\nwaste amounts, under the best conditions at present obtainable, to\neleven-twelfths of the whole We have to burn a shillingsworth of coal\nto capture the energy stored in a pennyworth Yet the steam-engine of\nto-day is three or four times as efficient as the engine of fifty years\nago This is due to radical improvements in the design of boilers and\nof the machinery which converts the heat energy of steam into\nmechanical motion CIRCULATION OF WATER IN A BOILER If you place a pot filled with water on an open fire, and watch it\nwhen it boils, you will notice that the water heaves up at the sides\nand plunges down at the centre This is due to the water being heated\nmost at the sides, and therefore being lightest there The rising steam-\nbubbles also carry it up On reaching the surface, the bubbles burst,\nthe steam escapes, and the water loses some of its heat, and rushes\ndown again to take the place of steam-laden water rising On reaching the surface, the bubbles burst,\nthe steam escapes, and the water loses some of its heat, and rushes\ndown again to take the place of steam-laden water rising Fig 1 Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 2 If the fire is very fierce, steam-bubbles may rise from all points at\nthe bottom, and impede downward currents (Fig 1) The pot then\n\"boils over \"\nFig",
    "\"\nFig 2 shows a method of preventing this trouble We lower into\nour pot a vessel of somewhat smaller diameter, with a hole in the\nbottom, arranged in such a manner as to leave a space between it and\nthe pot all round The upward currents are then separated entirely\nfrom the downward, and the fire can be forced to a very much greater\nextent than before without the water boiling over This very simple\narrangement is the basis of many devices for producing free\ncirculation of the water in steam-boilers We can easily follow out the process of development In Fig 3 we\nsee a simple U-tube depending from a vessel of water Heat is applied\nto the left leg, and a steady circulation at once commences In order to\n\n\nincrease the heating surface we can extend the heated leg into a long\nincline (Fig 4), beneath which three lamps instead of only one are\nplaced The direction of the circulation is the same, but its rate is\nincreased The direction of the circulation is the same, but its rate is\nincreased Fig 3 Fig 3 A further improvement results from increasing the number of tubes\n(Fig 5), keeping them all on the slant, so that the heated water and\nsteam may rise freely THE ENCLOSED FURNACE Fig 4 Fig 4 Fig 5 Fig 5 Still, a lot of the heat gets away In a steam-boiler the burning fuel\nis enclosed either by fire-brick or a \"water-jacket,\" forming part of the\nboiler A water-jacket signifies a double coating of metal plates with a\nspace between, which is filled with water (see Fig",
    "A water-jacket signifies a double coating of metal plates with a\nspace between, which is filled with water (see Fig 6) The fire is now\nenclosed much as it is in a kitchen range But our boiler must not be\nso wasteful of the heat as is that useful household fixture On their\nway to the funnel the flames and hot gases should act on a very large\nmetal or other surface in contact with the water of the boiler, in order\nto give up a due proportion of their heat On their\nway to the funnel the flames and hot gases should act on a very large\nmetal or other surface in contact with the water of the boiler, in order\nto give up a due proportion of their heat Fig 6 Fig 6 —Diagrammatic sketch of a locomotive type of boiler Water in\nthe direction taken by the air and hot gases from th\nTHE MULTITUBULAR BOILER Water in\nthe direction taken by the air and hot gases from th\nTHE MULTITUBULAR BOILER Fig 7 Fig 7 —The Babcock and Wilcox water-tube boiler One side of the br\n\n\nseating has been removed to show the arrangement of the water-tubes\nfurnace To save room, boilers which have to make steam very quickly and\nat high pressures are largely composed of pipes Such boilers we call\nmultitubular They are of two kinds—(1) Water-tube boilers; in which\nthe water circulates through tubes exposed to the furnace heat The\nBabcock and Wilcox boiler (Fig 7) is typical of this variety",
    "7) is typical of this variety (2) Fire-\ntube boilers; in which the hot gases pass through tubes surrounded by\nwater The ordinary locomotive boiler (Fig 6) illustrates this form The Babcock and Wilcox boiler is widely used in mines, power\nstations, and, in a modified form, on shipboard It consists of two\nmain parts—(1) A drum, H, in the upper part of which the steam\ncollects; (2) a group of pipes arranged on the principle illustrated by\nFig 5 The boiler is seated on a rectangular frame of fire-bricks At\none end is the furnace door; at the other the exit to the chimney From the furnace F the flames and hot gases rise round the upper end\nof the sloping tubes TT into the space A, where they play upon the\nunder surface of H before plunging downward again among the tubes\ninto the space B Here the temperature is lower The arrows indicate\nfurther journeys upwards into the space C on the right of a fire-brick\ndivision, and past the down tubes SS into D, whence the hot gases find\nan escape into the chimney through the opening E It will be noticed\nthat the greatest heat is brought to bear on TT near their junction\nwith UU, the \"uptake\" tubes; and that every succeeding passage of the\npipes brings the gradually cooling gases nearer to the \"downtake\"\ntubes SS The pipes TT are easily brushed and scraped after the removal of\nplugs from the \"headers\" into which the tube ends are expanded Other well-known water-tube boilers are the Yarrow, Belleville,\nStirling, and Thorneycroft, all used for driving marine engines FIRE-TUBE BOILERS Fig 6 shows a locomotive boiler in section To the right is the fire-\n\n\nbox, surrounded on all sides by a water-jacket in direct\ncommunication with the barrel of the boiler The inner shell of the\nfire-box is often made of copper, which withstands the fierce heat\nbetter than steel; the outer, like the rest of the boiler, is of steel plates\nfrom ½ to ¾ inch thick The shells of the jacket are braced together\nby a large number of rivets, RR; and the top, or crown, is\nstrengthened by heavy longitudinal girders riveted to it, or is braced\nto the top of the boiler by long bolts A large number of fire-tubes\n(only three are shown in the diagram for the sake of simplicity)\nextend from the fire-box to the smoke-box The most powerful\n\"mammoth\" American locomotives have 350 or more tubes, which,\nwith the fire-box, give 4,000 square feet of surface for the furnace\nheat to act upon These tubes are expanded at their ends by a special\ntool into the tube-plates of the fire-box and boiler front George\nStephenson and his predecessors experienced great difficulty in\nrendering the tube-end joints quite water-tight, but the invention of\nthe \"expander\" has removed this trouble The fire-brick arch shown (Fig 6) in the fire-box is used to deflect\nthe flames towards the back of the fire-box, so that the hot gases may\nbe retarded somewhat, and their combustion rendered more perfect It\nalso helps to distribute the heat more evenly over the whole of the\ninside of the box, and prevents cold air from flying directly from the\nfiring door to the tubes In some American and Continental\nlocomotives the fire-brick arch is replaced by a \"water bridge,\" which\nserves the same purpose, while giving additional heating surface The water circulation in a locomotive boiler is—upwards at the\nfire-box end, where the heat is most intense; forward along the\nsurface; downwards at the smoke-box end; backwards along the\nbottom of the barrel OTHER TYPES OF BOILERS For small stationary land engines the vertical boiler is much used",
    "For small stationary land engines the vertical boiler is much used In Fig 8 we have three forms of this type—A and B with cross water-\ntubes; C with vertical fire-tubes The furnace in every case is\nsurrounded by water, and fed through a door at one side Fig 8 Fig 8 —Diagrammatic representation of three types of vert\nThe Lancashire boiler is of large size It has a cylindrical shell,\nmeasuring up to 30 feet in length and 7 feet in diameter, traversed\nfrom end to end by two large flues, in the rear part of which are\nsituated the furnaces The boiler is fixed on a seating of fire-bricks, so\nbuilt up as to form three flues, A and BB, shown in cross section in\nFig 9 The furnace gases, after leaving the two furnace flues, are\ndeflected downwards into the channel A, by which they pass\nunderneath the boiler to a point almost under the furnace, where they\ndivide right and left and travel through cross passages into the side\nchannels BB, to be led along the boiler's flanks to the chimney exit C By this arrangement the effective heating surface is greatly increased;\nand the passages being large, natural draught generally suffices to\nmaintain proper combustion The Lancashire boiler is much used in\nfactories and (in a modified form) on ships, since it is a steady\nsteamer and is easily kept in order Fig 9 Fig 9 —Cross and longitudinal sections of a Lancashire\nIn marine boilers of cylindrical shape cross water-tubes and fire-\ntubes are often employed to increase the heating surface Return tubes\nare also led through the water to the funnels, situated at the same end\nas the furnace AIDS TO COMBUSTION We may now turn our attention more particularly to the chemical\nprocess called combustion, upon which a boiler depends for its heat Ordinary steam coal contains about 85 per cent of carbon, 7 per cent of oxygen, and 4 per cent of hydrogen, besides traces of nitrogen and\nsulphur and a small incombustible residue When the coal burns, the\nnitrogen is released and passes away without combining with any of\nthe other elements The sulphur unites with hydrogen and forms\nsulphuretted hydrogen (also named sulphurous acid), which is\ninjurious to steel plates, and is largely responsible for the decay of\ntubes and funnels More of the hydrogen unites with the oxygen as\n\n\nsteam The most important element in coal is the carbon (known\nchemically by the symbol C) Its combination with oxygen, called\ncombustion, is the act which heats the boiler Only when the carbon\npresent has combined with the greatest possible amount of oxygen\nthat it will take into partnership is the combustion complete and the\nfull heat-value (fixed by scientific experiment at 14,500 thermal units\nper pound of carbon) developed Now, carbon may unite with oxygen, atom for atom, and form\ncarbon monoxide (CO); or in the proportion of one atom of carbon to\ntwo of oxygen, and form carbon dioxide (CO2) The former gas is\ncombustible—that is, will admit another atom of carbon to the\nmolecule—but the latter is saturated with oxygen, and will not burn,\nor, to put it otherwise, is the product of perfect combustion A\nproperly designed furnace, supplied with a due amount of air, will\ncause nearly all the carbon in the coal burnt to combine with the full\namount of oxygen On the other hand, if the oxygen supply is\ninefficient, CO as well as CO2 will form, and there will be a heat loss,\nequal in extreme cases to two-thirds of the whole It is therefore\nnecessary that a furnace which has to eat up fuel at a great pace\nshould be artificially fed with air in the proportion of from 12 to 20\npounds of air for every pound of fuel There are two methods of\ncreating a violent draught through the furnace The first is—\nThe forced draught; very simply exemplified by the ordinary bellows\nused in every house On a ship (Fig 10) the principle is developed as\nfollows:—The boilers are situated in a compartment or compartments\nhaving no communication with the outer air, except for the passages\ndown which air is forced by powerful fans at a pressure considerably\ngreater than that of the atmosphere There is only one \"way out\"—\nnamely, through the furnace and tubes (or gas-ways) of the boiler,\nand the funnel So through these it rushes, raising the fuel to white\nheat As may easily be imagined, the temperature of a stokehold,\nespecially in the tropics, is far from pleasant In the Red Sea the\nthermometer sometimes rises to 170° Fahrenheit or more, and the\npoor stokers have a very bad time of it Fig 10 Fig 10 —Sketch showing how the \"forced draught\" is produced in a \naffects the furnaces SCENE IN THE STOKEHOLD OF A BATTLE-SHIP\nSCENE IN THE STOKEHOLD OF A BATTLE-SHI\nThe second system is that of the induced draught Here air is sucked\nthrough the furnace by creating a vacuum in the funnel and in a\nchamber opening into it Turning to Fig",
    "Turning to Fig 6, we see a pipe through\nwhich the exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders is shot\nupwards into the funnel, in which, and in the smoke-box beneath it, a\nstrong vacuum is formed while the engine is running Now, \"nature\nabhors a vacuum,\" so air will get into the smoke-box if there be a way\nopen There is—through the air-doors at the bottom of the furnace,\nthe furnace itself, and the fire-tubes; and on the way oxygen combines\nwith the carbon of the fuel, to form carbon dioxide The power of the\ndraught is so great that, as one often notices when a train passes\nduring the night, red-hot cinders, plucked from the fire-box, and\ndragged through the tubes, are hurled far into the air It might be\nmentioned in parenthesis that the so-called \"smoke\" which pours from\nthe funnel of a moving engine is mainly condensing steam A\nsteamship, on the other hand, belches smoke only from its funnels, as\nfresh water is far too precious to waste as steam We shall refer to this\nlater on (p 72) BOILER FITTINGS The most important fittings on a boiler are:—(1) the safety-valve;\n(2) the water-gauge; (3) the steam-gauge; (4) the mechanisms for\nfeeding it with water THE SAFETY-VALVE Professor Thurston, an eminent authority on the steam-engine, has\n\n\nestimated that a plain cylindrical boiler carrying 100 lbs pressure to\nthe square inch contains sufficient stored energy to project it into the\nair a vertical distance of 3½ miles In the case of a Lancashire boiler\nat equal pressure the distance would be 2½ miles; of a locomotive\nboiler, at 125 lbs , 1½ miles; of a steam tubular boiler, at 75 lbs , 1\nmile According to the same writer, a cubic foot of heated water under\na pressure of from 60 to 70 lbs per square inch has about the same\nenergy as one pound of gunpowder Steam is a good servant, but a terrible master It must be kept\nunder strict control However strong a boiler may be, it will burst if\nthe steam pressure in it be raised to a certain point; and some device\nmust therefore be fitted on it which will give the steam free egress\nbefore that point is reached A device of this kind is called a safety-\nvalve It usually blows off at less than half the greatest pressure that\nthe boiler has been proved by experiment to be capable of\nwithstanding In principle the safety-valve denotes an orifice closed by an\naccurately-fitting plug, which is pressed against its seat on the boiler\ntop by a weighted lever, or by a spring As soon as the steam pressure\non the face of the plug exceeds the counteracting force of the weight\nor spring, the plug rises, and steam escapes until equilibrium of the\nopposing forces is restored On stationary engines a lever safety-valve is commonly employed\n(Fig 11)",
    "11) The blowing-off point can be varied by shifting the weight\nalong the arm so as to give it a greater or less leverage On locomotive\nand marine boilers, where shocks and movements have to be reckoned\nwith, weights are replaced by springs, set to a certain tension, and\nlocked up so that they cannot be tampered with Fig 11 Fig 11 —A Lever Safety-Valve V, valve; S, seating; P, pin; L, lever; F, f\nfigures indicate the positions at which the weight should be placed fo\nthe pressure rises to that number of pounds per squar\nBoilers are tested by filling the boilers quite full and (1) by heating\nthe water, which expands slightly, but with great pressure; (2) by\n\n\nforcing in additional water with a powerful pump In either case a\nrupture would not be attended by an explosion, as water is very\ninelastic The days when an engineer could \"sit on the valves\"—that is, screw\nthem down—to obtain greater pressure, are now past, and with them\na considerable proportion of the dangers of high-pressure steam The\nFactory Act of 1895, in force throughout the British Isles, provides\nthat every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop where\nthe Act applies must have a proper safety-valve, steam-gauge, and\nwater-gauge; and that boilers and fittings must be examined by a\ncompetent person at least once in every fourteen months Neglect of\nthese provisions renders the owner of a boiler liable to heavy\npenalties if an explosion occurs One of the most disastrous explosions on record took place at the\nRedcar Iron Works, Yorkshire, in June 1895 In this case, twelve out\nof fifteen boilers ranged side by side burst, through one proving too\nweak for its work The flying fragments of this boiler, striking the\nsides of other boilers, exploded them, and so the damage was\ntransmitted down the line Twenty men were killed and injured; while\nmasses of metal, weighing several tons each, were hurled 250 yards,\nand caused widespread damage",
    "Twenty men were killed and injured; while\nmasses of metal, weighing several tons each, were hurled 250 yards,\nand caused widespread damage The following is taken from a journal, dated December 22, 1895:\n\"Providence (Rhode Island) —A recent prophecy that a boiler would\nexplode between December 16 and 24 in a store has seriously affected\nthe Christmas trade Shoppers are incredibly nervous One store\nadvertises, 'No boilers are being used; lifts running electrically ' All\nstores have had their boilers inspected \"\nTHE WATER-GAUGE No fitting of a boiler is more important than the water-gauge, which\nshows the level at which the water stands The engineer must\ncontinually consult his gauge, for if the water gets too low, pipes and\nother surfaces exposed to the furnace flames may burn through, with\n\n\ndisastrous results; while, on the other hand, too much water will\ncause bad steaming A section of an ordinary gauge is seen in Fig 12 12 It consists of two parts, each furnished with a gland, G, to make a\nsteam-tight joint round the glass tube, which is inserted through the\nhole covered by the plug P1 The cocks T1 T2 are normally open,\nallowing the ingress of steam and water respectively to the tube Cock\nT3 is kept closed unless for any reason it is necessary to blow steam or\nwater through the gauge The holes C C can be cleaned out if the\nplugs P2 P3 are removed The holes C C can be cleaned out if the\nplugs P2 P3 are removed Fig 12 Fig 12 —Section of a water-gauge Most gauges on high-pressure boilers have a thick glass screen in\nfront, so that in the event of the tube breaking, the steam and water\nmay not blow directly on to the attendants A further precaution is to\ninclude two ball-valves near the ends of the gauge-glass Under\nordinary conditions the balls lie in depressions clear of the ways; but\nwhen a rush of steam or water occurs they are sucked into their\nseatings and block all egress On many boilers two water-gauges are fitted, since any gauge may\nwork badly at times The glasses are tested to a pressure of 3,000 lbs or more to the square inch before use THE STEAM-GAUGE It is of the utmost importance that a person in charge of a boiler\nshould know what pressure the steam has reached Every boiler is\ntherefore fitted with one steam-gauge; many with two, lest one might\nbe unreliable There are two principal types of steam-gauge:—(1) The\nBourdon; (2) the Schäffer-Budenberg The principle of the Bourdon is\nillustrated by Fig 13, in which A is a piece of rubber tubing closed at\none end, and at the other drawn over the nozzle of a cycle tyre\ninflator If bent in a curve, as shown, the section of the tube is an\noval When air is pumped in, the rubber walls endeavour to assume a\ncircular section, because this shape encloses a larger area than an oval\nof equal circumference, and therefore makes room for a larger volume\nof air In doing so the tube straightens itself, and assumes the position\n\n\nindicated by the dotted lines Hang an empty \"inner tube\" of a\npneumatic tyre over a nail and inflate it, and you will get a good\nillustration of the principle Fig 13 Fig 13 —Showing the principle of the steam-gaug\nFig 14 Fig 14 —Bourdon steam-gauge Part of dial removed to show\nIn Fig 14 we have a Bourdon gauge, with part of the dial face\nbroken away to show the internal mechanism T is a flattened metal\ntube soldered at one end into a hollow casting, into which screws a\ntap connected with the boiler The other end (closed) is attached to a\nlink, L, which works an arm of a quadrant rack, R, engaging with a\nsmall pinion, P, actuating the pointer As the steam pressure rises, the\ntube T moves its free end outwards towards the position shown by the\ndotted lines, and traverses the arm of the rack, so shifting the pointer\nround the scale As the pressure falls, the tube gradually returns to its\nzero position The Schäffer-Budenberg gauge depends for its action on the\nelasticity of a thin corrugated metal plate, on one side of which steam\npresses As the plate bulges upwards it pushes up a small rod resting\non it, which operates a quadrant and rack similar to that of the\nBourdon gauge The principle is employed in another form for the\naneroid barometer (p 329) THE WATER SUPPLY TO A BOILER The water inside a boiler is kept at a proper level by (1) pumps or\n(2) injectors The former are most commonly used on stationary and\nmarine boilers As their mechanism is much the same as that of\nordinary force pumps, which will be described in a later chapter, we\nmay pass at once to the injector, now almost universally used on\nlocomotive, and sometimes on stationary boilers At first sight the\ninjector is a mechanical paradox, since it employs the steam from a\nboiler to blow water into the boiler In Fig 15 we have an illustration\nof the principle of an injector Steam is led from the boiler through\npipe A, which terminates in a nozzle surrounded by a cone, E,\n\n\nconnected by the pipe B with the water tank When steam is turned on\nit rushes with immense velocity from the nozzle, and creates a partial\nvacuum in cone E, which soon fills with water On meeting the water\nthe steam condenses, but not before it has imparted some of its\nvelocity to the water, which thus gains sufficient momentum to force\ndown the valve and find its way to the boiler The overflow space O O\nbetween E and C allows steam and water to escape until the water has\ngathered the requisite momentum",

    "The linear motion of the piston rod is converted into rotatory motion\nby the connecting rod and crank Fig 22 Fig 22 —Perspective section of cylinder The use of a crank appears to be so obvious a method of producing\nthis conversion that it is interesting to learn that, when James Watt\nproduced his \"rotative engine\" in 1780 he was unable to use the crank\nbecause it had already been patented by one Matthew Wasborough Watt was not easily daunted, however, and within a twelvemonth had\nhimself patented five other devices for obtaining rotatory motion from\na piston rod Before passing on, it may be mentioned that Watt was\nthe father of the modern—that is, the high-pressure—steam-engine;\nand that, owing to the imperfection of the existing machinery, the\ndifficulties he had to overcome were enormous On one occasion he\ncongratulated himself because one of his steam-cylinders was only\nthree-eighths of an inch out of truth in the bore Nowadays a good\nfirm would reject a cylinder 1⁄500 of an inch out of truth; and in small\npetrol-engines 1⁄5000 of an inch is sometimes the greatest \"limit of\nerror\" allowed Fig 23 Fig 23 —The eccentric and its rod THE ECCENTRIC\nis used to move the slide-valve to and fro over the steam ports (Fig THE ECCENTRIC\nis used to move the slide-valve to and fro over the steam ports (Fig 23) 23) It consists of three main parts—the sheave, or circular plate S,\nmounted on the crank shaft; and the two straps which encircle it, and\nin which it revolves To one strap is bolted the \"big end\" of the\neccentric rod, which engages at its other end with the valve rod The\nstraps are semicircular and held together by strong bolts, B B, passing\nthrough lugs, or thickenings at the ends of the semicircles The sheave\nhas a deep groove all round the edges, in which the straps ride The\n\"eccentricity\" or \"throw\" of an eccentric is the distance between C2,\nthe centre of the shaft, and C1, the centre of the sheave The throw\nmust equal half of the distance which the slide-valve has to travel\nover the steam ports A tapering steel wedge or key, K, sunk half in\nthe eccentric and half in a slot in the shaft, holds the eccentric steady\nand prevents it slipping Some eccentric sheaves are made in two\nparts, bolted together, so that they may be removed easily without\ndismounting the shaft The eccentric is in principle nothing more than a crank pin so\nexaggerated as to be larger than the shaft of the crank Its\nconvenience lies in the fact that it may be mounted at any point on a\nshaft, whereas a crank can be situated at an end only, if it is not\nactually a V-shaped bend in the shaft itself—in which case its position\nis of course permanent SETTING OF THE SLIDE-VALVE AND ECCENTRIC The subject of valve-setting is so extensive that a full exposition\nmight weary the reader, even if space permitted its inclusion But\ninasmuch as the effectiveness of a reciprocating engine depends\nlargely on the nature and arrangement of the valves, we will glance at\nsome of the more elementary principles",

    "26 It must be noticed here—(1) that steam is admitted at full pressure\nall through the stroke; (2) that admission begins and ends\nsimultaneously with the stroke Now, in actual practice it is necessary\nto admit steam before the piston has ended its travel, so as to cushion\nthe violence of the sudden change of direction of the piston, its rod,\nand other moving parts To effect this, the eccentric is set more than\n90° in advance—that is, more than what the engineers call square Fig 26 shows such an arrangement The angle between E and E1 is called\nthe angle of advance Referring to the valve, you will see that it has\nopened an appreciable amount, though the piston has not yet started\non its rightwards journey \"LAP\" OF THE VALVE—EXPANSION OF STEAM In the simple form of valve that appears in Fig 24, the valve faces\nare just wide enough to cover the steam ports If the eccentric is not\nsquare with the crank, the admission of steam lasts until the very end\nof the stroke; if set a little in advance—that is, given lead—the steam\nis cut off before the piston has travelled quite along the cylinder, and\nreadmitted before the back stroke is accomplished Even with this\nlead the working is very uneconomical, as the steam goes to the\nexhaust at practically the same pressure as that at which it entered the\ncylinder Its property of expansion has been neglected But supposing\nthat steam at 100 lbs pressure were admitted till half-stroke, and then\nsuddenly cut off, the expansive nature of the steam would then\ncontinue to push the piston out until the pressure had decreased to 50\nlbs per square inch, at which pressure it would go to the exhaust Now, observe that all the work done by the steam after the cut-off is\nso much power saved The average pressure on the piston is not so\nhigh as in the first case; still, from a given volume of 100 lbs pressure\nsteam we get much more work HOW THE CUT-OFF IS MANAGED Fig 27 Fig 27 —A slide-valve with \"lap \"\n\n\nFig 28 Fig 28 Look at Fig 27 Here we have a slide-valve, with faces much wider\nthan the steam ports The parts marked black, P P, are those\ncorresponding to the faces of the valves shown in previous diagrams\n(p 54) The shaded parts, L L, are called the lap By increasing the\nlength of the lap we increase the range of expansive working Fig",
    "Fig 28\nshows the piston full to the left; the valve is just on the point of\nopening to admit steam behind the piston The eccentric has a throw\nequal to the breadth of a port + the lap of the valve That this must\nbe so is obvious from a consideration of Fig 27, where the valve is at\nits central position Hence the very simple formula:—Travel of valve\n= 2 × (lap + breadth of port) The path of the eccentric's centre\nround the centre of the shaft is indicated by the usual dotted line (Fig 28) You will notice that the \"angle of advance,\" denoted by the arrow\nA, is now very considerable By the time that the crank C has assumed\nthe position of the line S, the eccentric has passed its dead point, and\nthe valve begins to travel backwards, eventually returning to the\nposition shown in Fig 28, and cutting off the steam supply while the\npiston has still a considerable part of its stroke to make The steam\nthen begins to work expansively, and continues to do so until the\nvalve assumes the position shown in Fig 27 27 If the valve has to have \"lead\" to admit steam before the end of the\nstroke to the other side of the piston, the angle of advance must be\nincreased, and the eccentric centre line would lie on the line E2 Therefore—total angle of advance = angle for lap and angle for lead LIMIT OF EXPANSIVE WORKING Theoretically, by increasing the lap and cutting off the steam\nearlier and earlier in the stroke, we should economize our power more\nand more But in practice a great difficulty is met with—namely, that\nas the steam expands its temperature falls If the cut-off occurs early, say\nat one-third stroke, the great expansion will reduce the temperature of\nthe metal walls of the cylinder to such an extent, that when the next\n\n\nspirt of steam enters from the other end a considerable proportion of\nthe steam's energy will be lost by cooling In such a case, the\ndifference in temperature between admitted steam and exhausted\nsteam is too great for economy Yet we want to utilize as much energy\nas possible How are we to do it COMPOUND ENGINES In the year 1853, John Elder, founder of the shipping firm of Elder\nand Co , Glasgow, introduced the compound engine for use on ships The steam, when exhausted from the high-pressure cylinder, passed\ninto another cylinder of equal stroke but larger diameter, where the\nexpansion continued In modern engines the expansion is extended to\nthree and even four stages, according to the boiler pressure; for it is a\nrule that the higher the initial pressure is, the larger is the number of\nstages of expansion consistent with economical working",
    "In modern engines the expansion is extended to\nthree and even four stages, according to the boiler pressure; for it is a\nrule that the higher the initial pressure is, the larger is the number of\nstages of expansion consistent with economical working Fig 29 Fig 29 29 —Sketch of the arrangement of a triple-expansion marine engin\nIn Fig 29 we have a triple-expansion marine engine Steam enters\nthe high-pressure cylinder[4] at, say, 200 lbs per square inch It\nexhausts at 75 lbs into the large pipe 2, and passes to the\nintermediate cylinder, whence it is exhausted at 25 lbs or so through\npipe 3 to the low-pressure cylinder Finally, it is ejected at about 8 lbs per square inch to the condenser, and is suddenly converted into\nwater; an act which produces a vacuum, and diminishes the back-\npressure of the exhaust from cylinder C In fact, the condenser exerts a\nsucking power on the exhaust side of C's piston ARRANGEMENT OF EXPANSION ENGINES In the illustration the cranks are set at angles of 120°, or a third of\na circle, so that one or other is always at or near the position of\nmaximum turning power Where only two stages are used the\ncylinders are often arranged tandem, both pistons having a common\n\n\npiston rod and crank In order to get a constant turning movement\nthey must be mounted separately, and work cranks set at right angles\nto one another COMPOUND LOCOMOTIVES In 1876 Mr A A Mallet introduced compounding in locomotives; and\nthe practice has been largely adopted The various types of\n\"compounds\" may be classified as follows:—(1) One low-pressure and\none high-pressure cylinder; (2) one high-pressure and two low-\npressure; (3) one low-pressure and two high-pressure; (4) two high-\npressure and two low-pressure The last class is very widely used in\nFrance, America, and Russia, and seems to give the best results Where only two cylinders are used (and sometimes in the case of\nthree and four), a valve arrangement permits the admission of high-\npressure steam to both high and low-pressure cylinders for starting a\ntrain, or moving it up heavy grades REVERSING GEARS Figs 30, 31, 32 Figs 30, 31, 32 —Showing how a reversing gear alters the position\nThe engines of a locomotive or steamship must be reversible—that\nis, when steam is admitted to the cylinders, the engineer must be able\nto so direct it through the steam-ways that the cranks may turn in the\ndesired direction The commonest form of reversing device (invented\nby George Stephenson) is known as Stephenson's Link Gear",
    "The commonest form of reversing device (invented\nby George Stephenson) is known as Stephenson's Link Gear In Fig 30\nwe have a diagrammatic presentment of this gear E1 and E2 are two\neccentrics set square with the crank at opposite ends of a diameter Their rods are connected to the ends of a link, L, which can be raised\nand lowered by means of levers (not shown) B is a block which can\npartly revolve on a pin projecting from the valve rod, working\nthrough a guide, G In Fig 31 the link is half raised, or in \"mid-gear,\"\nas drivers say Eccentric E1 has pushed the lower end of the link fully\nback; E2 has pulled it fully forward; and since any movement of the\none eccentric is counterbalanced by the opposite movement of the\nother, rotation of the eccentrics would not cause the valve to move at\n\n\nall, and no steam could be admitted to the cylinder Eccentric E1 has pushed the lower end of the link fully\nback; E2 has pulled it fully forward; and since any movement of the\none eccentric is counterbalanced by the opposite movement of the\nother, rotation of the eccentrics would not cause the valve to move at\n\n\nall, and no steam could be admitted to the cylinder Let us suppose that Fig 30 denotes one cylinder, crank, rods, etc ,\nof a locomotive The crank has come to rest at its half-stroke; the\nreversing lever is at the mid-gear notch If the engineer desires to turn\nhis cranks in an anti-clockwise direction, he raises the link, which\nbrings the rod of E1 into line with the valve rod and presses the block\nbackwards till the right-hand port is uncovered (Fig",

    "In the De Laval turbine as now constructed the steam is blown from\nstationary nozzles against vanes mounted on a revolving wheel Fig 36 shows the nozzles and a turbine wheel The wheel is made as a\nsolid disc, to the circumference of which the vanes are dovetailed\nseparately in a single row Each vane is of curved section, the concave\nside directed towards the nozzles, which, as will be gathered from the\n\"transparent\" specimen on the right of our illustration, gradually\nexpand towards the mouth This is to allow the expansion of the\nsteam, and a consequent gain of velocity As it issues, each molecule\nstrikes against the concave face of a vane, and, while changing its\ndirection, is robbed of its kinetic energy, which passes to the wheel To turn once more to a stone-throwing comparison, it is as if a boy\nwere pelting the wheel with an enormous number of tiny stones Now,\nescaping high-pressure steam moves very fast indeed To give figures,\nif it enters the small end of a De Laval nozzle at 200 lbs per square\ninch, it will leave the big end at a velocity of 48 miles per minute—\nthat is, at a speed which would take it right round the world in 8½\nhours The wheel itself would not move at more than about one-third\nof this speed as a maximum [7] But even so, it may make as many as\n30,000 revolutions per minute A mechanical difficulty is now\nencountered—namely, that arising from vibration No matter how\ncarefully the turbine wheel may be balanced, it is practically\nimpossible to make its centre of gravity coincide exactly with the\ncentral point of the shaft; in other words, the wheel will be a bit—\nperhaps only a tiny fraction of an ounce—heavier on one side than the\nother This want of truth causes vibration, which, at the high speed\nmentioned, would cause the shaft to knock the bearings in which it\nrevolves to pieces, if—and this is the point—those bearings were close\nto the wheel M de Laval mounted the wheel on a shaft long enough\nbetween the bearings to \"whip,\" or bend a little, and the difficulty was\nsurmounted The normal speed of the turbine wheel is too high for direct driving\nof some machinery, so it is reduced by means of gearing To dynamos,\n\n\npumps, and air-fans it is often coupled direct THE PARSONS TURBINE At the grand naval review held in 1897 in honour of Queen\nVictoria's diamond jubilee, one of the most noteworthy sights was the\nlittle Turbinia of 44½ tons burthen, which darted about among the\nfloating forts at a speed much surpassing that of the fastest\n\"destroyer \" Inside the nimble little craft were engines developing\n2,000 horse power, without any of the clank and vibration which\nusually reigns in the engine-room of a high-speed vessel The Turbinia\nwas the first turbine-driven boat, and as such, even apart from her\nextraordinary pace, she attracted great attention Since 1897 the\nParsons turbine has been installed on many ships, including several\nmen-of-war, and it seems probable that the time is not far distant\nwhen reciprocating engines will be abandoned on all high-speed craft DESCRIPTION OF THE PARSONS TURBINE",

section (see Fig 38), the hollow side facing towards the left The vanes stick out from the drum like short spokes, and their outer\nends almost touch the casing To the latter are attached

then escapes to the\ncondenser through B, having by this time expanded very many times;\nand it is found advisable, for reasons explained in connection with\ncompound steam-engines, to have a separate

of\nthe drums is 11 feet, and each low-pressure turbine weighs 350 tons BALANCING OF THRUST The push exerted by the steam on the blades not only turns the\ndrum, but presses it in the direction in which the steam flows This\nend thrust is counterbalanced by means of the \"dummy\" pistons, P1,\n\n\nP2, P3 Each dummy consists of a number of discs revolving between\nrings projecting from the casing, the distance between discs and rings\nbeing so small that but little steam can pass In the high-pressure\ncompartment the steam pushes P1 to the left with the same pressure\nas it pushes the blades of D1 to the right After completing the first\nstage it fills the passage C, which communicates with the second\npiston, P2, and the pressure on that piston negatives the thrust on D2

which is very unpleasant\nto passengers The turbine, on the other hand, being almost perfectly\nbalanced, runs so smoothly at the highest speeds that, if the hand be\nlaid on the covering, it is sometimes almost impossible to tell whether\nthe machinery is in motion As a consequence of this smooth running\nthere is little noise in the engine-room—a pleasant contrast to the\ndeafening roar of reciprocating engines (2 ) Turbines occupy less\nroom (3 ) They are more easily tended (4 ) They require fewer\nrepairs, since the rubbing surfaces are very small as compared to\nthose of reciprocating engines (5 ) They are more economical at high\nspeeds It must be remembered that a turbine is essentially meant for\nhigh speeds If run slowly, the steam will escape through the many\n\n\npassages without doing much work Owing to its construction, a turbine cannot be reversed like a\ncylinder engine It therefore becomes necessary to fit special astern\nturbines to one or more of the screw shafts, for use when the ship has\nto be stopped or moved astern Under ordinary conditions these\nturbines revolve idly in their cases The highest speed ever attained on the sea was the

case of a steam-boiler the energy of combustion is transmitted\n\n\nto water inside an air-tight vessel The fuel does not actually touch the\n\"working fluid \" In the gas or oil engine the fuel is brought into\ncontact and mixed with the working fluid, which is air It combines\nsuddenly with it in the cylinder, and heat energy is developed so\nrapidly that the act is called an explosion Coal gas, mineral oils,\nalcohol, petrol, etc , all contain hydrogen and carbon If air, which\ncontributes oxygen, be added to any of these in due proportion, the\nmixture becomes highly explosive On a light being applied, oxygen\nand carbon unite, also hydrogen and oxygen, and violent heat is\ngenerated, causing a violent molecular bombardment of the sides of\nthe vessel containing the mixture Now, if the mixture be compressed it\nbecomes hotter and hotter, until a point is reached at which it ignites\nspontaneously Early gas-engines did not compress the charge before\nignition Alphonse Beau de Rochas, a Frenchman, first thought of\nmaking the piston of the engine squeeze the mixture before ignition;\nand from the year 1862, when he proposed this innovation, the\nsuccess of the

    "Alphonse Beau de Rochas, a Frenchman, first thought of\nmaking the piston of the engine squeeze the mixture before ignition;\nand from the year 1862, when he proposed this innovation, the\nsuccess of the internal-combustion engine may be said to date Fig 39 Fig 39 —Showing the four strokes that the piston of a gas-engine mak\nACTION OF THE ENGINE The gas-engine, the oil-engine, and the motor-car engine are\nsimilar in general principles The cylinder has, instead of a slide-valve,\ntwo, or sometimes three, \"mushroom\" valves, which may be described\nas small and thick round plates, with bevelled edges, mounted on the\nends of short rods, called stems These valves open into the cylinder,\nupwards, downwards, or horizontally, as the case may be; being\npushed in by cams projecting from a shaft rotated by the engine For\nthe present we will confine our attention to the series of operations\n\n\nwhich causes the engine to work This series is called the Beau de\nRochas, or Otto, cycle, and includes four movements of the piston This series is called the Beau de\nRochas, or Otto, cycle, and includes four movements of the piston Reference to Fig Reference to Fig 39 will show exactly what happens in a gas-engine—\n(1) The piston moves from left to right, and just as the movement\ncommences valves G (gas) and A (air) open to admit the explosive\nmixture By the time that P has reached the end of its travel these\nvalves have closed again (2) The piston returns to the left,\ncompressing the mixture, which has no way of escape open to it At\nthe end of the stroke the charge is ignited by an incandescent tube I\n(in motor car and some stationary engines by an electric spark), and\n(3) the piston flies out again on the \"explosion\" stroke Before it\nreaches the limit position, valve E (exhaust) opens, and (4) the piston\nflies back under the momentum of the fly-wheel, driving out the burnt\ngases through the still open E The \"cycle\" is now complete There has\nbeen suction, compression (including ignition), combustion, and\nexhaustion It is evident that a heavy fly-wheel must be attached to\nthe crank shaft, because the energy of one stroke (the explosion) has\nto serve for the whole cycle; in other words, for two complete\nrevolutions of the crank A single-cylinder steam-engine develops an\nimpulse every half-turn—that is, four times as often In order to get a\nmore constant turning effect, motor cars have two, three, four, six,\nand even eight cylinders Four-cylinder engines are at present the\nmost popular type for powerful cars THE MOTOR CAR Fig 40 Fig 40 —Plan of the chassis of a motor car We will now proceed to an examination of the motor car, which, in\naddition to mechanical apparatus for the transmission of motion to\nthe driving-wheels, includes all the fundamental adjuncts of the\ninternal-combustion engine [8] Fig 40 is a bird's-eye view of the\nchassis (or \"works\" and wheels) of a car, from which the body has been\nremoved Starting at the left, we have the handle for setting the\nengine in motion; the engine (a two-cylinder in this case); the fly-\nwheel, inside which is the clutch; the gear-box, containing the cogs\nfor altering the speed of revolution of the driving-wheels relatively to\n\n\nthat of the engine; the propeller shaft; the silencer, for deadening the\nnoise of the exhaust; and the bevel-gear, for turning the driving-\nwheels In the particular type of car here considered you will notice\nthat a \"direct,\" or shaft, drive is used The shaft has at each end a\nflexible, or \"universal,\" joint, which allows the shaft to turn freely,\neven though it may not be in a line with the shaft projecting from the\ngear-box It must be remembered that the engine and gear-box are\nmounted on the frame, between which and the axles are springs, so\nthat when the car bumps up and down, the shaft describes part of a\ncircle, of which the gear-box end is the centre An alternative method of driving is by means of chains, which run\nround sprocket (cog) wheels on the ends of a shaft crossing the frame\njust behind the gear-box, and round larger sprockets attached to the\nhubs of the driving-wheels In such a case the axles of the driving-\nwheel are fixed to the springs, and the wheels revolve round them Where a Cardan (shaft) drive is used the axles are attached rigidly to\nthe wheels at one end, and extend, through tubes fixed to the springs,\nto bevel-wheels in a central compensating-gear box (of which more\npresently) Several parts—the carburetter, tanks, governor, and pump—are not\nshown in the general plan These will be referred to in the more\ndetailed account that follows THE STARTING-HANDLE Fig 41 Fig 41 —The starting-handle Fig 41 gives the starting-handle in part section The handle H is\nattached to a tube which terminates in a clutch, C A powerful spring\nkeeps C normally apart from a second clutch, C1, keyed to the engine\nshaft When the driver wishes to start the engine he presses the handle\ntowards the right, brings the clutches together, and turns the handle\nin a clockwise direction As soon as the engine begins to fire, the faces\nof the clutches slip over one another THE ENGINE Fig 42 Fig 42 —End and cross sections of a two-cylinder m\nWe next examine the two-cylinder engine (Fig 42) Each cylinder\nis surrounded by a water-jacket, through which water is circulated by\na pump[9] (Fig 43) The heat generated by combustion is so great that\nthe walls of the cylinder would soon become red-hot unless some of\nthe heat were quickly carried away The pistons are of \"trunk\" form—\nthat is, long enough to act as guides and absorb the oblique thrust of\nthe piston rods Three or more piston rings lying in slots (not shown)\nprevent the escape of gas past the piston It is interesting to notice\nthat the efficiency of an internal-combustion engine depends so\nlargely on the good fit of these moving parts, that cylinders, pistons,\nand rings must be exceedingly true A good firm will turn out\nstandard parts which are well within 1⁄5000 of an inch of perfect truth It is also a wonderful testimony to the quality of the materials used\nthat, if properly looked after, an engine which has made many\nmillions of revolutions, at the rate of 1,000 to 2,000 per minute, often\nshows no appreciable signs of wear In one particular test an engine\nwas run continuously for several months, and at the end of the trial was\nin absolutely perfect condition The cranks revolve in an oil-tight case (generally made of\naluminium), and dip in oil, which they splash up into the cylinder to\nkeep the piston well lubricated The plate, P P, through a slot in\nwhich the piston rod works, prevents an excess of oil being flung up Channels are provided for leading oil into the bearings The cranks are\n180° apart While one piston is being driven out by an explosion, the\nother is compressing its charge prior to ignition, so that the one action\ndeadens the other Therefore two explosions occur in one revolution\nof the cranks, and none during the next revolution If both cranks\nwere in line, the pistons would move together, giving one explosion\neach revolution",
    "If both cranks\nwere in line, the pistons would move together, giving one explosion\neach revolution Fig 43 Fig 43 43 —Showing how the water which cools the cylinders \nThe valve seats, and the inlet and exhaust pipes, are seen in\nsection The inlet valve here works automatically, being pulled in by\n\n\nsuction; but on many engines—on all powerful engines—the inlet, like\nthe exhaust valve, is lifted by a cam, lest it should stick or work\nirregularly Three dotted circles show A, a cog on the crank shaft; B, a\n\"lay\" cog, which transmits motion to C, on a short shaft rotating the\ncam that lifts the exhaust valve C, having twice as many teeth as A,\nrevolves at half its rate This ensures that the valve shall be lifted only\nonce in two revolutions of the crank shaft to which it is geared The\ncogs are timed, or arranged, so that the cam begins to lift the valve\nwhen the piston has made about seven-eighths of its explosion stroke,\nand closes the valve at the end of the exhaust stroke THE CARBURETTER A motor car generally uses petrol as its fuel Petrol is one of the\nmore volatile products of petroleum, and has a specific gravity of\nabout 680—that is, volume for volume, its weight is to that of water\nin the proportion of 680 to 1,000 It is extremely dangerous, as it\ngives off an inflammable gas at ordinary temperatures Benzine, which\nwe use to clean clothes, is practically the same as petrol, and should\nbe treated with equal care The function of a carburetter is to reduce\npetrol to a very fine spray and mix it with a due quantity of air The\ndevice consists of two main parts (Fig 44)—the float chamber and the\njet chamber In the former is a contrivance for regulating the petrol\nsupply A float—a cork, or air-tight metal box—is arranged to move\nfreely up and down the stem of a needle-valve, which closes the inlet\nfrom the tank At the bottom of the chamber are two pivoted levers,\nW W, which, when the float rests on them, tip up and lift the valve Petrol flows in and raises the float This allows the valve to sink and\ncut off the supply If the valve is a good fit and the float is of the\ncorrect weight, the petrol will never rise higher than the tip of the jet\nG Fig 44 Fig 44 —Section of a carburetter The suction of the engine makes petrol spirt through the jet (which\nhas a very small hole in its end) and atomize itself against a spraying-\ncone, A It then passes to the engine inlet pipe through a number of\n\n\nopenings, after mixing with air entering from below An extra air\ninlet, controllable by the driver, is generally added, unless the\ncarburetter be of a type which automatically maintains constant\nproportions of air and vapour The jet chamber is often surrounded by\na jacket, through which part of the hot exhaust gases circulate In cold\nweather especially this is a valuable aid to vaporization Fig 45 Fig 45 —Sketch of the electrical ignition arrangements on \nIGNITION OF THE CHARGE All petrol-cars now use electrical ignition There are two main\nsystems—(1) by an accumulator and induction coil; (2) magneto\nignition, by means of a small dynamo driven by the engine A general\narrangement of the first is shown in Fig 45 A disc, D, of some\ninsulating material—fibre or vulcanite—is mounted on the cam, or\nhalf-speed, shaft Into the circumference is let a piece of brass, called\nthe contact-piece, through which a screw passes to the cam shaft A\nmovable plate, M P, which can be rotated concentrically with D\nthrough part of a circle, carries a \"wipe\" block at the end of a spring,\nwhich presses it against D The spring itself is attached to an insulated\nplate When the revolution of D brings the wipe and contact together,\ncurrent flows from the accumulator through switch S to the wipe;\nthrough the contact-piece to C; from C to M P and the induction coil;\nand back to the accumulator This is the primary, or low-tension, circuit A high-tension current is induced by the coil in the secondary circuit,\nindicated by dotted lines [10] In this circuit is the sparking-plug (see\nFig 46), having a central insulated rod in connection with one\nterminal of the secondary coil Between it and a bent wire projecting\nfrom the iron casing of the plug (in contact with the other terminal of\nthe secondary coil through the metal of the engine, to which one wire\nof the circuit is attached) is a small gap, across which the secondary\ncurrent leaps when the primary current is broken by the wipe and\ncontact parting company The spark is intensely hot, and suffices to\nignite the compressed charge in the cylinder",
    "The spark is intensely hot, and suffices to\nignite the compressed charge in the cylinder Fig 46 Fig 46 —Section of a sparking-plug ADVANCING THE SPARK We will assume that the position of W (in Fig 45) is such that the\ncontact touches W at the moment when the piston has just completed\nthe compression stroke Now, the actual combustion of the charge\noccupies an appreciable time, and with the engine running at high\nspeed the piston would have travelled some way down the cylinder\nbefore the full force of the explosion was developed But by raising\nlever L, the position of W may be so altered that contact is made\nslightly before the compression stroke is complete, so that the charge\nis fairly alight by the time the piston has altered its direction This is\ncalled advancing the spark GOVERNING THE ENGINE There are several methods of controlling the speed of internal-\ncombustion engines The operating mechanism in most cases is a\ncentrifugal ball-governor When the speed has reached the fixed limit\nit either (1) raises the exhaust valve, so that no fresh charges are\ndrawn in; (2) prevents the opening of the inlet valve; or (3) throttles\nthe gas supply The last is now most commonly used on motor cars, in\nconjunction with some device for putting it out of action when the\ndriver wishes to exceed the highest speed that it normally permits Fig 47 Fig 47 —One form of governor used on motor car\nA sketch of a neat governor, with regulating attachment, is given in\nFig 47 The governor shaft is driven from the engine As the balls, B\nB, increase their velocity, they fly away from the shaft and move the\narms, A A, and a sliding tube, C, towards the right This rocks the\nlever R, and allows the valves in the inlet pipe to close and reduce the\nsupply of air and gas A wedge, W, which can be raised or lowered by\nlever L, intervenes between the end of R and the valve stem If this\nlever be lifted to its highest position, the governing commences at a\nlower speed, as the valve then has but a short distance to travel before\nclosing completely For high speeds the driver depresses L, forces the\n\n\nwedge down, and so minimizes the effect of the governor THE CLUTCH The engine shaft has on its rear end the fly-wheel, which has a\nbroad and heavy rim, turned to a conical shape inside Close to this,\nrevolving loosely on the shaft, is the clutch plate, a heavy disc with a\nbroad edge so shaped as to fit the inside of a fly-wheel It is generally\nfaced with leather A very strong spring presses the plate into the fly-\nwheel, and the resulting friction is sufficient to prevent any slip Projections on the rear of the clutch engage with the gear-box shaft The driver throws out the clutch by depressing a lever with his foot Some clutches dispense with the leather lining These are termed\nmetal to metal clutches THE GEAR-BOX We now come to a very interesting detail of the motor car, the\ngear-box The steam-engine has its speed increased by admitting more\nsteam to the cylinders But an explosion engine must be run at a high\nspeed to develop its full power, and when heavier work has to be\ndone on a hill it becomes necessary to alter the speed ratio of engine\nto driving-wheels",
    "But an explosion engine must be run at a high\nspeed to develop its full power, and when heavier work has to be\ndone on a hill it becomes necessary to alter the speed ratio of engine\nto driving-wheels Our illustration (Fig 48) gives a section of a gear-\nbox, which will serve as a typical example It provides three forward\nspeeds and one reverse To understand how it works, we must study\nthe illustration carefully Pinion 1 is mounted on a hollow shaft\nturned by the clutch Into the hollow shaft projects the end of another\nshaft carrying pinions 6 and 4 Pinion 6 slides up and down this shaft,\nwhich is square at this point, but round inside the loose pinion 4 Pinions 2 and 3 are keyed to a square secondary shaft, and are\nrespectively always in gear with 1 and 4; but 5 can be slid backwards\nand forwards so as to engage or disengage with 6 In the illustration\nno gear is \"in \" If the engine is working, 1 revolves 2, 2 turns 3, and 3\nrevolves 4 idly on its shaft Fig 48 Fig 48 —The gear-box of a motor car To get the lowest, or \"first,\" speed the driver moves his lever and\n\n\nslides 5 into gear with 6 The transmission then is: 1 turns 2, 2 turns\n5, 5 turns 6, 6 turns the propeller shaft through the universal joint For the second speed, 5 and 6 are disengaged, and 6 is moved up the\npage, as it were, till projections on it interlock with slots in 4; thus\ndriving 1, 2, 3, 4, shaft For the third, or \"solid,\" speed, 6 is pulled\ndown into connection with 1, and couples the engine shaft direct to\nthe propeller shaft The \"reverse\" is accomplished by raising a long pinion, 7, which\nlies in the gear-box under 5 and 6 The drive then is 1, 2, 5, 7, 6 There being an odd number of pinions now engaged, the propeller\nshaft turns in the reverse direction to that of the engine shaft Fig 49 Fig 49 THE COMPENSATING GEAR Every axle of a railway train carries a wheel at each end, rigidly\nattached to it When rounding a corner the outside wheel has further\nto travel than the other, and consequently one or both wheels must\nslip The curves are made so gentle, however, that the amount of slip\nis very small But with a traction-engine, motor car, or tricycle the\ncase is different, for all have to describe circles of very small diameter\nin proportion to the length of the vehicle Therefore in every case a\ncompensating gear is fitted, to allow the wheels to turn at different\nspeeds, while permitting them both to drive",
    "Therefore in every case a\ncompensating gear is fitted, to allow the wheels to turn at different\nspeeds, while permitting them both to drive Fig 49 is an exaggerated\nsketch of the gear The axles of the moving wheels turn inside tubes\nattached to the springs and a central casing (not shown), and\nterminate in large bevel-wheels, C and D Between these are small\nbevels mounted on a shaft supported by the driving drum If the latter\nbe rotated, the bevels would turn C and D at equal speeds, assuming\nthat both axles revolve without friction in their bearings We will\nsuppose that the drum is turned 50 times a minute Now, if one wheel\nbe held, the other will revolve 100 times a minute; or, if one be\nslowed, the other will increase its speed by a corresponding amount The average speed remains 50 It should be mentioned that drum A\nhas incorporated with it on the outside a bevel-wheel (not shown)\n\n\nrotated by a smaller bevel on the end of the propeller shaft THE SILENCER The petrol-engine, as now used, emits the products of combustion\nat a high pressure If unchecked, they expand violently, and cause a\npartial vacuum in the exhaust pipe, into which the air rushes back\nwith such violence as to cause a loud noise Devices called silencers are\ntherefore fitted, to render the escape more gradual, and split it up\namong a number of small apertures The simplest form of silencer is a\ncylindrical box, with a number of finely perforated tubes passing from\nend to end of it The exhaust gases pouring into the box maintain a\nconstant pressure somewhat higher than that of the atmosphere, but\nas the gases are escaping from it in a fairly steady stream the noise\nbecomes a gentle hiss rather than a \"pop \" There are numerous types\nof silencers, but all employ this principle in one form or another",
    "\" There are numerous types\nof silencers, but all employ this principle in one form or another THE BRAKES Every car carries at least two brakes of band pattern—one, usually\nworked by a side hand-lever, acting on the axle or hubs of the driving-\nwheel; the other, operated by the foot, acting on the transmission gear\n(see Fig 48) 48) The latter brake is generally arranged to withdraw the\nclutch simultaneously Tests have proved that even heavy cars can be\npulled up in astonishingly short distances, considering their rate of\ntravel Trials made in the United States with a touring car and a four-\nin-hand coach gave 25⅓ and 70 feet respectively for the distance in\nwhich the speed could be reduced from sixteen miles per hour to zero SPEED OF CARS As regards speed, motor cars can rival the fastest express trains,\neven on long journeys In fact, feats performed during the Gordon-\nBennett and other races have equalled railway performances over\nequal distances When we come to record speeds, we find a car,\nspecially built for the purpose, covering a mile in less than half a\nminute A speed of over 120 miles an hour has actually been reached Engines of 150 h p can now be packed into a vehicle scaling less than\n\n\n1½ tons Even on touring cars are often found engines developing 40\nto 60 h p , which force the car up steep hills at a pace nothing less\nthan astonishing In the future the motor car will revolutionize our\nmodes of life to an extent comparable to the changes effected by the\nadvent of the steam-engine Even since 1896, when the \"man-with-\nthe-flag\" law was abolished in the British Isles, the motor has reduced\ndistances, opened up country districts, and generally quickened the\npulses of the community in a manner which makes it hazardous to\nprophesy how the next generation will live",
    "Even since 1896, when the \"man-with-\nthe-flag\" law was abolished in the British Isles, the motor has reduced\ndistances, opened up country districts, and generally quickened the\npulses of the community in a manner which makes it hazardous to\nprophesy how the next generation will live Note —The author is much indebted to Mr Wilfrid J Lineham, M Inst C E , for\nseveral of the illustrations which appear in the above chapter [8] Steam-driven cars are not considered in this chapter, as\ntheir principle is much the same as that of the ordinary\nlocomotive [9] On some cars natural circulation is used, the hot water\nflowing from the top of the cylinder to the tank, from which it\nreturns, after being cooled, to the bottom of the cylinder [10] For explanation of the induction coil, see p 122\nChapter V ELECTRICAL APPARATUS What is electricity —Forms of electricity—Magnetism—The\npermanent magnet—Lines of force—Electro-magnets—The\nelectric \nbell—The \ninduction \ncoil—The \ncondenser—\nTransformation of current—Uses of the induction coil WHAT IS ELECTRICITY Of the ultimate nature of electricity, as of that of heat and light,\nwe are at present ignorant But it has been clearly established that all\n\n\nthree phenomena are but manifestations of the energy pervading the\nuniverse By means of suitable apparatus one form can be converted\ninto another form The heat of fuel burnt in a boiler furnace develops\nmechanical energy in the engine which the boiler feeds with steam The engine revolves a dynamo, and the electric current thereby\ngenerated can be passed through wires to produce mechanical motion,\nheat, or light We must remain content, therefore, with assuming that\nelectricity is energy or motion transmitted through the ether from\nmolecule to molecule, or from atom to atom, of matter Scientific\ninvestigation has taught us how to produce it at will, how to harness\nit to our uses, and how to measure it; but not what it is That question\nmay, perhaps, remain unanswered till the end of human history A\ngreat difficulty attending the explanation of electrical action is this—\nthat, except in one or two cases, no comparison can be established\nbetween it and the operation of gases and fluids When dealing with\nthe steam-engine, any ordinary intelligence soon grasps the principles\nwhich govern the use of steam in cylinders or turbines The diagrams\nshow, it is hoped, quite plainly \"how it works \" But electricity is\nelusive, invisible; and the greatest authorities cannot say what goes on\nat the poles of a magnet or on the surface of an electrified body Even\nthe existence of \"negative\" and \"positive\" electricity is problematical However, we see the effects, and we know that if one thing is done\nanother thing happens; so that we are at least able to use terms which,\nwhile convenient, are not at present controverted by scientific\nprogress FORMS OF ELECTRICITY Rub a vulcanite rod and hold one end near some tiny pieces of\npaper They fly to it, stick to it for a time, and then fall off The rod\nwas electrified—that is, its surface was affected in such a way as to be\nin a state of molecular strain which the contact of the paper fragments\nalleviated By rubbing large surfaces and collecting the electricity in\nsuitable receivers the strain can be made to relieve itself in the form\nof a violent discharge accompanied by a bright flash This form of\nelectricity is known as static Next, place a copper plate and a zinc plate into a jar full of diluted\n\n\nsulphuric acid If a wire be attached to them a current of electricity is\nsaid to flow along the wire We must not, however, imagine that\nanything actually moves along inside the wire, as water, steam, or air,\npasses through a pipe Professor Trowbridge says,[11] \"No other\nagency for transmitting power can be stopped by such slight obstacles\nas electricity A thin sheet of paper placed across a tube conveying\ncompressed air would be instantly ruptured It would take a wall of\nsteel at least an inch thick to stand the pressure of steam which is\ndriving a 10,000 horse-power engine A thin layer of dirt beneath the\nwheels of an electric car can prevent the current which propels the car\nfrom passing to the rail, and then back to the power-house \" There\nwould, indeed, be a puncture of the paper if the current had a\nsufficient voltage, or pressure; yet the fact remains that current\nelectricity can be very easily confined to its conductor by means of\nsome insulating or nonconducting envelope MAGNETISM The most familiar form of electricity is that known as magnetism When a bar of steel or iron is magnetized, it is supposed that the\nmolecules in it turn and arrange themselves with all their north-\nseeking poles towards the one end of the bar, and their south-seeking\npoles towards the other If the bar is balanced freely on a pivot, it\ncomes to rest pointing north and south; for, the earth being a huge\nmagnet, its north pole attracts all the north-seeking poles of the\nmolecules, and its south poles the south-seeking poles (The north-\nseeking pole of a magnet is marked N , though it is in reality the south\npole; for unlike poles are mutually attractive, and like poles\nrepellent )\nThere are two forms of magnet—permanent and temporary If steel\nis magnetized, it remains so; but soft iron loses practically all its\nmagnetism as soon as the cause of magnetization is withdrawn This is\nwhat we should expect; for steel is more closely compacted than iron,\nand the molecules therefore would be able to turn about more easily [12] It is fortunate for us that this is so, since on the rapid\nmagnetization and demagnetization of soft iron depends the action of\nmany of our electrical mechanisms THE PERMANENT MAGNET Magnets are either (1) straight, in which case they are called bar\nmagnets; or (2) of horseshoe form, as in Figs 50 and 51 By bending\nthe magnet the two poles are brought close together, and the\nattraction of both may be exercised simultaneously on a bar of steel or\niron LINES OF FORCE In Fig 50 are seen a number of dotted lines These are called lines\nof magnetic force If you lay a sheet of paper on a horseshoe magnet\nand sprinkle it with iron dust, you will at once notice how the\nparticles arrange themselves in curves similar in shape to those shown\nin the illustration It is supposed (it cannot be proved) that magnetic\nforce streams away from the N pole and describes a circular course\nthrough the air back to the S pole The same remark applies to the\nbar magnet ELECTRICAL MAGNETS Fig 50 Fig 50 —Permanent magnet, and the \"lines of\nforce\" emanating from it If an insulated wire is wound round and round a steel or iron bar\nfrom end to end, and has its ends connected to the terminals of an\nelectric battery, current rotates round the bar, and the bar is\nmagnetized By increasing the strength and volume of the current, and\nmultiplying the number of turns of wire, the attractive force of the\nmagnet is increased Now disconnect the wires from the battery If of\niron, the magnet at once loses its attractive force; but if of steel, it\nretains it in part Instead of a simple horseshoe-shaped bar, two\nshorter bars riveted into a plate are generally used for electromagnets\nof this type Coils of wire are wound round each bar, and connected\nso as to form one continuous whole; but the wire of one coil is wound\nin the direction opposite to that of the other The free end of each\ngoes to a battery terminal In Fig 51 you will notice that some of the \"lines of force\" are\ndeflected through the iron bar A They pass more easily through iron\nthan through air;

    "The main features of a wireless telegraphy outfit are shown in Figs 59 and 61 THE TRANSMITTER APPARATUS We will first consider the transmitting outfit (Fig 59) It includes a\nbattery, dispatching key, and an induction coil having its secondary\ncircuit terminals connected with two wires, the one leading to an\nearth-plate, the other carried aloft on poles or suspended from a kite In the large station at Poldhu, Cornwall, for transatlantic signalling,\nthere are special wooden towers 215 feet high, between which the\naërial wires hang At their upper and lower ends respectively the\nearth and aërial wires terminate in brass balls separated by a gap When the operator depresses the key the induction coil charges these\nballs and the wires attached thereto with high-tension electricity As\nsoon as the quantity collected exceeds the resistance of the air-gap, a\ndischarge takes place between the balls, and the ether round the aërial\nwire is violently disturbed, and waves of electrical energy are\npropagated through it The rapidity with which the discharges follow\none another, and their travelling power, depends on the strength of\nthe induction coil, the length of the air-gap, and the capacity of the\nwires The rapidity with which the discharges follow\none another, and their travelling power, depends on the strength of\nthe induction coil, the length of the air-gap, and the capacity of the\nwires [14]\nFig 59 Fig 59 —Sketch of the transmitter of a wireless telegrap\nFig 60 Fig 60 —A Marconi coherer RECEIVING APPARATUS The human body is quite insensitive to these etheric waves We\ncannot feel, hear, or see them But at the receiving station there is\nwhat may be called an \"electric eye \" Technically it is named a coherer A Marconi coherer is seen in Fig 60 Inside a small glass tube\n\n\nexhausted of air are two silver plugs, P P, carrying terminals, T T,\nprojecting through the glass at both ends A small gap separates the\nplugs at the centre, and this gap is partly filled with nickel-silver\npowder If the terminals of the coherer are attached to those of a\nbattery, practically no current will pass under ordinary conditions, as\nthe particles of nickel-silver touch each other very lightly and make a\n\"bad contact \" But if the coherer is also attached to wires leading into\nthe earth and air, and ether waves strike those wires, at every impact\nthe particles will cohere—that is, pack tightly together—and allow\nbattery current to pass The property of cohesion of small conductive\nbodies when influenced by Hertzian waves was first noticed in 1874\nby Professor D",
    "The property of cohesion of small conductive\nbodies when influenced by Hertzian waves was first noticed in 1874\nby Professor D E Hughes while experimenting with a telephone Hughes while experimenting with a telephone Fig 61 Fig 61 —Sketch of the receiving apparatus in a wireless tele\nWe are now in a position to examine the apparatus of which a\ncoherer forms part (Fig 61) First, we notice the aërial and earth\nwires, to which are attached other wires from battery A This battery\ncircuit passes round the relay magnet R and through two choking\ncoils, whose function is to prevent the Hertzian waves entering the\nbattery The relay, when energized, brings contact D against E and\ncloses the circuit of battery B, which is much more powerful than\nbattery A, and operates the magnet M as well as the tapper, which is\npractically an electric bell minus the gong (The tapper circuit is\nindicated by the dotted lines )\nWe will suppose the transmitter of a distant station to be at work The electric waves strike the aërial wire of the receiving station, and\ncause the coherer to cohere and pass current The relay is closed, and\nboth tapper and Morse inker begin to work The tapper keeps striking\nthe coherer and shakes the particles loose after every cohesion If this\nwere not done the current of A would pass continuously after\ncohesion had once taken place When the key of the transmitter is\npressed down, the waves follow one another very quickly, and the\n\n\nacquired conductivity of the coherer is only momentarily destroyed by\nthe tap of the hammer During the impression of a dot by the Morse\ninker, contact is made and broken repeatedly; but as the armature of\nthe inker is heavy and slow to move it does not vibrate in time with\nthe relay and tapper Therefore the Morse instrument reproduces in\ndots and dashes the short and long depressions of the key at the\ntransmitting station, while the tapper works rapidly in time with the\nrelay The Morse inker is shown diagrammatically While current\npasses through M the armature is pulled towards it, the end P,\ncarrying an inked wheel, rises, and a mark is made on the tape W,\nwhich is moved continuously being drawn forward off reel R by the\nclockwork—or electrically-driven rollers R1 R2 SYNTONIC TRANSMISSION If a number of transmitting stations are sending out messages\nsimultaneously, a jumble of signals would affect all the receivers\nround, unless some method were employed for rendering a receiver\nsensitive only to the waves intended to influence it Also, if distinction\nwere impossible, even with one transmitter in action its message\nmight go to undesired stations There are various ways of \"tuning\" receivers and transmitters, but\nthe principle underlying them all is analogous to that of mechanical\nvibration If a weight is suspended from the end of a spiral spring, and\ngiven an upward blow, it bobs up and down a certain number of times\nper minute, every movement from start to finish having exactly the\nsame duration as the rest The resistance of the air and the internal\nfriction of the spring gradually lessen the amplitude of the\nmovements, and the weight finally comes to rest Suppose that the\nweight scales 30 lbs , and that it naturally bobs twenty times a\nminute If you now take a feather and give it a push every three\nseconds you can coax it into vigorous motion, assuming that every\npush catches it exactly on the rebound The same effect would be\nproduced more slowly if 6 or 9 second intervals were substituted But\nif you strike it at 4, 5, or 7 second intervals it will gradually cease to\noscillate, as the effect of one blow neutralizes that of another The\nsame phenomenon is witnessed when two tuning-forks of equal pitch\n\n\nare mounted near one another, and one is struck The other soon picks\nup the note But a fork of unequal pitch would remain dumb Now, every electrical circuit has a \"natural period of oscillation\" in\nwhich its electric charge vibrates It is found possible to \"tune,\" or\n\"syntonize,\" the aërial rod or wire of a receiving station with a\ntransmitter A vertical wire about 200 feet in length, says Professor\nJ A Fleming,[15] has a natural time period of electrical oscillation of\nabout one-millionth of a second Therefore if waves strike this wire a\nmillion times a second they will reinforce one another and influence\nthe coherer; whereas a less or greater frequency will leave it\npractically unaffected By adjusting the receiving circuit to the\ntransmitter, or vice versâ, selective wireless telegraphy becomes\npossible ADVANCE OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY The history of wireless telegraphy may be summed up as follows:—\n1842 —Professor \nMorse \nsent \naërial \nmessages \nacross \nthe\nSusquehanna River A line containing a battery and transmitter was\ncarried on posts along one bank and \"earthed\" in the river at each end On the other bank was a second wire attached to a receiver and\nsimilarly earthed Whenever contact was made and broken on the\nbattery side, the receiver on the other was affected Distance about 1\nmile 1859",

    "66 The strength of the current induced in a circuit cutting the lines of\nforce of a magnet is called its pressure, voltage, or electro-motive\nforce (expressed shortly E M F ) It may be compared with the pounds-\nto-the-square-inch of steam In order to produce an E M F of one volt\nit is calculated that 100,000,000 lines of force must be cut every\nsecond The voltage depends on three things:—(1 ) The strength of the\nmagnet: the stronger it is, the greater the number of lines of force\ncoming from it (2 ) The length of the conductor cutting the lines of\nforce: the longer it is, the more lines it will cut (3 ) The speed at\nwhich the conductor moves: the faster it travels, the more lines it will\ncut in a given time It follows that a powerful dynamo, or mechanical\nproducer of current, must have strong magnets and a long conductor;\nand the latter must be moved at a high speed across the lines of force A SIMPLE DYNAMO In Fig In Fig 67 we have the simplest possible form of dynamo—a single\nturn of wire, w x y z, mounted on a spindle, and having one end\nattached to an insulated ring C, the other to an insulated ring C1 Two\nsmall brushes, B B1, of wire gauze or carbon, rubbing continuously\nagainst these collecting rings, connect them with a wire which\ncompletes the circuit The armature, as the revolving coil is called, is\nmounted between the poles of a magnet, where the lines of force are\nthickest These lines are supposed to stream from the N to the S pole In Fig 67 the armature has reached a position in which y z and w x\nare cutting no, or very few, lines of force, as they move practically\nparallel to the lines This is called the zero position Fig 67 Fig 67 Fig 68 Fig 68 In Fig 68 the armature, moving at right angles to the lines of force,\ncuts a maximum number in a given time, and the current induced in\nthe coil is therefore now most intense Here we must stop a moment\nto consider how to decide in which direction the current flows The\narmature is revolving in a clockwise direction, and y z, therefore, is\nmoving downwards Now, suppose that you rest your left hand on the\nN pole of the magnet so that the arm lies in a line with the magnet Point your forefinger towards the S pole It will indicate the direction\nof the lines of force Bend your other three fingers downwards over the\nedge of the N pole They will indicate the direction in which the\nconductor is moving across the magnetic field Stick out the thumb at\nright angles to the forefinger It points in the direction in which the\ninduced current is moving through the nearer half of the coil Therefore lines of force, conductor, and induced current travel in\nplanes which, like the top and two adjacent sides of a box, are at right\nangles to one another While current travels from z to y—that is, from the ring C1 to y—it\nalso travels from x to w, because w x rises while y z descends So that\na current circulates through the coil and the exterior part of the\ncircuit, including the lamp After z y has passed the lowest possible\npoint of the circle it begins to ascend, w x to descend The direction of\nthe current is therefore reversed; and as the change is repeated every\nhalf-revolution this form of dynamo is called an alternator or creator\nof alternating currents A well-known type of alternator is the\nmagneto machine which sends shocks through any one who completes\nthe external circuit by holding the brass handles connected by wires\nto the brushes The faster the handle of the machine is turned the\nmore frequent is the alternation, and the stronger the current Fig 69 Fig 69",
    "69 CONTINUOUS-CURRENT DYNAMOS An alternating current is not so convenient for some purposes as a\ncontinuous current It is therefore sometimes desirable (even\nnecessary) to convert the alternating into a uni-directional or\ncontinuous current How this is done is shown in Figs 69 and 70 In\nplace of the two collecting rings C C1, we now have a single ring split\nlongitudinally into two portions, one of which is connected to each\nend of the coil w x y z In\nplace of the two collecting rings C C1, we now have a single ring split\nlongitudinally into two portions, one of which is connected to each\nend of the coil w x y z In Fig 69 brush B has just passed the gap on to\nsegment C, brush B1 on to segment C1 For half a revolution these\nremain respectively in contact; then, just as y z begins to rise and w x\nto descend, the brushes cross the gaps again and exchange segments,\nso that the current is perpetually flowing one way through the circuit The effect of the commutator[17] is, in fact, equivalent to transposing\nthe brushes of the collecting rings of the alternator every time the coil\nreaches a zero position The effect of the commutator[17] is, in fact, equivalent to transposing\nthe brushes of the collecting rings of the alternator every time the coil\nreaches a zero position Figs Figs 71 and 72 give end views in section of the coil and the\ncommutator, with the coil in the position of minimum and maximum\nefficiency The arrow denotes the direction of movement; the double\ndotted lines the commutator end of the revolving coil Fig 70 Fig 70",
    "70 PRACTICAL CONTINUOUS-CURRENT DYNAMOS The electrical output of our simple dynamo would be increased if,\ninstead of a single turn of wire, we used a coil of many turns A\nfurther improvement would result from mounting on the shaft, inside\nthe coil, a core or drum of iron, to entice the lines of force within\nreach of the revolving coil It is evident that any lines which pass\nthrough the air outside the circle described by the coil cannot be cut,\nand are wasted It is evident that any lines which pass\nthrough the air outside the circle described by the coil cannot be cut,\nand are wasted Fig 71 Fig 71 Fig 72 Fig 72 72 The core is not a solid mass of iron, but built up of a number of\nvery thin iron discs threaded on the shaft and insulated from one\nanother to prevent electric eddies, which would interfere with the\ninduced current in the conductor [18] Sometimes there are openings\nthrough the core from end to end to ventilate and cool it Fig 73 Fig 73 73 We have already noticed that in the case of a single coil the current\nrises and falls in a series of pulsations Such a form of armature would\nbe unsuitable for large dynamos, which accordingly have a number of\ncoils wound over their drums, at equal distances round the\ncircumference, and a commutator divided into an equal number of\nsegments The subject of drum winding is too complicated for brief\ntreatment, and we must therefore be content with noticing that the\ncoils are so connected to their respective commutator segments and to\none another that they mutually assist one another",
    "The subject of drum winding is too complicated for brief\ntreatment, and we must therefore be content with noticing that the\ncoils are so connected to their respective commutator segments and to\none another that they mutually assist one another A glance at Fig 73\nwill help to explain this Here we have in section a number of\nconductors on the right of the drum (marked with a cross to show that\ncurrent is moving, as it were, into the page), connected with\nconductors on the left (marked with a dot to signify current coming\nout of the page) If the \"crossed\" and \"dotted\" conductors were\nrespectively the \"up\" and \"down\" turns of a single coil terminating in a\nsimple split commutator (Fig 69), when the coil had been revolved\nthrough an angle of 90° some of the up turns would be ascending and\nsome descending, so that conflicting currents would arise Yet we\nwant to utilize the whole surface of the drum; and by winding a\nnumber of coils in the manner hinted at, each coil, as it passes the\nzero point, top or bottom, at once generates a current in the desired\ndirection and reinforces that in all the other turns of its own and of\nother coils on the same side of a line drawn vertically through the\ncentre There is thus practically no fluctuation in the pressure of the\ncurrent generated The action of single and multiple coil windings may be compared\nto that of single and multiple pumps Water is ejected by a single\npump in gulps; whereas the flow from a pipe fed by several pumps\narranged to deliver consecutively is much more constant",
    "Water is ejected by a single\npump in gulps; whereas the flow from a pipe fed by several pumps\narranged to deliver consecutively is much more constant MULTIPOLAR DYNAMOS Hitherto we have considered the magnetic field produced by one\nbi-polar magnet only Large dynamos have four, six, eight, or more\nfield magnets set inside a casing, from which their cores project\ntowards the armature so as almost to touch it (Fig Large dynamos have four, six, eight, or more\nfield magnets set inside a casing, from which their cores project\ntowards the armature so as almost to touch it (Fig 74) The magnet\ncoils are wound to give N and S poles alternately at their armature\nends round the field; and the lines of force from each N pole stream\neach way to the two adjacent S poles across the path of the armature\ncoils In dynamos of this kind several pairs of collecting brushes pick\ncurrent off the commutator at equidistant points on its circumference Fig 74 Fig 74 —A Holmes continuous current dynamo: A,\narmature; C, commutator; M, field magnets EXCITING THE FIELD MAGNETS Until current passes through the field magnet coils, no magnetic\nfield can be created How are the coils supplied with current A\ndynamo, starting for the first time, is excited by a current from an\noutside source; but when it has once begun to generate current it\nfeeds its magnets itself, and ever afterwards will be self-exciting,[19]\nowing to the residual magnetism left in the magnet cores Fig 75 Fig 75 —Partly finished commutator Look carefully at Figs 77 and 78",
    "77 and 78 In the first of these you will\nobserve that part of the wire forming the external circuit is wound\nround the arms of the field magnet This is called a series winding In\nthis case all the current generated helps to excite the dynamo At the\nstart the residual magnetism of the magnet cores gives a weak field The armature coils cut this and pass a current through the circuit The\nmagnets are further excited, and the field becomes stronger; and so on\ntill the dynamo is developing full power Series winding is used where\nthe current in the external circuit is required to be very constant Series winding is used where\nthe current in the external circuit is required to be very constant Fig 76 Fig 76 —The brushes of a Holmes dynamo Fig 78 shows another method of winding—the shunt Most of the\ncurrent generated passes through the external circuit 2, 2; but a part is\nswitched through a separate winding for the magnets, denoted by the\nfine wire 1, 1 Here the strength of the magnetism does not vary\ndirectly with the current, as only a small part of the current serves the\nmagnets The shunt winding is therefore used where the voltage (or\npressure) must be constant The shunt winding is therefore used where the voltage (or\npressure) must be constant Fig 77 Fig 77 —Sketch showing a \"series\" winding Fig 7\nFig 78 78 —\"Shun\nA third method is a combination of the two already named A\nwinding of fine wire passes from brush to brush round the magnets;\nand there is also a series winding as in Fig",

    "79 Alternating current of 5,000 volts\npressure is produced in the generating station and sent through\nconductors to a distant station, where a transformer, B, reduces the\npressure to 500 volts to drive an alternating motor, C, which in turn\noperates a direct current dynamo, D This dynamo has its + terminal\nconnected with the insulated or \"live\" rail of an electric railway, and\nits – terminal with the wheel rails, which are metallically united at\nthe joints to act as a \"return \" On its way from the live rail to the\nreturn the current passes through the motors In the case of trams the\nconductor is either a cable carried overhead on standards, from which\nit passes to the motor through a trolley arm, or a rail laid\nunderground in a conduit between the rails In the top of the conduit\nis a slit through which an arm carrying a contact shoe on the end\nprojects from the car The shoe rubs continuously on the live rail as\nthe car moves To return for a moment to the question of transformation of\ncurrent \"Why,\" it may be asked, \"should we not send low-pressure\ndirect current to a distant station straight from the dynamo, instead of\naltering its nature and pressure Or, at any rate, why not use high-\npressure direct current, and transform that \" The answer is, that to\ntransmit a large amount of electrical energy at low pressure (or\nvoltage) would necessitate large volume (or amperage) and a big and\nexpensive copper conductor to carry it High-pressure direct current is\n\n\nnot easily generated, since the sparking at the collecting brushes as\nthey pass over the commutator segments gives trouble So engineers\nprefer high-pressure alternating current, which is easily produced, and\ncan be sent through a small and inexpensive conductor with little loss Also its voltage can be transformed by apparatus having no revolving\nparts THE ELECTRIC MOTOR Anybody who understands the dynamo will also be able to\nunderstand the electric motor, which is merely a reversed dynamo Imagine in Fig 70 a dynamo taking the place of the lamp and\npassing current through the brushes and commutator into the coil w x\ny z Now, any coil through which current passes becomes a magnet\nwith N and S poles at either end (In Fig 70 we will assume that the\nN pole is below and the S pole above the coil ) The coil poles\ntherefore try to seek the contrary poles of the permanent magnet, and\nthe coil revolves until its S pole faces the N of the magnet, and vice\nversâ The lines of force of the coil and the magnet are now parallel But the momentum of revolution carries the coil on, and suddenly the\ncommutator reverses its polarity, and a further half-revolution takes\nplace Then comes a further reversal, and so on ad infinitum The\nrotation of the motor is therefore merely a question of repulsion and\nattraction of like and unlike poles An ordinary compass needle may\nbe converted into a tiny motor by presenting the N",
    "An ordinary compass needle may\nbe converted into a tiny motor by presenting the N and S poles of a\nmagnet to its S and N and N poles alternately every half-revolution In construction and winding a motor is practically the same as a\ndynamo In fact, either machine can perform either function, though\nperhaps not equally well adapted for both Motors may be run with\ndirect or alternating current, according to their construction On electric cars the motor is generally suspended from the wheel\ntruck, and a small pinion on the armature shaft gears with a large\npinion on a wheel axle One great advantage of electric traction is that\nevery vehicle of a train can carry its own motor, so that the whole\nweight of the train may be used to get a grip on the rails when\nstarting Where a single steam locomotive is used, the adhesion of its\n\n\ndriving-wheels only is available for overcoming the inertia of the load;\nand the whole strain of starting is thrown on to the foremost\ncouplings Other advantages may be summed up as follows:—(1) Ease\nof starting and rapid acceleration; (2) absence of waste of energy (in\nthe shape of burning fuel) when the vehicles are at rest; (3) absence of\nsmoke and smell ELECTRIC LIGHTING Dynamos are used to generate current for two main purposes—(1)\nTo supply power to motors of all kinds; (2) to light our houses,\nfactories, and streets In private houses and theatres incandescent\nlamps are generally used; in the open air, in shops, and in larger\nbuildings, such as railway stations, the arc lamp is more often found INCANDESCENT LAMP If you take a piece of very fine iron wire and lay it across the\nterminals of an accumulator, it becomes white hot and melts, owing\nto the heat generated by its resistance to the current A piece of fine\nplatinum wire would become white hot without melting, and would\ngive out an intense light Here we have the principle of the glow or\nincandescent lamp—namely, the interposition in an electric circuit of\na conductor which at once offers a high resistance to the current, but\nis not destroyed by the resulting heat In Fig 80 is shown a fan propelling liquid constantly through a\npipe Let us assume that the liquid is one which develops great\nfriction on the inside of the pipe At the contraction, where the speed\nof travel is much greater than elsewhere in the circuit, most heat will\nbe produced",
    "At the contraction, where the speed\nof travel is much greater than elsewhere in the circuit, most heat will\nbe produced Fig 80 Fig 80 —Diagram to show circulation of water through\na pipe —Diagram to show circulation of water through\na pipe In quite the early days of the glow-lamp platinum wire was found\nto be unreliable as regards melting, and filaments of carbon are now\n\n\nused To prevent the wasting away of the carbon by combination with\noxygen the filament is enclosed in a glass bulb from which practically\nall air has been sucked by a mercury pump before sealing Fig 81 Fig 81 —The electrical counterpart of Fig 80 80 The\nfilament takes the place of the contraction in the pipe The manufacture of glow-lamps is now an important industry One\nbrand of lamp[20] is made as follows:—First, cotton-wool is dissolved\nin chloride of zinc, and forms a treacly solution, which is squirted\nthrough a fine nozzle into a settling solution which hardens it and\nmakes it coil up like a very fine violin string After being washed and\ndried, it is wound on a plumbago rod and baked in a furnace until\nonly the carbon element remains This is the filament in the rough It\nis next removed from the rod and tipped with two short pieces of fine\nplatinum wire To make the junction electrically perfect the filament\nis plunged in benzine and heated to whiteness by the passage of a\nstrong current, which deposits the carbon of the benzine on the joints The filament is now placed under the glass receiver of an air-pump,\nthe air is exhausted, hydro-carbon vapour is introduced, and the\nfilament has a current passed through it to make it white hot Carbon\nfrom the vapour is deposited all over the filament until the required\nelectrical resistance is attained The filament is now ready for\nenclosure in the bulb When the bulb has been exhausted and sealed,\nthe lamp is tested, and, if passed, goes to the finishing department,\nwhere the two platinum wires (projecting through the glass) are\nsoldered to a couple of brass plates, which make contact with two\nterminals in a lamp socket Finally, brass caps are affixed with a\nspecial water-tight and hard cement ARC LAMPS In arc lighting, instead of a contraction at a point in the circuit,\nthere is an actual break of very small extent Suppose that to the ends\nof the wires leading from a dynamo's terminals we attach two carbon\nrods, and touch the end of the rods together The tips become white\n\n\nhot, and if they are separated slightly, atoms of incandescent carbon\nleap from the positive to the negative rod in a continuous and\nintensely luminous stream, which is called an arc because the path of\nthe particles is curved No arc would be formed unless the carbons\nwere first touched to start incandescence If they are separated too far\nfor the strength of the current to bridge the gap the light will flicker\nor go out The arc lamp is therefore provided with a mechanism\nwhich, when the current is cut off, causes the carbons to fall together,\ngradually separates them when it is turned on, and keeps them apart The principle employed is the effort of a coil through which a current\npasses to draw an iron rod into its centre Some of the current feeding\nthe lamp is shunted through a coil, into which projects one end of an\niron bar connected with one carbon point A spring normally presses\nthe points together when no current flows As soon as current\ncirculates through the coil the bar is drawn upwards against the\nspring SERIES AND PARALLEL ARRANGEMENT OF LAMPS When current passes from one lamp to another, as in Fig 82, the\nlamps are said to be in series Should one lamp fail, all in the circuit\nwould go out But where arc lamps are thus arranged a special\nmechanism on each lamp \"short-circuits\" it in case of failure, so that\ncurrent may pass uninterruptedly to the next Fig 82 Fig 82 —Incandescent lamps connected in \"series\nFig 83 shows a number of lamps set in parallel One terminal of\neach is attached to the positive conductor, the other to the negative\nconductor Each lamp therefore forms an independent bridge, and\ndoes not affect the efficiency of the rest Parallel series signifies a\ncombination of the two systems, and would be illustrated if, in Fig 83, two or more lamps were connected in series groups from one\nconductor to the other This arrangement is often used in arc lighting Fig 83 Fig 83",

    "85) riding on\ntrunnions, E E, so that it may swing a little when the brakes are\napplied Inside the chamber is a cylinder, the piston of which is\nrendered air-tight by a rubber ring rolling between it and the cylinder\nwalls The piston rod works through an air-tight stuffing-box in the\nbottom of the casing, and when it rises operates the brake rods It is\nobvious that if air is exhausted from both sides of the piston at once,\nthe piston will sink by reason of its own weight and that of its\nattachments If air is now admitted below the piston, the latter will be\n\n\npushed upwards with a maximum pressure of 15 lbs to the square\ninch The ball-valve ensures that while air can be sucked from both\nsides of the piston, it can be admitted to the lower side only The ball-valve ensures that while air can be sucked from both\nsides of the piston, it can be admitted to the lower side only Fig 85 Fig 85 —Vacuum brake \"off \"\nFig 86 Fig 86 —Vacuum brake \"on \"\nLet us imagine that a train has been standing in a siding, and that\nair has gradually filled the vacuum chamber by leakage The engine is\ncoupled on, and the driver at once turns on the steam ejector,[21]\nwhich sucks all the air out of the pipes and chambers throughout the\ntrain The air is sucked directly from the under side of the piston\nthrough pipe D; and from the space A A and the cylinder (open at the\ntop) through the channel C, lifting the ball, which, as soon as\nexhaustion is complete, or when the pressure on both sides of the\npiston is equal, falls back on its seat On air being admitted to the\ntrain pipe, it rushes through D and into the space B (Fig 86) below\nthe piston, but is unable to pass the ball, so that a strong upward\npressure is exerted on the piston, and the brakes go on To throw\nthem off, the space below the piston must be exhausted This is to be\nnoted: If there is a leak, as in the case of the train parting, the brakes\ngo on at once, since the vacuum below the piston is automatically\nbroken",
    "This is to be\nnoted: If there is a leak, as in the case of the train parting, the brakes\ngo on at once, since the vacuum below the piston is automatically\nbroken Fig 87 Fig 87 87 —Guard's valve for applying the Vacuum\nbrake For ordinary stops the vacuum is only partially broken—that is, an\nair-pressure of but from 5 to 10 lbs per square inch is admitted For\nemergency stops full atmospheric pressure is used In this case it is\nadvisable that air should enter at both ends of the train; so in the\nguard's van there is installed an ingenious automatic valve, which can\nat any time be opened by the guard pressing down a lever, but which\nopens of itself when the train-pipe vacuum is rapidly destroyed In this case it is\nadvisable that air should enter at both ends of the train; so in the\nguard's van there is installed an ingenious automatic valve, which can\nat any time be opened by the guard pressing down a lever, but which\nopens of itself when the train-pipe vacuum is rapidly destroyed Fig 87 shows this device in section Seated on the top of an upright pipe is\na valve, A, connected by a bolt, B, to an elastic diaphragm, C, sealing\nthe bottom of the chamber D The bolt B has a very small hole bored\nthrough it from end to end When the vacuum is broken slowly, the\npressure falls in D as fast as in the pipe; but a sudden inrush of air\n\n\ncauses the valve A to be pulled off its seat by the diaphragm C, as the\nvacuum in D has not been broken to any appreciable extent Air then\nrushes into the train pipe through the valve It is thus evident that the\ndriver controls this valve as effectively as if it were on the engine These \"emergency\" valves are sometimes fitted to every vehicle of a\ntrain When a carriage is slipped, taps on each side of the coupling joint\nof the train pipe are turned off by the guard in the \"slip;\" and when he\nwishes to stop he merely depresses the lever E, gradually opening the\nvalve Under the van is an auxiliary vacuum chamber, from which the\nair is exhausted by the train pipe If the guard, after the slip has\nparted from the train, finds that he has applied his brakes too hard, he\ncan put this chamber into communication with the brake cylinder,\nand restore the vacuum sufficiently to pull the brakes off again When a train has come to rest, the brakes must be sucked off by the\nejector Until this has been done the train cannot be moved, so that it\nis impossible for it to leave the station unprepared to make a sudden\nstop if necessary THE WESTINGHOUSE AIR-BRAKE This system is somewhat more complicated than the vacuum,\nthough equally reliable and powerful Owing to the complexity of\ncertain parts, such as the steam air-pump and the triple-valve, it is\nimpossible to explain the system in detail; we therefore have recourse\nto simple diagrammatic sketches, which will help to make clear the\ngeneral principles employed The air-brake, as first evolved by Mr George Westinghouse, was a\nvery simple affair—an air-pump and reservoir on the engine; a long\npipe running along the train; and a cylinder under every vehicle to\nwork the brakes To stop the train, the high-pressure air collected in\nthe reservoir was turned into the train pipe to force out the pistons in\nthe coach cylinders, connected to it by short branch pipes One defect\nof this \"straight\" system was that the brakes at the rear of a long train\ndid not come into action until a considerable time after the driver\nturned on the air; and since, when danger is imminent, a very few\n\n\nseconds are of great importance, this slowness of operation was a\nserious fault Also, it was found that the brakes on coaches near the\nengine went on long before those more distant, so that during a quick\nstop there was a danger of the forward coaches being bumped by\nthose behind It goes without saying that any coaches which might\nbreak loose were uncontrollable Mr Westinghouse therefore patented\nhis automatic brake, now so largely used all over the world The brake\nensures practically instantaneous and simultaneous action on all the\nvehicles of a train of any length Fig 88 Fig 88 —Diagrammatic sketch of the details of the Westinghouse ai\nThe principle of the brake will be gathered from Figs 88 and 89 P\nis a steam-driven air-pump on the engine, which compresses air into a\nreservoir, A, situated below the engine or tender, and maintains a\npressure of from 80 to 90 lbs per square inch",

    "We have not represented the\nmeans whereby the valve is rendered sensitive to these changes, for\nthe reason given above Fig 89 Fig 89 —Brake \"on \"\nThe latest form of triple-valve includes a device which, when air is\nrapidly discharged from the train pipe, as in an emergency application\nof the brake, opens a port through which compressed air is also\nadmitted from the train pipe directly into D It will easily be\nunderstood that a double advantage is hereby gained—first, in\nutilizing a considerable portion of the air in the train pipe to increase\nthe available brake force in cases of emergency; and, secondly, in\nproducing a quick reduction of pressure in the whole length of the\npipe, which accelerates the action of the brakes with extraordinary\nrapidity It may be added that this secondary communication is kept open\nonly until the pressure in D is equal to that in the train pipe Then it is\ncut off, to prevent a return of air from B to the pipe An interesting detail of the system is the automatic regulation of\nair-pressure in the main reservoir by the air-pump governor (Fig 90) The governor is attached to the steam-pipe leading from the\nlocomotive boiler to the air-pump Steam from the boiler, entering at\nF, flows through valve 14 and passes by D into the pump, which is\nthus brought into operation, and continues to work until the pressure\nin the main reservoir, acting on the under side of the diaphragm 9,\nexceeds the tension to which the regulating spring 7 is set Any excess\nof pressure forces the diaphragm upwards, lifting valve 11, and\nallowing compressed air from the main reservoir to flow into the\nchamber C The air-pressure forces piston 12 downwards and closes\nsteam-valve 14, thus cutting off the supply of steam to the pump As\nsoon as the pressure in the reservoir is reduced (by leakage or use)\nbelow the normal, spring 7 returns diaphragm 9 to the position shown\nin Fig 90, and pin-valve 11 closes The compressed air previously\nadmitted to the chamber C escapes through the small port a to the\natmosphere The steam, acting on the lower surface of valve 14, lifts it\n\n\nand its piston to the position shown, and again flows to the pump,\nwhich works until the required air-pressure is again obtained in the\nreservoir",

and in the\nabsence of effective brakes, its successor ran into it The advent of the\nelectric telegraph, which put stations in rapid communication with\none another, proved of the utmost value to the safe working of\nrailways THE BLOCK SYSTEM Time limits were abolished and distance limits substituted A line\nwas divided into blocks, or lengths, and two trains going in the same\ndirection were never allowed on any one block at the same time The signal-posts carrying the movable arms, or semaphores, by\nmeans of which the signalman communicates with the engine-driver,\nare well known to us They are usually placed on the left-hand side of\nthe line of rails to which they apply, with their arms pointing away\nfrom the rails The side of the arms which faces the direction from\nwhich a train approaches has a white stripe painted on a red\nbackground, the other side has a black stripe on a white background The distant and other signal arms vary slightly in shape (Fig 91) A\ndistant signal has a forked end and a V-shaped stripe; the home and\nstarting signals are square-ended, with straight stripes When the arm\nstands horizontally, the signal is \"on,\" or at \"danger\"; when dropped, it\nis \"off,\" and indicates \"All right; proceed \" At the end nearest the post\nit carries a spectacle frame glazed with panes of red and green glass When the arm is at danger, the red pane is opposite a lamp attached\nto the signal post; when the arm drops, the green pane rises to that\nposition—so that a driver is kept as fully informed at night as during\nthe day, provided the lamp remains alight Fig 91 Fig 91 —Distant and home signals POSITION OF SIGNALS On double lines each set of rails has its own separate signals, and\ndrivers travelling on the \"up\" line take no notice of signals meant for\nthe \"down\" line Each signal-box usually controls three signals on each\nset of rails—the distant, the home, and the starting Their respective\npositions will be gathered from Fig 92, which shows a station on a\ndouble line Between the distant and the home an interval is allowed\nof 800 yards on the level, 1,000 yards on a falling gradient, and 600\nyards on a rising gradient The home stands near the approach end of\nthe station, and the starting at the departure end of the platform The\nlast is sometimes reinforced by an \"advance starting\" signal some\ndistance farther on It should be noted that the distant is only a caution signal, whereas\nboth home and starting are stop signals This means that when the\ndriver sees the distant \"on,\" he does not stop his train, but slackens\nspeed, and prepares to stop at the home signal He must, however, on\nno account pass either home or starting if they are at danger In short,\nthe distant merely warns the driver of what he may expect at the\nhome To prevent damage if a driver should overrun the home, it has\nbeen laid down that no train shall be allowed to pass the starting\nsignal of one box unless the line is clear to a point at least a quarter of\na mile beyond the home of the next box That point is called the\nstandard clearing point Technically described, a block is a length of line between the last\nstop signal worked from one signal-box and the first stop signal\nworked from the next signal-box in advance",

    "The instruments\nused vary on different systems, but the principle is the same; so we\nwill concentrate our attention on those most commonly employed on\nthe Great Western Railway They are:—(1 ) Two tapper-bell\ninstruments, connected with similar instruments in the adjacent boxes\non both sides Each of these rings one beat in the corresponding box\nevery time its key is depressed (2 ) Two Spagnoletti disc instruments\n—one, having two keys, communicating with the box in the rear; and\nthe other, in connection with the forward box, having no keys Their\nrespective functions are to give signals and receive them In the centre\nof the face of each is a square opening, behind which moves a disc\ncarrying two \"flags\"—\"Train on line\" in white letters on red ground,\nand \"Line clear\" in black letters on a white ground The keyed\ninstrument has a red and a white key When the red key is depressed,\n\"Train on line\" appears at the opening; also in that of a keyless disc at\nthe adjacent signal-box A depression of the white key similarly gives\n\"Line clear \" A piece of wire with the ends turned over and passed\nthrough two eyes slides over the keys, and can be made to hold either\ndown In addition to these, telephonic and telegraphic instruments are\nprovided to enable the signalmen to converse SERIES OF SIGNALLING OPERATIONS Fig 100 Fig 100 —The signaling instruments in three adjacent cabins The feat\ninstruments We may now watch the doings of signalmen in four successive\nboxes, A, B, C, and D, during the passage of an express train Signalman A calls signalman B's attention by one beat on the tapper-\nbell B answers by repeating it to show that he is attending A asks, \"Is\nline clear for passenger express \"—four beats on the bell B, seeing\nthat the line is clear to his clearing point, sends back four beats, and\npins down the white key of his instrument \"Line clear\" appears on the\nopening, and also at that of A's keyless disc A lowers starting signal Train moves off A gives two beats on the tapper = \"Train entering\nsection \" B pins indicator at \"Train on line,\" which also appears on A's\ninstrument A places signals at danger B asks C, \"Is line clear \" C\nrepeats the bell code, and pins indicator at \"Line clear,\" shown on B's\nkeyless disc also B lowers all signals Train passes B signals to C,\n\"Train entering section \" B signals to A, \"Train out of section,\" and\nreleases indicator, which returns to normal position with half of each\nflag showing at the window B signals to C, \"Train on line,\" and sets\nall his signals to danger C pins indicator to \"Train on line \" C asks, \"Is\nline clear \" But there is a train at station D, and signalman D therefore\ngives no reply, which is equivalent to a negative The driver, on\napproaching C's distant, sees it at danger, and slows down, stopping at\nthe home C lowers home, and allows train to proceed to his starting\nsignal D, when the line is clear to his clearing point, signals \"Line\nclear,\" and pins indicator at \"Line clear \" C lowers starting signals, and\ntrain proceeds C signals to D, \"Train entering section,\" and D pins\nindicator at \"Train on line \" C signals to B, \"Train out of section,\" sets\nindicator at normal, and puts signals at danger And so the process is\nrepeated from station to station Where, however, sections are short,\nthe signalman is advised one section ahead of the approach of a train\nby an additional signal signifying, \"Fast train approaching \" The block\nindicator reminds the signalman of the whereabouts of the train Unless his keyless indicator is at normal, he may not ask, \"Is line\nclear \" And until he signals back \"Line clear\" to the box behind, a train\nis not allowed to enter his section In this way a section of line with a\nfull complement of signals is always interposed between any two\ntrains THE WORKING OF SINGLE LINES We have dealt with the signalling arrangements pertaining to\ndouble lines of railway, showing that a system of signals is necessary\nto prevent a train running into the back of its predecessor Where\ntrains in both directions pass over a single line, not only has this\nelement of danger to be dealt with, but also the possibility of a train\nbeing allowed to enter a section of line from each end at the same time This is effected in several ways, the essence of each being that the\n\n\nengine-driver shall have in his possession visible evidence of the\npermission accorded him by the signalman to enter a section of single\nline A SINGLE TRAIN STAFF The simplest form of working is to allocate to the length of line a\n\"train staff\"—a piece of wood about 14 inches long, bearing the names\nof the stations at either end This is adopted where only one engine is\nused for working a section, such as a short branch line In a case like\nthis there is obviously no danger of two trains meeting, and the train\nstaff is merely the authority to the driver to start a journey No\ntelegraphic communication is necessary with such a system, and\nsignals are placed only at the ends of the line TRAIN STAFF AND TICKET On long lengths of single line where more than one train has to be\nconsidered, the line is divided into blocks in the way already\ndescribed for double lines, and a staff is assigned to each, the staffs for\nthe various blocks differing from each other in shape and colour The\nusual signals are provided at each station, and block telegraph\ninstruments are employed, the only difference being that one disc, of\nthe key pattern, is used for trains in both directions On such a line it\nis, of course, possible that two or more trains may require to follow\neach other without any travelling intermediately in the opposite\ndirection This would be impossible if the staff passed uniformly to\nand fro in the block section; but it is arranged by the introduction of a\ntrain staff ticket used in conjunction with the staff No train is permitted to leave a staff station unless the staff for the\nsection of line to be traversed is at the station; and the driver has the\nstrictest possible instructions that he must see the staff If a second\ntrain is required to follow, the staff is shown to the driver, and a train\nstaff ticket handed him as his authority to proceed If, however, the\nnext train over the section will enter from the opposite end, the staff\nis handed to the driver To render this system as safe as possible, train staff tickets are of\n\n\nthe same colour and shape as the staff for the section to which they\napply, and are kept in a special box at the stations, the key being\nattached to the staff and the lock so arranged that the key cannot be\nwithdrawn unless the box has been locked ELECTRIC TRAIN STAFF AND TABLET SYSTEMS These systems of working are developments of the last mentioned,\nby which are secured greater safety and ease in working the line On\nsome sections of single line circumstances often necessitate the\nrunning of several trains in one direction without a return train For\nsuch cases the train staff ticket was introduced; but even on the best\nregulated lines it is not always possible to secure that the staff shall be\nat the station where it is required at the right time, and cases have\narisen where, no train being available at the station where the staff\nwas, it had to be taken to the other station by a man on foot, causing\nmuch delay to traffic The electric train staff and tablet systems\novercome this difficulty Both work on much the same principle, and\nwe will therefore describe the former Fig 101 Fig 101 —An electric train staff holder: S S, staffs in the slot\nof the instrument Leaning against the side of the cabin is a\nstaff showing the key K at the end for unlocking a siding\npoints between two stations The engine driver cannot\nremove the staff until the points have been locked again At each end of a block section a train staff instrument (Fig 101) is\nprovided In the base of these instruments are a number of train staffs,\nany one of which would be accepted by an engine-driver as\npermission to travel over the single line The instruments are\nelectrically connected, the mechanism securing that a staff can be\nwithdrawn only by the co-operation of the signalman at each end of\nthe section; that, when all the staffs are in the instruments, a staff may\nbe withdrawn at either end; that, when a staff has been withdrawn,\n\n\nanother cannot be obtained until the one out has been restored to one\nor other of the instruments The safety of such a system is obvious, as\nalso the assistance to the working by having a staff available for a\ntrain no matter from which end it is to enter the section The mechanism of the instruments is quite simple A double-poled\nelectro-magnet is energized by the depression of a key by the\nsignalman at the further end of the block into which the train is to\nrun, and by the turning of a handle by the signalman who requires to\nwithdraw a staff The magnet, being energized, is able to lift a\nmechanical lock, and permits the withdrawal of a staff In its passage\nthrough the instrument the staff revolves a number of iron discs,\nwhich in turn raise or lower a switch controlling the electrical\nconnections This causes the electric currents actuating the electro-\nmagnet to oppose each other, the magnetism to cease, and the lock to\nfall back, preventing another staff being withdrawn It will naturally\nbe asked, \"How is the electrical system restored \" We have said that\nthere were a number of staffs in each instrument—in other words, a\ngiven number of staffs, usually twenty, is assigned to the section Assume that there are ten in each instrument, and that the switch in\neach is in its lower position Now withdraw a staff, and one\ninstrument has an odd, the other an even, number of staffs, and\nsimilarly one switch is raised while the other remains lowered,\ntherefore the electrical circuit is \"out of phase\"—that is, the currents\nin the magnets of each staff instrument are opposed to one another,\nand cannot release the lock The staff travels through the section and\nis placed in the instrument at the other end, bringing the number of\nstaffs to eleven—an odd number, and, what is more important, raising\nthe switch Both switches are now raised, consequently the electric\ncurrents will support each other, so that a staff may be withdrawn Briefly, then, when there is an odd number of staffs in one instrument\nand an even number in the other, as when a staff is in use, the\nsignalmen are unable to obtain a staff, and consequently cannot give\nauthority for a train to enter the section; but when there is either an\nodd or an even number of staffs in each instrument a staff may be\nwithdrawn at either end on the co-operation of the signalmen We may add that, where two instruments are in the same signal-\n\n\nbox, one for working to the box in advance, the other to the rear, it is\narranged that the staffs pertaining to one section shall not fit the\ninstrument for the other, and must be of different colours This\nprevents the driver accidentally accepting a staff belonging to one\nsection as authority to travel over the other INTERLOCKING The remarks made on the interlocking of points and signals on\ndouble lines apply also to the working of single lines, with the\naddition that not only are the distant, home, and starting signals\ninterlocked with each other, but with the signals and points governing\nthe approach of a train from the opposite direction—in other words,\nthe signals for the approach of a train to a station from one direction\ncannot be lowered unless those for the approach to the station of a\ntrain from the opposite direction are at danger, and the points\ncorrectly set SIGNALLING OPERATIONS In the working of single lines, as of double, the signalman at the\nstation from which a train is to proceed has to obtain the consent of\nthe signalman ahead, the series of questions to be signalled being very\nsimilar to those detailed for double lines There is, however, one\nnotable exception On long lengths of single line it is necessary to\nmake arrangements for trains to pass each other This is done by\nproviding loop lines at intervals, a second pair of rails being laid for\nthe accommodation of one train while another in the opposite\ndirection passes it To secure that more than one train shall not be on\na section of single line between two crossing-places it is laid down\nthat, when a signalman at a non-crossing station is asked to allow a\ntrain to approach his station, he must not give permission until he has\nnotified the signalman ahead of him, thus securing that he is not\nasking permission for trains to approach from both directions at the\nsame time Both for single and double line working a number of rules\ndesigned to deal with cases of emergency are laid down, the guiding\n\n\nprinciple being safety; but we have now dealt with all the conditions\nof everyday working, and must pass to the consideration of\nFig",
    "Both for single and double line working a number of rules\ndesigned to deal with cases of emergency are laid down, the guiding\n\n\nprinciple being safety; but we have now dealt with all the conditions\nof everyday working, and must pass to the consideration of\nFig 102 Fig 102 102 —An electric lever-frame in a signalling cabin at D\n\"POWER\" SIGNALLING In a power system of signalling the signalman is provided with\nsome auxiliary means—electricity, compressed air, etc —of moving\nthe signals or points under his control It is still necessary to have a\nlocking-frame in the signal-box, with levers interlocked with each\nother, and connections between the box and the various points and\nsignals But the frame is much smaller than an ordinary manual\nframe, and but little force is needed to move the little levers which\nmake or break an electric circuit, or open an air-valve, according to\nthe power-agent used ELECTRIC SIGNALLING Fig Fig 102 represents the locking-frame of a cabin at Didcot, England,\nwhere an all-electric system has been installed Wires lead from the\ncabin to motors situated at the points and signals, which they operate\nthrough worm gearing When a lever is moved it closes a circuit and\nsets the current flowing through a motor, the direction of the flow\n(and consequently of the motor's revolution) depending on whether\nthe lever has been moved forward or backward Indicators arranged\nunder the levers tell the signalman when the desired movements at\nthe points and signals have been completed If any motion is not\ncarried through, owing to failure of the current or obstruction of the\nworking parts, an electric lock prevents him continuing operations Thus, suppose he has to open the main line to an express, he is\nobliged by the mechanical locking-frame to set all the points correctly\nbefore the signals can be lowered He might move all the necessary\nlevers in due order, yet one set of points might remain open, and,\n\n\nwere the signals lowered, an accident would result But this cannot\nhappen, as the electric locks worked by the points in question block\nthe signal levers, and until the failure has been set right, the signals\nmust remain at \"danger \"\nThe point motors are connected direct to the points; but between a\nsignal motor and its arm there is an \"electric slot,\" consisting of a\npowerful electro-magnet which forms a link in the rod work To lower\na signal it is necessary that the motor shall revolve and a control\ncurrent pass round the magnet to give it the requisite attractive force If no control current flows, as would happen were any pair of points\nnot in their proper position, the motor can have no effect on the\nsignal arm to lower it, owing to the magnet letting go its grip Furthermore, if the signal had been already lowered when the control\ncurrent failed, it would rise to \"danger\" automatically, as all signals\nare weighted to assume the danger position by gravity The signal\ncontrol currents can be broken by the signalman moving a switch, so\nthat in case of emergency all signals may be thrown simultaneously to\ndanger PNEUMATIC SIGNALLING In England and the United States compressed air is also used to do\nthe hard labour of the signalman for him Instead of closing a circuit,\nthe signalman, by moving a lever half-way over, admits air to a pipe\nrunning along the track to an air reservoir placed beside the points or\nsignal to which the lever relates The air opens a valve and puts the\nreservoir in connection with a piston operating the points or signal-\narm, as the case may be This movement having been performed,\nanother valve in the reservoir is opened, and air passes back through\na second pipe to the signal-box, where it opens a third valve\ncontrolling a piston which completes the movement of the lever, so\nshowing the signalman that the operation is complete With\ncompressed air, as with electricity, a mechanical locking-frame is of\ncourse used AUTOMATIC SIGNALLING To reduce expense, and increase the running speed on lines where\nthe sections are short, the train is sometimes made to act as its own\nsignalman The rails of each section are all bonded together so as to\nbe in metallic contact, and each section is insulated from the two\nneighbouring sections At the further end of a section is installed an\nelectric battery, connected to the rails, which lead the current back to\na magnet operating a signal stationed some distance back on the\npreceding section As long as current flows the signal is held at \"All\nright \" When a train enters the section the wheels and axles short-\ncircuit the current, so that it does not reach the signal magnet, and\nthe signal rises to \"danger,\" and stays there until the last pair of\nwheels has passed out of the section Should the current fail or a\nvehicle break loose and remain on the section, the same thing would\nhappen The human element can thus be practically eliminated from\nsignalling To make things absolutely safe, a train should have\npositive control over a train following, to prevent the driver\noverrunning the signals On electric railways this has been effected by\nmeans of contacts working in combination with the signals, which\neither cut the current off from the section preceding that on which a\ntrain may be, or raise a trigger to strike an arm on the train following\nand apply its brakes Chapter XII OPTICS Lenses—The image cast by a convex lens—Focus—Relative\nposition of object and lens—Correction of lenses for colour—\nSpherical aberration—Distortion of image—The human eye—\nThe use of spectacles—The blind spot Light is a third form of that energy of which we have already\ntreated two manifestations—heat and electricity The distinguishing\ncharacteristic of ether light-waves is their extreme rapidity of\nvibration, which has been calculated to range from 700 billion\nmovements per second for violet rays to 400 billion for red rays If a beam of white light be passed through a prism it is resolved\ninto the seven visible colours of the spectrum—violet, indigo, blue,\ngreen, yellow, orange, and red—in this order The human eye is most\nsensitive to the yellow-red rays, a photographic plate to the green-\nviolet rays All bodies fall into one of two classes—(1) Luminous—that is, those\nwhich are a source of light, such as the sun, a candle flame, or a red-\nhot coal; and (2) non-luminous, which become visible only by virtue of\nlight which they receive from other bodies and reflect to our eyes THE PROPAGATION OF LIGHT Light naturally travels in a straight line It is deflected only when it\npasses from one transparent medium into another—for example, from\nair to water—and the mediums are of different densities We may\nregard the surface of a visible object as made up of countless points,\nfrom each of which a diverging pencil of rays is sent off through the\nether LENSES If a beam of light encounters a transparent glass body with non-\nparallel sides, the rays are deflected The direction they take depends\non the shape of the body, but it may be laid down as a rule that they\nare bent toward the thicker part of the glass The common burning-\nglass is well known to us We hold it up facing the sun to concentrate\n\n\nall the heat rays that fall upon it into one intensely brilliant spot,\nwhich speedily ignites any inflammable substance on which it may\nfall (Fig 103) We may imagine that one ray passes from the centre of\nthe sun through the centre of the glass This is undeflected; but all the\nothers are bent towards it, as they pass through the thinner parts of\nthe lens Fig 103 Fig 103 —Showing how a burning-glass concentrates the heat rays\nIt should be noted here that sunlight, as we call it, is accompanied\nby heat A burning-glass is used to concentrate the heat rays, not the\nlight rays, which, though they are collected too, have no igniting\neffect In photography we use a lens to concentrate light rays only Such\nheat rays as may pass through the lens with them are not wanted, and\nas they have no practical effect are not taken any notice of To be of\nreal value, a lens must be quite symmetrical—that is, the curve from\nthe centre to the circumference must be the same in all directions There are six forms of simple lenses, as given in Fig 104 Nos",
    "Nos 1\nand 2 have one flat and one spherical surface 1\nand 2 have one flat and one spherical surface Nos 3, 4, 5, 6 have two\nspherical surfaces When a lens is thicker at the middle than at the\nsides it is called a convex lens; when thinner, a concave lens The\nnames of the various shapes are as follows:—No 1, plano-convex; No 2, plano-concave; No 3, double convex; No 4, double concave; No 5,\nmeniscus; No 6, concavo-convex The thick-centre lenses, as we may\nterm them (Nos 1, 3, 5), concentrate a pencil of rays passing through\nthem; while the thin-centre lenses (Nos 2, 4, 6) scatter the rays (see\nFig 105) Fig 104 Fig 104 —Six forms of lenses THE CAMERA Fig 105 Fig 105 Fig 106 Fig 106 We said above that light is propagated in straight lines To prove\nthis is easy Get a piece of cardboard and prick a hole in it Set this up\nsome distance away from a candle flame, and hold behind it a piece of\ntissue paper You will at once perceive a faint, upside-down image of\nthe flame on the tissue Why is this Turn for a moment to Fig 106,\nwhich shows a \"pinhole\" camera in section At the rear is a ground-\nglass screen, B, to catch the image Suppose that A is the lowest point\nof the flame A pencil of rays diverging from it strikes the front of the\ncamera, which stops them all except the one which passes through the\nhole and makes a tiny luminous spot on B, above the centre of the\nscreen, though A is below the axis of the camera Similarly the tip of\nthe flame (above the axis) would be represented by a dot on the\nscreen below its centre And so on for all the millions of points of the\nflame If we were to enlarge the hole we should get a brighter image,\nbut it would have less sharp outlines, because a number of rays from\nevery point of the candle would reach the screen and be jumbled up\nwith the rays of neighbouring pencils Now, though a good, sharp\nphotograph may be taken through a pinhole, the time required is so\nlong that photography of this sort has little practical value What we\nwant is a large hole for the light to enter the camera by, and yet to\nsecure a distinct image If we place a lens in the hole we can fulfil our\nwish Fig 107 shows a lens in position, gathering up a number of rays\nfrom a point, A, and focussing them on a point, B If the lens has\n1,000 times the area of the pinhole, it will pass 1,000 times as many\nrays, and the image of A will be impressed on a sensitized\nphotographic plate 1,000 times more quickly Fig 107 Fig 107 THE IMAGE CAST BY A CONVEX LENS Fig 108 shows diagrammatically how a convex lens forms an\nimage From A and B, the extremities of the object, a simple ray is\n\n\nconsidered to pass through the centre of the lens This is not deflected\nat all Two other rays from the same points strike the lens above and\nbelow the centre respectively These are bent inwards and meet the\ncentral rays, or come to a focus with them at A1 and B1 In reality a\ncountless number of rays would be transmitted from every point of\nthe object and collected to form the image Fig 108 Fig 108 —Showing how an image is cast by a convex\nFOCUS We must now take special notice of that word heard so often in\nphotographic talk—\"focus \" What is meant by the focus or focal length\nof a lens Well, it merely signifies the distance between the optical\ncentre of the lens and the plane in which the image is formed Fig 109 Fig 109 We must here digress a moment to draw attention to the three\nsimple diagrams of Fig 109 The object, O, in each case is assumed to\nbe to the right of the lens In the topmost diagram the object is so far\naway from the lens that all rays coming from a single point in it are\npractically parallel These converge to a focus at F If the distance\nbetween F and the centre of the lens is six inches, we say that the lens\nhas a six-inch focal length The focal length of a lens is judged by the\ndistance between lens and image when the object is far away To\navoid confusion, this focal length is known as the principal focus, and\nis denoted by the symbol f In the middle diagram the object is quite\nnear the lens, which has to deal with rays striking its nearer surface at\nan acuter angle than before (reckoning from the centre) As the lens\ncan only deflect their path to a fixed degree, they will not, after\npassing the lens, come together until they have reached a point, F1,\nfurther from the lens than F The nearer we approach O to the lens,\nthe further away on the other side is the focal point, until a distance\nequal to that of F from the lens is reached, when the rays emerge from\nthe glass in a parallel pencil The rays now come to a focus no longer,\nand there can be no image If O be brought nearer than the focal\n\n\ndistance, the rays would diverge after passing through the lens RELATIVE POSITIONS OF OBJECT AND IMAGE Fig 110 Fig 110",
    "110 —Showing how the position of the image alters relatively to th\nFrom what has been said above we deduce two main conclusions—\n(1 ) The nearer an object is brought to the lens, the further away from\nthe lens will the image be (2 ) If the object approaches within the\nprincipal focal distance of the lens, no image will be cast by the lens To make this plainer we append a diagram (Fig 110), which shows\nfive positions of an object and the relative positions of the image (in\ndotted lines) First, we note that the line A B, or A B1, denotes the\nprincipal focal length of the lens, and A C, or A C1, denotes twice the\nfocal length We will take the positions in order:—\nPosition I Object further away than 2f Inverted image smaller than\nobject, at distance somewhat exceeding f Position II Object at distance = 2f Inverted image at distance =\n2f, and of size equal to that of object Position III Object nearer than 2f Inverted image further away than\n2f; larger than the object Position IV Object at distance = f As rays are parallel after passing\nthe lens no image is cast Position V Object at distance less than f No real image—that is,\none that can be caught on a focussing screen—is now given by the\nlens, but a magnified, erect, virtual image exists on the same side of\nthe lens as the object We shall refer to virtual images at greater length presently It is\nhoped that any reader who practises photography will now\nunderstand why it is necessary to rack his camera out beyond the\nordinary focal distance when taking objects at close quarters From\nFig 110 he may gather one practically useful hint—namely, that to\n\n\ncopy a diagram, etc , full size, both it and the plate must be exactly 2f\nfrom the optical centre of the lens And it follows from this that the\nfurther he can rack his camera out beyond 2f the greater will be the\npossible enlargement of the original CORRECTION OF LENSES FOR COLOUR We have referred to the separation of the spectrum colours of white\nlight by a prism Now, a lens is one form of prism, and therefore sorts\nout the colours In Fig 111 we assume that two parallel red rays and\ntwo parallel violet rays from a distant object pass through a lens A\nlens has most bending effect on violet rays and least on red, and the\nother colours of the spectrum are intermediately influenced For the\nsake of simplicity we have taken the two extremes only You observe\nthat the point R, in which the red rays meet, is much further from the\nlens than is V, the meeting-point of the violet rays A photographer\nvery seldom has to take a subject in which there are not objects of\nseveral different colours, and it is obvious that if he used a simple lens\nlike that in Fig 111 and got his red objects in good focus, the blue\nand green portions of his picture would necessarily be more or less\nout of focus Fig 111 Fig 111 Fig 112 Fig 112 This defect can fortunately be corrected by the method shown in\nFig 112 A compound lens is needed, made up of a crown glass convex\nelement, B, and a concave element, A, of flint glass For the sake of\nillustration the two parts are shown separated; in practice they would\nbe cemented together, forming one optical body, thicker in the centre\nthan at the edges—a meniscus lens in fact, since A is not so concave\nas B is convex Now, it was discovered by a Mr Hall many years ago\nthat if white light passed through two similar prisms, one of flint glass\n\n\nthe other of crown glass, the former had the greater effect in\nseparating the spectrum colours—that is, violet rays were bent aside\nmore suddenly compared with the red rays than happened with the\ncrown-glass prism Look at Fig 112 The red rays passing through the\nflint glass are but little deflected, while the violet rays turn suddenly\noutwards This is just what is wanted, for it counteracts the unequal\ninward refraction by B, and both sets of rays come to a focus in the\nsame plane Such a lens is called achromatic, or colourless If you hold\na common reading-glass some distance away from large print you will\nsee that the letters are edged with coloured bands, proving that the\nlens is not achromatic A properly corrected photographic lens would\nnot show these pretty edgings Colour correction is necessary also for\nlenses used in telescopes and microscopes SPHERICAL ABERRATION A lens which has been corrected for colour is still imperfect If rays\npass through all parts of it, those which strike it near the edge will be\nrefracted more than those near the centre, and a blurred focus results This is termed spherical aberration You will be able to understand the\nreason from Figs 113 and 114 Two rays, A, are parallel to the axis\nand enter the lens near the centre (Fig 113) These meet in one plane Two other rays, B, strike the lens very obliquely near the edge, and on\nthat account are both turned sharply upwards, coming to a focus in a\nplane nearer the lens than A If this happened in a camera the results\nwould be very bad Either A or B would be out of focus The trouble is\nminimized by placing in front of the lens a plate with a central\ncircular opening in it (denoted by the thick, dark line in Fig",
    "The trouble is\nminimized by placing in front of the lens a plate with a central\ncircular opening in it (denoted by the thick, dark line in Fig 114) The rays B of Fig 113 are stopped by this plate, which is therefore\ncalled a stop But other rays from the same point pass through the\nhole These, however, strike the lens much more squarely above the\ncentre, and are not unduly refracted, so that they are brought to a\nfocus in the same plane as rays A Fig 113 Fig 113 Fig 114 Fig 114 DISTORTION OF IMAGE Fig 115 Fig 115 —Section of a rectilinear lens The lens we have been considering is a single meniscus, such as is\nused in landscape photography, mounted with the convex side turned\ntowards the inside of the camera, and having the stop in front of it If\nyou possess a lens of this sort, try the following experiment with it Draw a large square on a sheet of white paper and focus it on the\nscreen The sides instead of being straight bow outwards: this is called\nbarrel distortion Now turn the lens mount round so that the lens is\noutwards and the stop inwards The sides of the square will appear to\nbow towards the centre: this is pin-cushion distortion For a long time\nopticians were unable to find a remedy Then Mr George S Cundell\nsuggested that two meniscus lenses should be used in combination,\none on either side of the stop, as in Fig 115 Each produces distortion,\nbut it is counteracted by the opposite distortion of the other, and a\nsquare is represented as a square Lenses of this kind are called\nrectilinear, or straight-line producing We have now reviewed the three chief defects of a lens—chromatic\naberration, spherical aberration, and distortion—and have seen how\nthey may be remedied So we will now pass on to the most perfect of\ncameras,\nTHE HUMAN EYE The eye (Fig 116) is nearly spherical in form, and is surrounded\noutside, except in front, by a hard, horny coat called the sclerotica (S) In front is the cornea (A), which bulges outwards, and acts as a\ntransparent window to admit light to the lens of the eye (C) Inside\nthe sclerotica, and next to it, comes the choroid coat; and inside that\nagain is the retina, or curved focussing screen of the eye, which may\nbest be described as a network of fibres ramifying from the optic\nnerve, which carries sight sensations to the brain The hollow of the\n\n\nball is full of a jelly-like substance called the vitreous humour; and the\ncavity between the lens and the cornea is full of water We have already seen that, in focussing, the distance between lens\nand image depends on the distance between object and lens Now, the\nretina cannot be pushed nearer to or pulled further away from its lens,\nlike the focussing screen of a camera How, then, is the eye able to\nfocus sharply objects at distances varying from a foot to many miles Fig 116 Fig 116 —Section of the human eye As a preliminary to the answer we must observe that the more\nconvex a lens is, the shorter is its focus We will suppose that we have\na box camera with a lens of six-inch focus fixed rigidly in the position\nnecessary for obtaining a sharp image of distant objects It so happens\nthat we want to take with it a portrait of a person only a few feet from\nthe lens If it were a bellows camera, we should rack out the back or\nfront But we cannot do this here So we place in front of our lens a\nsecond convex lens which shortens its principal focus; so that in effect\nthe box has been racked out sufficiently Nature, however, employs a much more perfect method than this",
    "Nature, however, employs a much more perfect method than this The eye lens is plastic, like a piece of india-rubber Its edges are\nattached to ligaments (L L), which pull outwards and tend to flatten\nthe curve of its surfaces The normal focus is for distant objects When\nwe read a book the eye adapts itself to the work The ligaments relax\nand the lens decreases in diameter while thickening at the centre,\nuntil its curvature is such as to focus all rays from the book sharply on\nthe retina If we suddenly look through the window at something\noutside, the ligaments pull on the lens envelope and flatten the\ncurves This wonderful lens is achromatic, and free from spherical\naberration and distortion of image Nor must we forget that it is aided\nby an automatic \"stop,\" the iris, the central hole of which is named the\npupil We say that a person has black, blue, or gray eyes according to\nthe colour of the iris Like the lens, the iris adapts itself to all\n\n\nconditions, contracting when the light is strong, and opening when\nthe light is weak, so that as uniform an amount of light as conditions\nallow may be admitted to the eye Most modern camera lenses are\nfitted with adjustable stops which can be made larger or smaller by\ntwisting a ring on the mount, and are named \"iris\" stops The image of\nanything seen is thrown on the retina upside down, and the brain\nreverses the position again, so that we get a correct impression of\nthings THE USE OF SPECTACLES Fig 117a Fig 117a Fig 117b Fig 117b Fig 118a Fig 118a Fig 118b Fig 118b",
    "118b The reader will now be able to understand without much trouble\nthe function of a pair of spectacles A great many people of all ages\nsuffer from short-sight For one reason or another the distance\nbetween lens and retina becomes too great for a person to distinguish\ndistant objects clearly The lens, as shown in Fig 117a, is too convex—\nhas its minimum focus too short—and the rays meet and cross before\nthey reach the retina, causing general confusion of outline This defect\nis simply remedied by placing in front of the eye (Fig 117b) a concave\nlens, to disperse the rays somewhat before they enter the eye, so that\nthey come to a focus on the retina If a person's sight is thus corrected\nfor distant objects, he can still see near objects quite plainly, as the\nlens will accommodate its convexity for them The scientific term for\nshort-sight is myopia Long-sight, or hypermetropia, signifies that the\neyeball is too short or the lens too flat Fig 118a represents the\nnormal condition of a long-sighted eye When looking at a distant\nobject the eye thickens slightly and brings the focus forward into the\nretina But its thickening power in such an eye is very limited, and\nconsequently the rays from a near object focus behind the retina It is\ntherefore necessary for a long-sighted person to use convex spectacles\nfor reading the newspaper As seen in Fig 118b, the spectacle lens\n\n\nconcentrates the rays before they enter the eye, and so does part of\nthe eye's work for it Returning for a moment to the diagram of the eye (Fig 116), we\nnotice a black patch on the retina near the optic nerve This is the\n\"yellow spot \" Vision is most distinct when the image of the object\nlooked at is formed on this part of the retina The \"blind spot\" is that\npoint at which the optic nerve enters the retina, being so called from\nthe fact that it is quite insensitive to light The finding of the blind\nspot is an interesting little experiment On a card make a large and a\nsmall spot three inches apart, the one an eighth, the other half an inch\nin diameter Bring the card near the face so that an eye is exactly\nopposite to each spot, and close the eye opposite to the smaller Now\ndirect the other eye to this spot and you will find, if the card be\nmoved backwards and forwards, that at a certain distance the large\nspot, though many times larger than its fellow, has completely\nvanished, because the rays from it enter the open eye obliquely and\nfall on the \"blind spot \"\nChapter XIII THE MICROSCOPE, THE TELESCOPE, AND THE MAGIC-LANTERN The simple microscope—Use of the simple microscope in the\ntelescope—The terrestrial telescope—The Galilean telescope\n—The prismatic telescope—The reflecting telescope—The\nparabolic mirror—The compound microscope—The magic-\nlantern—The bioscope—The plane mirror In Fig 119 is represented an eye looking at a vase, three inches\nhigh, situated at A, a foot away If we were to place another vase, B,\nsix inches high, at a distance of two feet; or C, nine inches high, at\nthree feet; or D, a foot high, at four feet, the image on the retina\n\n\nwould in every case be of the same size as that cast by A We can\ntherefore lay down the rule that the apparent size of an object depends\non the angle that it subtends at the eye Fig 119 Fig 119",
    "119 To see a thing more plainly, we go nearer to it; and if it be very\nsmall, we hold it close to the eye There is, however, a limit to the\nnearness to which it can be brought with advantage The normal eye\nis unable to adapt its focus to an object less than about ten inches\naway, termed the \"least distance of distinct vision \"\nTHE SIMPLE MICROSCOPE Fig 120 Fig 120 120 A magnifying glass comes in useful when we want to examine an\nobject very closely The glass is a lens of short focus, held at a\ndistance somewhat less than its principal focal length, F (see Fig 120), from the object The rays from the head and tip of the pin which\nenter the eye are denoted by continuous lines As they are deflected\nby the glass the eye gets the impression that a much longer pin is\nsituated a considerable distance behind the real object in the plane in\nwhich the refracted rays would meet if produced backwards (shown\nby the dotted lines) The effect of the glass, practically, is to remove it\n(the object) to beyond the least distance of distinct vision, and at the\nsame time to retain undiminished the angle it subtends at the eye, or,\nwhat amounts to the same thing, the actual size of the image formed\non the retina [22] It follows, therefore, that if a lens be of such short\nfocus that it allows us to see an object clearly at a distance of two\ninches—that is, one-fifth of the least distance of distinct vision—we\nshall get an image on the retina five times larger in diameter than\nwould be possible without the lens The two simple diagrams (Figs 121 and 122) show why the image\nto be magnified should be nearer to the lens than the principal focus,\nF We have already seen (Fig 109) that rays coming from a point in\n\n\nthe principal focal plane emerge as a parallel pencil These the eye\ncan bring to a focus, because it normally has a curvature for focussing\nparallel rays But, owing to the power of \"accommodation,\" it can also\nfocus diverging rays (Fig 121), the eye lens thickening the necessary\namount, and we therefore put our magnifying glass a bit nearer than F\nto get full advantage of proximity If we had the object outside the\nprincipal focus, as in Fig 122, the rays from it would converge, and\nthese could not be gathered to a sharp point by the eye lens, as it\ncannot flatten more than is required for focussing parallel rays Fig 121 Fig 121 Fig 122 Fig 122",
    "122 USE OF THE SIMPLE MICROSCOPE IN THE TELESCOPE Fig 123 Fig 123 Let us now turn to Fig 123 At A is a distant object, say, a hundred\nyards away B is a double convex lens, which has a focal length of\ntwenty inches We may suppose that it is a lens in a camera An\ninverted image of the object is cast by the lens at C If the eye were\nplaced at C, it would distinguish nothing But if withdrawn to D, the\nleast distance of distinct vision,[23] behind C, the image is seen\nclearly That the image really is at C is proved by letting down the\nfocussing screen, which at once catches it Now, as the focus of the\nlens is twice d, the image will be twice as large as the object would\nappear if viewed directly without the lens We may put this into a\nvery simple formula:—\nMagnification = focal length of lens\nd\n\n\nFig 124 Fig 124 In Fig 124 we have interposed between the eye and the object a\nsmall magnifying glass of 2½-inch focus, so that the eye can now\nclearly see the image when one-quarter d away from it B already\nmagnifies the image twice; the eye-piece again magnifies it four times;\nso that the total magnification is 2 × 4 = 8 times This result is\narrived at quickly by dividing the focus of B (which corresponds to\nthe object-glass of a telescope) by the focus of the eye-piece, thus:—\n20\n2½\n= 8\nThe ordinary astronomical telescope has a very long focus object-\nglass at one end of the tube, and a very short focus eye-piece at the\nother To see an object clearly one merely has to push in or pull out\nthe eye-piece until its focus exactly corresponds with that of the\nobject-glass THE TERRESTRIAL TELESCOPE An astronomical telescope inverts images This inversion is\ninconvenient for other purposes So the terrestrial telescope (such as is\ncommonly used by sailors) has an eye-piece compounded of four\nconvex lenses which erect as well as magnify the image Fig 125\nshows the simplest form of compound erecting eye-piece Fig 125 Fig 125 THE GALILEAN TELESCOPE Fig 126 Fig 126 A third form of telescope is that invented by the great Italian\nastronomer, Galileo,[24] in 1609 Its principle is shown in Fig",
    "Its principle is shown in Fig 126 126 The rays transmitted by the object-glass are caught, before coming to a\n\n\nfocus, on a concave lens which separates them so that they appear to\nmeet in the paths of convergence denoted by the dotted lines The\nimage is erect Opera-glasses are constructed on the Galilean\nprinciple THE PRISMATIC TELESCOPE In order to be able to use a long-focus object-glass without a long\nfocussing-tube, a system of glass reflecting prisms is sometimes\nemployed, as in Fig In order to be able to use a long-focus object-glass without a long\nfocussing-tube, a system of glass reflecting prisms is sometimes\nemployed, as in Fig 127 127 A ray passing through the object-glass is\nreflected from one posterior surface of prism A on to the other\nposterior surface, and by it out through the front on to a second prism\narranged at right angles to it, which passes the ray on to the\ncompound eye-piece The distance between object-glass and eye-piece\nis thus practically trebled The best-known prismatic telescopes are\nthe Zeiss field-glasses Fig 127 Fig 127 THE REFLECTING TELESCOPE We must not omit reference to the reflecting telescope, so largely\nused by astronomers The front end of the telescope is open, there\nbeing no object-glass Rays from the object fall on a parabolic mirror\nsituated in the rear end of the tube This reflects them forwards to a\nfocus In the Newtonian reflector a plane mirror or prism is situated in\nthe axis of the tube, at the focus, to reflect the rays through an eye-\npiece projecting through the side of the tube Herschel's form of\nreflector has the mirror set at an angle to the axis, so that the rays are\nreflected direct into an eye-piece pointing through the side of the tube\ntowards the mirror THE PARABOLIC MIRROR This mirror (Fig 128) is of such a shape that all rays parallel to the\naxis are reflected to a common point In the marine searchlight a\npowerful arc lamp is arranged with the arc at the focus of a parabolic\nreflector, which sends all reflected light forward in a pencil of parallel\nrays The most powerful searchlight in existence gives a light equal to\n\n\nthat of 350 million candles Fig 128 Fig 128 —A parabolic reflector THE COMPOUND MICROSCOPE We have already observed (Fig 110) that the nearer an object\napproaches a lens the further off behind it is the real image formed,\nuntil the object has reached the focal distance, when no image at all is\ncast, as it is an infinite distance behind the lens We will assume that a\ncertain lens has a focus of six inches We place a lighted candle four\nfeet in front of it, and find that a sharp diminished image is cast on a\nground-glass screen held seven inches behind it If we now exchange\nthe positions of the candle and the screen, we shall get an enlarged\nimage of the candle This is a simple demonstration of the law of\nconjugate foci—namely, that the distance between the lens and an\nobject on one side and that between the lens and the corresponding\nimage on the other bear a definite relation to each other; and an\nobject placed at either focus will cast an image at the other Whether\nthe image is larger or smaller than the object depends on which focus\nit occupies In the case of the object-glass of a telescope the image was\nat what we may call the short focus Fig 129 Fig 129",
    "129 —Diagram to explain the compound micros\nNow, a compound microscope is practically a telescope with the\nobject at the long focus, very close to a short-focus lens A greatly\nenlarged image is thrown (see Fig 129) at the conjugate focus, and\nthis is caught and still further magnified by the eye-piece We may\nadd that the object-glass, or objective, of a microscope is usually\ncompounded of several lenses, as is also the eye-piece THE MAGIC-LANTERN The most essential features of a magic-lantern are:—(1) The source\nof light; (2) the condenser for concentrating the light rays on to the\nslide; (3) the lens for projecting a magnified image on to a screen The most essential features of a magic-lantern are:—(1) The source\nof light; (2) the condenser for concentrating the light rays on to the\nslide; (3) the lens for projecting a magnified image on to a screen Fig 130 shows these diagrammatically The illuminant is most\ncommonly an oil-lamp, or an acetylene gas jet, or a cylinder of lime\nheated to intense luminosity by an oxy-hydrogen flame The natural\ncombustion of hydrogen is attended by a great heat, and when the\nsupply of oxygen is artificially increased the temperature of the flame\nrises enormously The nozzle of an oxy-hydrogen jet has an interior\npipe connected with the cylinder holding one gas, and an exterior,\nand somewhat larger, pipe leading from that containing the other, the\ntwo being arranged concentrically at the nozzle By means of valves\nthe proportions of the gases can be regulated to give the best results",
    "By means of valves\nthe proportions of the gases can be regulated to give the best results Fig 130 Fig 130 —Sketch of the elements of a magic-lante\nThe condenser is set somewhat further from the illuminant than the\nprincipal focal length of the lenses, so that the rays falling on them\nare bent inwards, or to the slide The objective, or object lens, stands in front of the slide Its position\nis adjustable by means of a rack and a draw-tube The nearer it is\nbrought to the slide the further away is the conjugate focus (see p 239), and consequently the image The exhibitor first sets up his\nscreen and lantern, and then finds the conjugate foci of slide and\nimage by racking the lens in or out If a very short focus objective be used, subjects of microscopic\nproportions can be projected on the screen enormously magnified During the siege of Paris in 1870–71 the Parisians established a\nballoon and pigeon post to carry letters which had been copied in a\nminute size by photography These copies could be enclosed in a quill\nand attached to a pigeon's wing On receipt, the copies were placed in\na special lantern and thrown as large writing on the screen Micro-\nphotography has since then made great strides, and is now widely\nused for scientific purposes, one of the most important being the study\nof the crystalline formations of metals under different conditions THE BIOSCOPE \"Living pictures\" are the most recent improvement in magic-lantern\nentertainments The negatives from which the lantern films are\nprinted are made by passing a ribbon of sensitized celluloid through a\nspecial form of camera, which feeds the ribbon past the lens in a\nseries of jerks, an exposure being made automatically by a revolving\nshutter during each rest The positive film is placed in a lantern, and\nthe intermittent movement is repeated; but now the source of\nillumination is behind the film, and light passes outwards through the\nshutter to the screen In the Urban bioscope the film travels at the rate\nof fifteen miles an hour, upwards of one hundred exposures being\nmade every second The impression of continuous movement arises from the fact that\nthe eye cannot get rid of a visual impression in less than one-tenth of\na second So that if a series of impressions follow one another more\nrapidly than the eye can rid itself of them the impressions will\noverlap, and give one of motion, if the position of some of the objects,\nor parts of the objects, varies slightly in each succeeding picture [25]\nTHE PLANE MIRROR Fig 131 Fig 131 This chapter may conclude with a glance at the common looking-\nglass Why do we see a reflection in it The answer is given\ngraphically by Fig 131 Two rays, A b, A c, from a point A strike the\nmirror M at the points b and c Lines b N, c O, drawn from these\npoints perpendicular to the mirror are called their normals The angles\nA b N, A c O are the angles of incidence of rays A b, A c The paths\nwhich the rays take after reflection must make angles with b N and c\nO respectively equal to A b N, A c O These are the angles of reflection If the eye is so situated that the rays enter it as in our illustration, an\nimage of the point A is seen at the point A1, in which the lines D b, E c\nmeet when produced backwards Fig 132 Fig 132",
    "132 When the vertical mirror is replaced by a horizontal reflecting\nsurface, such as a pond (Fig 132), the same thing happens The point\nat which the ray from the reflection of the spire's tip to the eye\nappears to pass through the surface of the water must be so situated\nthat if a line were drawn perpendicular to it from the surface the\nangles made by lines drawn from the real spire tip and from the\nobserver's eye to the base of the perpendicular would be equal [22] Glazebrook, \"Light,\" p 157 [23] Glazebrook, \"Light,\" p 157 [24] Galileo was severely censured and imprisoned for\ndaring to maintain that the earth moved round the sun, and\nrevolved on its axis [25] For a full account of Animated Pictures the reader\nmight advantageously consult \"The Romance of Modern\nInvention,\" pp 166 foll Chapter XIV SOUND AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS Nature of sound—The ear—Musical instruments—The vibration\nof strings—The sounding-board and the frame of a piano—\nThe strings—The striking mechanism—The quality of a note Sound differs from light, heat, and electricity in that it can be\npropagated through matter only Sound-waves are matter-waves, not\nether-waves This can be proved by placing an electric bell under the\nbell-glass of an air-pump and exhausting all the air Ether still remains\ninside the glass, but if the bell be set in motion no sound is audible Admit air, and the clang of the gong is heard quite plainly Sound resembles light and heat, however, thus far, that it can be\nconcentrated by means of suitable lenses and curved surfaces An echo\nis a proof of its reflection from a surface Before dealing with the various appliances used for producing\nsound-waves of a definite character, let us examine that wonderful\nnatural apparatus\nTHE EAR,\nthrough which we receive those sensations which we call sound Fig 133 Fig 133 —Diagrammatic sketch of the parts of the \nFig 133 is a purely diagrammatic section of the ear, showing the\nvarious parts distorted and out of proportion Beginning at the left, we\nhave the outer ear, the lobe, to gather in the sound-waves on to the\nmembrane of the tympanum, or drum, to which is attached the first of\na series of ossicles, or small bones The last of these presses against an\nopening in the inner ear, a cavity surrounded by the bones of the head Inside the inner ear is a watery fluid, P, called perilymph (\"surrounding\n\n\nwater\"), immersed in which is a membranic envelope, M, containing\nendolymph (\"inside water\"), also full of fluid Into this fluid project E E\nE, the terminations of the auditory nerve, leading to the brain When sound-waves strike the tympanum, they cause it to move\ninwards and outwards in a series of rapid movements The ossicles\noperated by the tympanum press on the little opening O, covered by a\nmembrane, and every time they push it in they slightly squeeze the\nperilymph, which in turn compresses the endolymph, which affects\nthe nerve-ends, and telegraphs a sensation of sound to the brain In Fig 134 we have a more developed sketch, giving in fuller\ndetail, though still not in their actual proportions, the components of\nthe ear The ossicles M, I, and S are respectively the malleus\n(hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup) Each is attached by\nligaments to the walls of the middle ear The tympanum moves the\nmalleus, the malleus the incus, and the incus the stapes, the last\npressing into the opening O of Fig 133, which is scientifically known\nas the fenestra ovalis, or oval window As liquids are practically\nincompressible, nature has made allowance for the squeezing in of the\noval window membrane, by providing a second opening, the round\nwindow, also covered with a membrane When the stapes pushes the\noval membrane in, the round membrane bulges out, its elasticity\nsufficing to put a certain pressure on the perilymph (indicated by the\ndotted portion of the inner ear)",
    "When the stapes pushes the\noval membrane in, the round membrane bulges out, its elasticity\nsufficing to put a certain pressure on the perilymph (indicated by the\ndotted portion of the inner ear) Fig 134 Fig 134 —Diagrammatic section of the ear, showing the va\nThe inner ear consists of two main parts, the cochlea—so called\nfrom its resemblance in shape to a snail's shell—and the semicircular\ncanals Each portion has its perilymph and endolymph, and contains a\nnumber of the nerve-ends, which are, however, most numerous in the\ncochlea We do not know for certain what the functions of the canals\nand the cochlea are; but it is probable that the former enables us to\ndistinguish between the intensity or loudness of sounds and the\ndirection from which they come, while the latter enables us to\ndetermine the pitch of a note In the cochlea are about 2,800 tiny\nnerve-ends, called the rods of Corti The normal ear has such a range\n\n\nas to give about 33 rods to the semitone The great scientist\nHelmholtz has advanced the theory that these little rods are like tiny\ntuning-forks, each responding to a note of a certain pitch; so that\nwhen a string of a piano is sounded and the air vibrations are\ntransmitted to the inner ear, they affect only one of these rods and the\npart of the brain which it serves, and we have the impression of one\nparticular note It has been proved by experiment that a very sensitive\near can distinguish between sounds varying in pitch by only 1⁄64th of\na semitone, or but half the range of any one Corti fibre This difficulty\nHelmholtz gets over by suggesting that in such an ear two adjacent\nfibres are affected, but one more than the other A person who has a \"good ear\" for music is presumably one whose\nCorti rods are very perfect Unlucky people like the gentleman who\ncould only recognize one tune, and that because people took off their\nhats when it commenced, are physically deficient Their Corti rods\ncannot be properly developed",
    "Their Corti rods\ncannot be properly developed What applies to one single note applies also to the elements of a\nmusical chord A dozen notes may sound simultaneously, but the ear\nis able to assimilate each and blend it with its fellows; yet it requires a\nvery sensitive and well-trained ear to pick out any one part of a\nharmony and concentrate the brain's attention on that part The ear has a much larger range than the eye \"While the former\nranges over eleven octaves, but little more than a single octave is\npossible to the latter The quickest vibrations which strike the eye, as\nlight, have only about twice the rapidity of the slowest; whereas the\nquickest vibrations which strike the ear, as a musical sound, have\nmore than two thousand times the rapidity of the slowest \"[26] To\ncome to actual figures, the ordinary ear is sensitive to vibrations\nranging from 16 to 38,000 per second The bottom and top notes of a\npiano make respectively about 40 and 4,000 vibrations a second Of\ncourse, some ears, like some eyes, cannot comprehend the whole\nscale The squeak of bats and the chirrup of crickets are inaudible to\nsome people; and dogs are able to hear sounds far too shrill to affect\nthe human auditory apparatus Not the least interesting part of this wonderful organ is the\n\n\ntympanic membrane, which is provided with muscles for altering its\ntension automatically If we are \"straining our ears\" to catch a shrill\nsound, we tighten the membrane; while if we are \"getting ready\" for a\ndeep, loud report like that of a gun, we allow the drum to slacken The Eustachian tube (Fig 134) communicates with the mouth Its\nfunction is probably to keep the air-pressure equal on both sides of\nthe drum When one catches cold the tube is apt to become blocked\nby mucus, causing unequal pressure and consequent partial deafness Before leaving this subject, it will be well to remind our more\nyouthful readers that the ear is delicately as well as wonderfully\nmade, and must be treated with respect Sudden shouting into the ear,\nor a playful blow, may have most serious effects, by bursting the\ntympanum or injuring the arrangement of the tiny bones putting it in\ncommunication with the inner ear MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS These are contrivances for producing sonorous shocks following\neach other rapidly at regular intervals Musical sounds are\ndistinguished from mere noises by their regularity If we shake a\nnumber of nails in a tin box, we get only a series of superimposed and\nchaotic sensations On the other hand, if we strike a tuning-fork, the\nair is agitated a certain number of times a second, with a pleasant\nresult which we call a note We will begin our excursion into the region of musical instruments\nwith an examination of that very familiar piece of furniture,\nTHE PIANOFORTE,\nwhich means literally the \"soft-strong \" By many children the piano is\nregarded as a great nuisance, the swallower-up of time which could be\nmuch more agreeably occupied, and is accordingly shown much less\nrespect than is given to a phonograph or a musical-box Yet the\nmodern piano is a very clever piece of work, admirably adapted for\nthe production of sweet melody—if properly handled The two forms\n\n\nof piano now generally used are the upright, with vertical sound-board\nand wires, and the grand, with horizontal sound-board [27]\nTHE VIBRATION OF STRINGS As the pianoforte is a stringed instrument, some attention should\nbe given to the subject of the vibration of strings A string in a state of\ntension emits a note when plucked and allowed to vibrate freely The\npitch of the note depends on several conditions:—(1) The diameter of\nthe string; (2) the tension of the string; (3) the length of the string; (4)\nthe substance of the string",
    "The\npitch of the note depends on several conditions:—(1) The diameter of\nthe string; (2) the tension of the string; (3) the length of the string; (4)\nthe substance of the string Taking them in order:—(1 Taking them in order:—(1 ) The number\nof vibrations per second is inversely proportional to the diameter of\nthe string: thus, a string one-quarter of an inch in diameter would\nvibrate only half as often in a given time as a string one-eighth of an\ninch in diameter (2 ) The length remaining the same, the number of\nvibrations is directly proportional to the square root of the tension:\nthus, a string strained by a 16-lb weight would vibrate four times as\nfast as it would if strained by a 1-lb weight (3 (3 ) The number of\nvibrations is inversely proportional to the length of the string: thus, a\none-foot string would vibrate twice as fast as a two-foot string,\nstrained to the same tension, and of equal diameter and weight (4 (4 )\nOther things being equal, the rate of vibration is inversely\nproportional to the square root of the density of the substance: so that\na steel wire would vibrate more rapidly than a platinum wire of equal\ndiameter, length, and tension These facts are important to remember\nas the underlying principles of stringed instruments Now, if you hang a wire from a cord, and hang a heavy weight\nfrom the wire, the wire will be in a state of high tension, and yield a\ndistinct note if struck But the volume of sound will be very small,\nmuch too small for a practical instrument The surface of the string\nitself is so limited that it sets up but feeble motions in the surrounding\nair Now hang the wire from a large board and strike it again The\nvolume of sound has greatly increased, because the string has\ntransmitted its vibrations to the large surface of the board To get the full sound-value of the vibrations of a string, we\nevidently ought to so mount the string that it may influence a large\n\n\nsounding surface In a violin this is effected by straining the strings\nover a \"bridge\" resting on a hollow box made of perfectly elastic\nwood Draw the bow across a string The loud sound heard proceeds\nnot from the string only, but also from the whole surface of the box THE SOUNDING-BOARD AND FRAME OF A PIANO A piano has its strings strained across a frame of wood or steel,\nfrom a row of hooks in the top of the frame to a row of tapering\nsquare-ended pins in the bottom, the wires passing over sharp edges\nnear both ends The tuner is able, on turning a pin, to tension its\nstrings till it gives any desired note Readers may be interested to\nlearn that the average tension of a string is 275 lbs , so that the total\nstrain on the frame of a grand piano is anything between 20 and 30\ntons To the back of the frame is attached the sounding-board, made of\nspruce fir (the familiar Christmas tree) This is obtained from Central\nand Eastern Europe, where it is carefully selected and prepared, as it\nis essential that the timber should be sawn in such a way that the\ngrain of the wood runs in the proper direction THE STRINGS These are made of extremely strong steel wire of the best quality If\nyou examine the wires of your piano, you will see that they vary in\nthickness, the thinnest being at the treble end of the frame It is found\nimpracticable to use wires of the same gauge and the same tension\nthroughout The makers therefore use highly-tensioned thick wires for\nthe bass, and finer, shorter wires for the treble, taking advantage of\nthe three factors—weight, tension, and length—which we have\nnoticed above The wires for the deepest notes are wrapped round\nwith fine copper wire to add to their weight without increasing their\ndiameter at the tuning-pins There are about 600 yards (roughly one-\nthird of a mile) of wire in a grand piano THE STRIKING MECHANISM We now pass to the apparatus for putting the strings in a state of\n\n\nvibration The grand piano mechanism shown in Fig",
    "The grand piano mechanism shown in Fig 135 may be\ntaken as typical of the latest improvements The essentials of an\neffective mechanism are:—(1) That the blow delivered shall be sharp\nand certain; (2) that the string shall be immediately \"damped,\" or\nhave its vibration checked if required, so as not to interfere with the\nsucceeding notes of other strings; (3) that the hammer shall be able to\nrepeat the blows in quick succession The hammer has a head of\nmahogany covered with felt, the thickness of which tapers gradually\nand regularly from an inch and a quarter at the bass end to three-\nsixteenths of an inch at the extreme treble notes The entire eighty-\nfive hammers for the piano are covered all together in one piece, and\nthen they are cut apart from each other The consistency of the\ncovering is very important If too hard, it yields a harsh note, and\nmust be reduced to the right degree by pricking with a needle In the\ndiagram the felt is indicated by the dotted part Fig 135 Fig 135 135 —The striking mechanism of a \"grand\" pia\nThe action carriage which operates the hammer is somewhat\ncomplicated When the key is depressed, the left end rises, and pushes\nup the whole carriage, which is pivoted at one end The hammer\nshank is raised by the jack B pressing upon a knob, N, called the\nnotch, attached to the under side of the shank When the jack has risen\nto a certain point, its arm, B1, catches against the button C and jerks it\nfrom under the notch at the very moment when the hammer strikes,\nso that it may not be blocked against the string As it rebounds, the\nhammer is caught on the repetition lever R, which lifts it to allow of\nperfect repetition The check catches the tail of the hammer head during its descent\nwhen the key is raised, and prevents it coming back violently on the\ncarriage and rest The tail is curved so as to wedge against the check\nwithout jamming in any way The moment the carriage begins to rise,\nthe rear end of the key lifts a lever connected with the damper by a\nvertical wire, and raises the damper of the string If the key is held\ndown, the vibrations continue for a long time after the blow; but if\nreleased at once, the damper stifles them as the hammer regains its\n\n\nseat A bar, L, passing along under all the damper lifters, is raised by\ndepressing the loud pedal The soft pedal slides the whole keyboard\nalong such a distance that the hammers strike two only out of the\nthree strings allotted to all except the bass notes, which have only one\nstring apiece, or two, according to their depth or length In some\npianos the soft pedal presses a special damper against the strings; and\na third kind of device moves the hammers nearer the strings so that\nthey deliver a lighter blow These two methods of damping are\nconfined to upright pianos A high-class piano is the result of very careful workmanship The\nmechanism of each note must be accurately regulated by its tiny\nscrews to a minute fraction of an inch It must be ensured that every\nhammer strikes its blow at exactly the right place on the string, since\non this depends the musical value of the note The adjustment of the\ndampers requires equal care, and the whole work calls for a sensitive\near combined with skilled mechanical knowledge, so that the\ninstrument may have a light touch, strength, and certainty of action\nthroughout the whole keyboard THE QUALITY OF A NOTE If two strings, alike in all respects and equally tensioned, are\nplucked, both will give the same note, but both will not necessarily\nhave the same quality of tone The quality, or timbre, as musicians call\nit, is influenced by the presence of overtones, or harmonics, in\ncombination with the fundamental, or deepest, tone of the string The\nfact is, that while a vibrating string vibrates as a whole, it also\nvibrates in parts There are, as it were, small waves superimposed on\nthe big fundamental waves Points of least motion, called nodes, form\non the string, dividing it into two, three, four, five, etc , parts, which\nmay be further divided by subsidiary nodes The string, considered as\nhalved by one node, gives the first overtone, or octave of the\nfundamental It may also vibrate as three parts, and give the second\novertone, or twelfth of the fundamental;[28] and as four parts, and\ngive the third overtone, the double octave Now, if a string be struck at a point corresponding to a node, the\n\n\novertones which require that point for a node will be killed, on\naccount of the excessive motion imparted to the string at that spot Thus to hit it at the middle kills the octave, the double octave, etc ;\nwhile to hit it at a point one-third of the length from one end stifles\nthe twelfth and all its sub-multiples A fundamental note robbed of all its harmonics is hard to obtain,\nwhich is not a matter for regret, as it is a most uninteresting sound To\nget a rich tone we must keep as many useful harmonics as possible,\nand therefore a piano hammer is so placed as to strike the string at a\npoint which does not interfere with the best harmonics, but kills those\nwhich are objectionable Pianoforte makers have discovered by\nexperiment that the most pleasing tone is excited when the point\nagainst which the hammer strikes is one-seventh to one-ninth of the\nlength of the wire from one end The nature of the material which does the actual striking is also of\nimportance The harder the substance, and the sharper the blow, the\nmore prominent do the harmonics become; so that the worker has to\nregulate carefully both the duration of the blow and the hardness of\nthe hammer covering [26] Tyndall, \"On Sound,\" p 75 [27] A Broadwood \"grand\" is made up of 10,700 separate\npieces, and in its manufacture forty separate trades are\nconcerned [28] Twelve notes higher up the scale Chapter XV WIND INSTRUMENTS Longitudinal vibration—Columns of air—Resonance of columns\nof air—Length and tone—The open pipe—The overtones of\n\n\nan open pipe—Where overtones are used—The arrangement\nof the pipes and pedals—Separate sound-boards—Varieties of\nstops—Tuning pipes and reeds—The bellows—Electric and\npneumatic actions—The largest organ in the world—Human\nreeds LONGITUDINAL VIBRATION In stringed instruments we are concerned only with the transverse\nvibrations of a string—that is, its movements in a direction at right\nangles to the axis of the string A string can also vibrate longitudinally\n—that is, in the direction of its axis—as may be proved by drawing a\npiece of resined leather along a violin string In this case the\nharmonics \"step up\" at the same rate as when the movements were\ntransverse Let us substitute for a wire a stout bar of metal fixed at one end\nonly The longitudinal vibrations of this rod contain overtones of a\ndifferent ratio The first harmonic is not an octave, but a twelfth While a tensioned string is divided by nodes into two, three, four,\nfive, six, etc , parts, a rod fixed at one end only is capable of\nproducing only those harmonics which correspond to division into\nthree, five, seven, nine, etc , parts Therefore a free-end rod and a wire\nof the same fundamental note would not have the same timbre, or\nquality, owing to the difference in the harmonics",
    "Therefore a free-end rod and a wire\nof the same fundamental note would not have the same timbre, or\nquality, owing to the difference in the harmonics COLUMNS OF AIR In wind instruments we employ, instead of rods or wires, columns\nof air as the vibrating medium The note of the column depends on its\nlength In the \"penny whistle,\" flute, clarionet, and piccolo the length\nof the column is altered by closing or opening apertures in the\nsubstance encircling the column RESONANCE OF COLUMNS OF AIR Why does a tube closed at one end, such as the shank of a key, emit\na note when we blow across the open end The act of blowing drives\n\n\na thin sheet of air against the edge of the tube and causes it to vibrate The vibrations are confused, some \"pulses\" occurring more frequently\nthan others If we blew against the edge of a knife or a piece of wood,\nwe should hear nothing but a hiss But when, as in the case which we\nare considering, there is a partly-enclosed column of air close to the\npulses, this selects those pulses which correspond to its natural period\nof vibration, and augments them to a sustained and very audible\nmusical sound But when, as in the case which we\nare considering, there is a partly-enclosed column of air close to the\npulses, this selects those pulses which correspond to its natural period\nof vibration, and augments them to a sustained and very audible\nmusical sound Fig 136 Fig 136 —Showing how the harmonics of a \"stopped\" pipe\nformed",
    "—Showing how the harmonics of a \"stopped\" pipe\nformed In Fig 136, 1 is a pipe, closed at the bottom and open at the top A\ntuning-fork of the same note as the pipe is struck and held over it so\nthat \nthe \nprongs \nvibrate \nupwards \nand \ndownwards At \nthe\ncommencement of an outward movement of the prongs the air in\nfront of them is compressed This impulse, imparted to the air in the\npipe, runs down the column, strikes the bottom, and returns Just as it\nreaches the top the prong is beginning to move inwards, causing a\nrarefaction of the air behind it This effect also travels down and back\nup the column of air in the pipe, reaching the prong just as it arrives\nat the furthest point of the inward motion The process is repeated,\nand the column of air in the pipe, striking on the surrounding\natmosphere at regular intervals, greatly increases the volume of\nsound We must observe that if the tuning-fork were of too high or too\nlow a note for the column of air to move in perfect sympathy with it,\nthis increase of sound would not result Now, when we blow across\nthe end, we present, as it were, a number of vibrating tuning-forks to\nthe pipe, which picks out those air-pulses with which it sympathizes LENGTH AND TONE The rate of vibration is found to be inversely proportional to the\nlength of the pipe Thus, the vibrations of a two-foot pipe are twice as\nrapid as those of a four-foot pipe, and the note emitted by the former\nis an octave higher than that of the latter A one-foot pipe gives a note\nan octave higher still We are here speaking of the fundamental tones\nof the pipes With them, as in the case of strings, are associated the\n\n\novertones, or harmonics, which can be brought into prominence by\nincreasing the pressure of the blast at the top of the pipe Blow very\nhard on your key, and the note suddenly changes to one much\nshriller It is the twelfth of the fundamental, of which it has\ncompletely got the upper hand We must now put on our thinking-caps and try to understand how\nthis comes about",
    "We must now put on our thinking-caps and try to understand how\nthis comes about First, let us note that the vibration of a body (in this\ncase a column of air) means a motion from a point of rest to a point of\nrest, or from node to node In the air-column in Fig 136, 1, there is\nonly one point of rest for an impulse—namely, at the bottom of the\npipe So that to pass from node to node the impulse must pass up the\npipe and down again The distance from node to node in a vibrating\nbody is called a ventral segment Remember this term Therefore the\npipe represents a semi-ventral segment when the fundamental note is\nsounding When the first overtone is sounded the column divides itself into\ntwo vibrating parts Where will the node between them be We might\nnaturally say, \"Half-way up \" But this cannot be so; for if the node\nwere so situated, an impulse going down the pipe would only have to\ntravel to the bottom to find another node, while an impulse going up\nwould have to travel to the top and back again—that is, go twice as\nfar So the node forms itself one-third of the distance down the pipe From B to A (Fig 136, 2) and back is now equal to from B to C When\nthe second overtone is blown (Fig 136, 3) a third node forms The\npipe is now divided into five semi-ventral segments And with each\nsucceeding overtone another node and ventral segment are added The law of vibration of a column of air is that the number of\nvibrations is directly proportional to the number of semi-ventral\nsegments into which the column of air inside the pipe is divided [29] If\nthe fundamental tone gives 100 vibrations per second, the first\novertone in a closed pipe must give 300, and the second 500\nvibrations THE OPEN PIPE A pipe open at both ends is capable of emitting a note But we shall\n\n\nfind, if we experiment, that the note of a stopped pipe is an octave\nlower than that of an open pipe of equal length This is explained by\nFig",
    "This is explained by\nFig 137, 1 137, 1 The air-column in the pipe (of the same length as that in\nFig 136) divides itself, when an end is blown across, into two equal\nportions at the node B, the natural point to obtain equilibrium A\npulse will pass from A or A1 to B and back again in half the time\nrequired to pass from A to B and back in Fig 136, 1; therefore the\nnote is an octave higher Fig 137 Fig 137 —Showing how harmonics of an open pipe are forme\nB1, and C are \"nodes \" The arrows indicate the distance travelled by a s\nimpulse from a node to a node THE OVERTONES OF AN OPEN PIPE The first overtone results when nodes form as in Fig 137, 2, at\npoints one-quarter of the length of the pipe from the ends, giving one\ncomplete ventral segment and two semi-ventral segments The\nvibrations now are twice as rapid as before The second overtone\nrequires three nodes, as in Fig 137, 3 The rate has now trebled So\nthat, while the overtones of a closed pipe rise in the ratio 1, 3, 5, 7,\netc , those of an open pipe rise in the proportion 1, 2, 3, 4, etc WHERE OVERTONES ARE USED In the flute, piccolo, and clarionet, as well as in the horn class of\ninstrument, the overtones are as important as the fundamental notes By artificially altering the length of the column of air, the\nfundamental notes are also altered, while the harmonics of each\nfundamental are produced at will by varying the blowing pressure; so\nthat a continuous chromatic, or semitonal, scale is possible\nthroughout the compass of the instrument THE ORGAN From the theory of acoustics[30] we pass to the practical\napplication, and concentrate our attention upon the grandest of all\nwind instruments, the pipe organ This mechanism has a separate pipe\nfor every note, properly proportioned A section of an ordinary\n\n\nwooden pipe is given in Fig 138",
    "138 Wind rushes up through the foot of\nthe pipe into a little chamber, closed by a block of wood or a plate\nexcept for a narrow slit, which directs it against the sharp lip A, and\ncauses a fluttering, the proper pulse of which is converted by the air-\ncolumn above into a musical sound Wind rushes up through the foot of\nthe pipe into a little chamber, closed by a block of wood or a plate\nexcept for a narrow slit, which directs it against the sharp lip A, and\ncauses a fluttering, the proper pulse of which is converted by the air-\ncolumn above into a musical sound Fig 138 Fig 138 —Section\nof an ordinary wooden\n\"flue\" pipe In even the smallest organs more than one pipe is actuated by one\nkey on the keyboard, for not only do pipes of different shapes give\ndifferent qualities of tone, but it is found desirable to have ranks of\npipes with their bottom note of different pitches The length of an\nopen pipe is measured from the edge of the lip to the top of the pipe;\nof a stopped pipe, from the lip to the top and back again When we\nspeak of a 16 or 8 foot rank, or stop, we mean one of which the\nlowest note in the rank is that produced by a 16 or 8 foot open pipe,\nor their stopped equivalents (8 or 4 foot) In a big organ we find 32,\n16, 8, 4, and 2 foot stops, and some of these repeated a number of\ntimes in pipes of different shape and construction THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PIPES We will now study briefly the mechanism of a very simple single-\nkeyboard organ, with five ranks of pipes, or stops",
    "We will now study briefly the mechanism of a very simple single-\nkeyboard organ, with five ranks of pipes, or stops Fig 139 Fig 139 —The table of a sound-board It is necessary to arrange matters so that the pressing down of one\nkey may make all five of the pipes belonging to it speak, or only four,\nthree, two, or one, as we may desire The pipes are mounted in rows\non a sound-board, which is built up in several layers At the top is the\nupper board; below it come the sliders, one for each stop; and\nunderneath that the table In Fig 139 we see part of the table from\nbelow Across the under side are fastened parallel bars with spaces\n(shown black) left between them Two other bars are fastened across\n\n\nthe ends, so that each groove is enclosed by wood at the top and on\nall sides The under side of the table has sheets of leather glued or\notherwise attached to it in such a manner that no air can leak from\none groove to the next Upper board, sliders, and table are pierced\nwith rows of holes, to permit the passage of wind from the grooves to\nthe pipes The grooves under the big pipes are wider than those under\nthe small pipes, as they have to pass more air The bars between the\ngrooves also vary in width according to the weight of the pipes which\nthey have to carry The sliders can be moved in and out a short\ndistance in the direction of the axis of the rows of pipes There is one\nslider under each row When a slider is in, the holes in it do not\ncorrespond with those in the table and upper board, so that no wind\ncan get from the grooves to the rank over that particular slider",

the two vocal cords represent the rubber edges; and the\narytenoid muscles stand instead of the hands When contracted, these\nmuscles bring the edges of the cords nearer to one another, stretch the\ncords, and shorten the cords A person gifted with a \"very good ear\"\ncan, it has been calculated, adjust the length of the vocal cords to\n1⁄17000th of an inch Simultaneously with the adjustment of the cords is effected the\nadjustment of the length of the windpipe, so that the column of air in\nit may be of the right length to vibrate in unison Here again is seen a\nwonderful provision of nature The resonance of the mouth cavity is also of great importance By\naltering the shape of the mouth the various harmonics of any\nfundamental note produced by the larynx are rendered prominent,\nand so we get the different vocal sounds Helmholtz has shown that\nthe fundamental tone of any note is represented by the sound oo If\nthe mouth is adjusted to bring out the octave of the fundamental, o\nresults a is produced by accentuating the second harmonic, the\ntwelfth; ee by developing the second and fourth harmonics; while for\nah the fifth and seventh must be prominent When we whistle we transform the lips into a reed and the mouth\ninto a pipe The tension of the lips and the shape of the mouth cavity\ndecide the note The lips are also used as a reed for blowing the flute,\npiccolo, and all the brass band instruments of the cornet order In\nblowing a coach-horn the various harmonics of the fundamental note\nare brought out by altering the lip tension and the wind pressure A\ncornet is practically a coach-horn rolled up into a convenient shape\nand furnished with three keys, the depression of which puts extra\nlengths of tubing in connection with the main tube—in fact, makes it\nlonger One key lowers the fundamental note of the horn half a tone;\nthe second, a full tone; the third, a tone and a half If the first and\nthird are pressed down together, the note sinks two tones; if the\nsecond and third, two and a half tones; and simultaneous depression\nof all three gives a drop of three tones The performer thus has seven\npossible fundamental notes, and several harmonics of each of these at\nhis command;

    "The limit rate is regulated by screw S THE PHONOGRAPH Though the recording and reproducing apparatus of a phonograph\ngives very wonderful results, its construction is quite simple At the\nsame time, it must be borne in mind that an immense amount of\nexperimenting has been devoted to finding out the most suitable\nmaterials and forms for the parts Fig 147 Fig 147 —Section of an Edison Bell phonograph reco\nThe recorder (Fig 147) is a little circular box about one and a half\ninches in diameter [32] From the top a tube leads to the horn The\nbottom is a circular plate, C C, hinged at one side This plate supports\na glass disc, D, about 1⁄150th of an inch thick, to which is attached the\ncutting stylus—a tiny sapphire rod with a cup-shaped end having very\nsharp edges Sound-waves enter the box through the horn tube; but\ninstead of being allowed to fill the whole box, they are concentrated\nby the shifting nozzle N on to the centre of the glass disc through the\nhole in C C You will notice that N has a ball end, and C C a socket to\nfit N exactly, so that, though C C and N move up and down very\nrapidly, they still make perfect contact The disc is vibrated by the\nsound-impulses, and drives the cutting point down into the surface of\nthe wax cylinder, turning below it in a clockwork direction The only\ndead weight pressing on S is that of N, C C, and the glass diaphragm Fig 148 Fig 148",
    "148 —Perspective view of a\nphonograph recorder As the cylinder revolves, the recorder is shifted continuously along\nby a leading screw having one hundred or more threads to the inch\ncut on it, so that it traces a continuous helical groove from one end of\nthe wax cylinder to the other This groove is really a series of very\nminute indentations, not exceeding 1⁄1000th of an inch in depth [33]\nSeen under a microscope, the surface of the record is a succession of\nhills and valleys, some much larger than others (Fig 151, a) 151, a) A loud\nsound causes the stylus to give a vigorous dig, while low sounds\nscarcely move it at all The wonderful thing about this sound-\nrecording is, that not only are the fundamental tones of musical notes\nimpressed, but also the harmonics, which enable us to decide at once\n\n\nwhether the record is one of a cornet, violin, or banjo performance Furthermore, if several instruments are playing simultaneously near\nthe recorder's horn, the stylus catches all the different shades of tone\nof every note of a chord There are, so to speak, minor hills and\nvalleys cut in the slopes of the main hills and valleys Fig 149 Fig 149 —Section of the reproducer of an Edison Bell pho\nFig 150 Fig 150 150 —Perspective view of a phonograph reproducer The reproducer (Fig 149) is somewhat more complicated than the\nrecorder As before, we have a circular box communicating with the\nhorn of the instrument A thin glass disc forms a bottom to the box It\nis held in position between rubber rings, R R, by a screw collar, C To\nthe centre is attached a little eye, from which hangs a link, L Pivoted\nat P from one edge of the box is a floating weight, having a circular\nopening immediately under the eye The link passes through this to\nthe left end of a tiny lever, which rocks on a pivot projecting from the\nweight To the right end of the lever is affixed a sapphire bar, or\nstylus, with a ball end of a diameter equal to that of the cutting point\nof the recorder The floating weight presses the stylus against the\nrecord, and also keeps the link between the rocking lever of the glass\ndiaphragm in a state of tension Every blow given to the stylus is\ntherefore transmitted by the link to the diaphragm, which vibrates\nand sends an air-impulse into the horn As the impulses are given at\nthe same rate as those which agitated the diaphragm of the recorder,\nthe sounds which they represent are accurately reproduced, even to\nthe harmonics of a musical note THE GRAMOPHONE This effects the same purpose as the phonograph, but in a\n\n\nsomewhat different manner The phonograph recorder digs vertically\ndownwards into the surface of the record, whereas the stylus of the\ngramophone wags from side to side and describes a snaky course (Fig 151b)",

inch on the pivot, shakes\nthe glass diaphragm and sends waves of air into the horn The gramophone is a reproducing instrument only The records are\nmade on a special machine, fitted with a device for causing the\nrecorder point to describe a spiral course from the circumference to\nthe centre of the record disc Some gramophone records have as many\nas 250 turns to the inch The total length of the tracing on a ten-inch\n\"concert\" record is about 1,000 feet THE MAKING OF RECORDS For commercial purposes it would not pay to make every record\n\n\nseparately in a recording machine The expense of employing good\nsingers and instrumentalists renders such a method impracticable All\nthe records we buy are made from moulds, the preparation of which\nwe will now briefly describe CYLINDER, OR PHONOGRAPH RECORDS First of all, a wax record is made in the ordinary way on a\nrecording machine After being tested and approved, it is hung\nvertically and centrally from a rotating table pivoted on a vertical\nmetal spike passing up through the record On one side of the table is\na piece of iron On each side of the record, and a small distance away,\nrises a brass rod enclosed in a glass tube The top of the rods are\nhooked, so that pieces of gold leaf may be suspended from them A\nbell-glass is now placed over the record, table, and rods, and the air is\nsucked out by a pump As soon as a good vacuum has been obtained,\nthe current from the secondary circuit of an induction coil is sent into\nthe rods supporting the gold leaves, which are volatilized by the\ncurrent jumping from one to the other A magnet, whirled outside the\nbell-glass, draws round the iron armature on the pivoted table, and\nconsequently revolves the record, on the surface of which a very thin\ncoating of gold is deposited The record is next placed in an\nelectroplating bath until a copper shell one-sixteenth of an inch thick\nhas formed all over the outside This is trued up on a lathe and\nencased in a brass tube The \"master,\" or original wax record, is\nremoved by cooling it till it contracts sufficiently to fall out of the\ncopper mould, on the inside surface of which are reproduced, in relief,\nthe indentations of the wax \"master \"\nCopies are made from the mould by immersing it in a tank of\nmelted wax The cold metal chills the wax that touches it, so that the\nmould soon has a thick waxen lining The mould and copy are\nremoved from the tank and mounted on a lathe, which shapes and\nsmooths the inside of the record The record is loosened from the\nmould by cooling After inspection for flaws, it is, if found\nsatisfactory, packed in cotton-wool and added to the saleable stock Gramophone master records are made on a circular disc of zinc,\ncoated over with a very thin film of acid-proof fat When the disc is\nrevolved in the recording machine, the sharp stylus cuts through the\nfat and exposes the zinc beneath On immersion in a bath of chromic\nacid the bared surfaces are bitten into, while the unexposed parts\nremain unaffected When the etching is considered complete, the plate\nis carefully cleaned and tested A negative copper copy is made from\nit by electrotyping This constitutes the mould From it as many as\n1,000 copies may be made on ebonite plates by combined pressure\nand heating [32] The Edison Bell phonograph is here referred to [33] Some of the sibilant or hissing sounds of the voice are\ncomputed to be represented by depressions less than a\nmillionth of an inch in depth Yet these are reproduced very\nclearly Chapter XVII WHY THE WIND BLOWS

slack through a slight leakage of\nair, and loses some of its bounce, it is a common practice to hold it for\na few minutes in front of the fire till it becomes temporarily taut\nagain Why does the heat have this effect on the ball No more air has\n\n\nbeen forced into the ball After perusing the chapter on the steam-\nengine the reader will be able to supply the answer \"Because the\nmolecules of air dash about more vigorously among one another when\nthe air is heated, and by striking the inside of the ball with greater\nforce put it in a state of greater tension \"\nIf we heat an open jar there is no pressure developed, since the air\nsimply expands and flows out of the neck But the air that remains in\nthe jar, being less in quantity than when it was not yet heated, weighs\nless, though occupying the same space as before If we took a very\nthin bladder and filled it with hot air it would therefore float in colder\nair, proving that heated air, as we should expect, tends to rise The\nfire-balloon employs this principle, the air inside the bag being kept\nartificially warm by a fire burning in some vessel attached below the\nopen neck of the bag Now, the sun shines with different degrees of heating power at\ndifferent parts of the world Where its effect is greatest the air there is\nhottest We will suppose, for the sake of argument, that, at a certain\nmoment, the air envelope all round the globe is of equal temperature Suddenly the sun shines out and heats the air at a point, A, till it is\nmany degrees warmer than the surrounding air The heated air\nexpands, rises, and spreads out above the cold air But, as a given\ndepth of warm air has less weight than an equal depth of cold air, the\ncold air at once begins to rush towards B and squeeze the rest of the\nwarm air out We may therefore picture the atmosphere as made up of\na number of colder currents passing along the surface of the earth to\nreplace warm currents rising and spreading over the upper surface of\nthe cold air A similar circulation takes place in a vessel of heated\nwater (see p 17) LAND AND SEA BREEZES A breeze which blows from the sea on to the land during the day\noften reverses its direction during the evening Why is this The earth\ngrows hot or cold more rapidly than the sea When the sun shines\nhotly, the land warms quickly and heats the air over it, which\n\n\nbecomes light, and is displaced by the cooler air over the sea When\nthe sun sets, the earth and the air over it lose their warmth quickly,\nwhile the sea remains at practically the same temperature as before So the balance is changed, the heavier air now lying over the land It\ntherefore flows seawards, and drives out the warmer air there LIGHT AIR AND MOISTURE Light, warm air absorbs moisture As it cools, the moisture in it\ncondenses Breathe on a plate, and you notice that a watery film\nforms on it at once The cold surface condenses the water suspended\nin the warm breath If you wish to dry a damp room you heat it Moisture then passes from the walls and objects in the room to the\natmosphere THE BAROMETER This property of air is responsible for the changes in weather Light, moisture-laden air meets cold, dry air, and the sudden cooling\nforces it to release its moisture, which falls as rain, or floats about as\nclouds If only we are able to detect the presence of warm air-strata\nabove us, we ought to be in a position to foretell the weather We can judge of the specific gravity of the air in our\nneighbourhood by means of the barometer, which means \"weight-\nmeasurer \" The normal air-pressure at sea-level on our bodies or any\nother objects is about 15 lbs to the square inch—that is to say, if you\ncould imprison and weigh a column of air one inch square in section\nand of the height of the world's atmospheric envelope, the scale would\nregister 15 lbs Many years ago (1643) Torricelli, a pupil of Galileo,\nfirst calculated the pressure by a very simple experiment He took a\nlong glass tube sealed at one end, filled it with mercury, and, closing\nthe open end with the thumb, inverted the tube and plunged the open\nend below the surface of a tank of mercury On removing his thumb\nhe found that the mercury sank in the tube till the surface of the\nmercury in the tube was about 30 inches in a vertical direction above\nthe surface of the mercury in the tank Now, as the upper end was\nsealed, there must be a vacuum above the mercury What supported\n\n\nthe column The atmosphere So it was evident that the downward\npressure of the mercury exactly counterbalanced the upward pressure\nof the air As a mercury column 30 inches high and 1 inch square\nweighs 15 lbs , the air-pressure on a square inch obviously is the\nsame Fig 152 Fig 152 —A Fortin\nbarometer FORTIN'S COLUMN BAROMETER\nis a simple Torricellian tube, T, with the lower end submerged in a\nlittle glass tank of mercury (Fig 152)",
    "152) The bottom of this tank is made\nof washleather To obtain a \"reading\" the screw S, pressing on the\nwashleather, is adjusted until the mercury in the tank rises to the tip\nof the little ivory point P The reading is the figure of the scale on the\nface of the case opposite which the surface of the column stands Fig 153 Fig 153 THE WHEEL BAROMETER\nalso employs the mercury column (Fig 153) The lower end of the\ntube is turned up and expanded to form a tank, C The pointer P,\nwhich travels round a graduated dial, is mounted on a spindle\ncarrying a pulley, over which passes a string with a weight at each\nend The heavier of the weights rests on the top of the mercury When\nthe atmospheric pressure falls, the mercury in C rises, lifting this\nweight, and the pointer moves This form of barometer is not so\ndelicate or reliable as Fortin's, or as the siphon barometer, which has\na tube of the same shape as the wheel instrument, but of the same\ndiameter from end to end except for a contraction at the bend The\nreading of a siphon is the distance between the two surfaces of the\nmercury A VERY SIMPLE BAROMETER\nis made by knocking off the neck of a small bottle, filling the body\n\n\nwith water, and hanging it up by a string in the position shown (Fig 154) When the atmospheric pressure falls, the water at the orifice\nbulges outwards; when it rises, the water retreats till its surface is\nslightly concave",
    "When the atmospheric pressure falls, the water at the orifice\nbulges outwards; when it rises, the water retreats till its surface is\nslightly concave Fig 154 Fig 154 THE ANEROID BAROMETER On account of their size and weight, and the comparative difficulty\nof transporting them without derangement of the mercury column,\ncolumn barometers are not so generally used as the aneroid variety Aneroid means \"without moisture,\" and in this particular connection\nsignifies that no liquid is used in the construction of the barometer Fig 155 shows an aneroid in detail The most noticeable feature is\nthe vacuum chamber, V C, a circular box which has a top and bottom\nof corrugated but thin and elastic metal Sections of the box are\nshown in Figs Sections of the box are\nshown in Figs 156, 157 156, 157 It is attached at the bottom to the base board\nof the instrument by a screw (Fig 156) From the top rises a pin, P,\nwith a transverse hole through it to accommodate the pin K E, which\nhas a triangular section, and stands on one edge Fig 155 Fig 155 —An aneroid barometer Returning to Fig 155, we see that P projects through S, a powerful\nspring of sheet-steel To this is attached a long arm, C, the free end of\nwhich moves a link rotating, through the pin E, a spindle mounted in\na frame, D The spindle moves arm F This pulls on a very minute\nchain wound round the pointer spindle B, in opposition to a\nhairspring, H S B is mounted on arm H, which is quite independent of\nthe rest of the aneroid Fig 156 Fig 156 The vacuum chamber of an aneroid barometer extended\nand compressed The vacuum chamber is exhausted during manufacture and sealed",
    "The vacuum chamber is exhausted during manufacture and sealed It would naturally assume the shape of Fig It would naturally assume the shape of Fig 157, but the spring S,\nacting against the atmospheric pressure, pulls it out As the pressure\nvaries, so does the spring rise or sink; and the slightest movement is\ntransmitted through the multiplying arms C, E, F, to the pointer A good aneroid is so delicate that it will register the difference in\npressure caused by raising it from the floor to the table, where it has a\ncouple of feet less of air-column resting upon it An aneroid is\ntherefore a valuable help to mountaineers for determining their\naltitude above sea-level BAROMETERS AND WEATHER We may now return to the consideration of forecasting the weather\nby movements of the barometer The first thing to keep in mind is,\nthat the instrument is essentially a weight recorder How is weather\nconnected with atmospheric weight In England the warm south-west wind generally brings wet\nweather, the north and east winds fine weather; the reason for this\nbeing that the first reaches us after passing over the Atlantic and\npicking up a quantity of moisture, while the second and third have\ncome overland and deposited their moisture before reaching us A sinking of the barometer heralds the approach of heated air—\nthat is, moist air—which on meeting colder air sheds its moisture So\nwhen the mercury falls we expect rain On the other hand, when the\n\"glass\" rises, we know that colder air is coming, and as colder air\ncomes from a dry quarter we anticipate fine weather It does not\nfollow that the same conditions are found in all parts of the world In\nregions which have the ocean to the east or the north, the winds\nblowing thence would be the rainy winds, while south-westerly winds\nmight bring hot and dry weather THE DIVING-BELL Water is nearly 773 times as heavy as air If we submerge a\nbarometer a very little way below the surface of a water tank, we\n\n\nshall at once observe a rise of the mercury column At a depth of 34\nfeet the pressure on any submerged object is 15 lbs to the square\ninch, in addition to the atmospheric pressure of 15 lbs per square\ninch—that is, there would be a 30-lb absolute pressure As a rule,\nwhen speaking of hydraulic pressures, we start with the normal\natmospheric pressure as zero, and we will here observe the practice",

    "178 —A diagrammatic representation of the circulatory syst\nThe heart, which forces the blood through the body, is a large\nmuscle (of about the size of the clenched fist) with four cavities These\nare respectively known as the right and left auricles, and the right and\nleft ventricles They are arranged in two pairs, the auricle uppermost,\nseparated by a fleshy partition Between each auricle and its ventricle\nis a valve, which consists of strong membranous flaps, with loose\nedges turned downwards The left-side valve is the mitral valve, that\nbetween the right auricle and ventricle the tricuspid valve The edges\nof the valves fall together when the heart contracts, and prevent the\npassage of blood Each ventricle has a second valve through which it\nejects the blood (That of the right ventricle has been shown double\nfor the sake of convenience )\nThe action of the heart is this:—The auricles and ventricles expand;\nblood rushes into the auricles from the channels supplying them, and\ndistends them and the ventricles; the auricles contract and fill the\nventricles below quite full (there are no valves above the auricles, but\nthe force of contraction is not sufficient to return the blood to the\nveins); the ventricles contract; the mitral and tricuspid valves close;\nthe valves leading to the arteries open; blood is forced out of the\nventricles THE BLOOD CHANNELS\nare of two kinds—(1) The arteries, which lead the blood into the\ncirculatory system; (2) the veins, which lead the blood back to the\nheart The arteries divide up into branches, and these again divide\ninto smaller and smaller arteries The smallest, termed capillaries\n(Latin, capillus, a hair), are minute tubes having an average diameter\nof 1⁄3000th of an inch These permeate every part of the body The\ncapillary arteries lead into the smallest veins, which unite to form\nlarger and larger veins, until what we may call the main streams are\nreached Through these the blood flows to the heart There are three main points of difference between arteries and\nveins In the first place, the larger arteries have thick elastic walls,\nand maintain their shape even when empty This elasticity performs\nthe function of the air-chamber of the force-pump When the\nventricles contract, driving blood into the arteries, the walls of the\nlatter expand, and their contraction pushes the blood steadily forward\nwithout shock The capillaries have very thin walls, so that fluids pass\nthrough them to and from the body, feeding it and taking out waste\nmatter The veins are all thin-walled, and collapse when empty Secondly, most veins are furnished with valves, which prevent blood\nflowing the wrong way These are similar in principle to those of the\nheart Arteries have no valves Thirdly, arteries are generally deeply\nset, while many of the veins run near the surface of the body Those\non the front of the arm are specially visible Place your thumb on\nthem and run it along towards the wrist, and you will notice that the\nveins distend owing to the closing of the valves just mentioned Arterial blood is red, and comes out from a cut in gulps, on account\nof the contraction of the elastic walls If you cut a vein, blue blood\nissues in a steady stream The change of colour is caused by the loss of\noxygen during the passage of the blood through the capillaries, and\nthe absorption of carbon dioxide from the tissues The lungs are two of the great purifiers of the blood As it circulates\nthrough them, it gives up the carbon dioxide which it has absorbed,\nand receives pure oxygen in exchange If the air of a room is \"foul,\"\nthe blood does not get the proper amount of oxygen For this reason it\n\n\nis advisable for us to keep the windows of our rooms open as much as\npossible both day and night Fatigue is caused by the accumulation of\ncarbon dioxide and other impurities in the blood When we run, the\nheart pumps blood through the lungs faster than they can purify it,\nand eventually our muscles become poisoned to such an extent that\nwe have to stop from sheer exhaustion THE COURSE OF THE BLOOD It takes rather less than a minute for a drop of blood to circulate\nfrom the heart through the whole system and back to the heart We may briefly summarize the course of the circulation of the\nblood thus:—It is expelled from the left ventricle into the aorta and\nthe main arteries, whence it passes into the smaller arteries, and\nthence into the capillaries of the brain, stomach, kidneys, etc It here\nimparts oxygen to the body, and takes in impurities It then enters the\nveins, and through them flows back to the right auricle; is driven into\nthe right ventricle; is expelled into the pulmonary (lung) arteries;\nenters the lungs, and is purified It returns to the left auricle through\nthe pulmonary veins; enters the left auricle, passes to left ventricle, and\nso on A healthy heart beats from 120 times per minute in a one-year-old\ninfant to 60 per minute in a very aged person The normal rate for a\nmiddle-aged adult is from 80 to 70 beats Heart disease signifies the failure of the heart valves to close\nproperly Blood passes back when the heart contracts, and the\ncirculation is much enfeebled By listening through a stethoscope the\ndoctor is able to tell whether the valves are in good order A hissing\nsound during the beat indicates a leakage past the valves; a thump, or\n\"clack,\" that they shut completely THE HYDRAULIC PRESS It is a characteristic of fluids and gases that if pressure be brought\nto bear on any part of a mass of either class of bodies it is transmitted\nequally and undiminished in all directions, and acts with the same\n\n\nforce on all equal surfaces, at right angles to those surfaces The great\nnatural philosopher Pascal first formulated this remarkable fact, of\nwhich a simple illustration is given in Fig",
    "The great\nnatural philosopher Pascal first formulated this remarkable fact, of\nwhich a simple illustration is given in Fig 179 Two cylinders, A and\nB, having a bore of one and two inches respectively, are connected by\na pipe Water is poured in, and pistons fitting the cylinders accurately\nand of equal weight are inserted On piston B is placed a load of 10\nlbs To prevent A rising above the level of B, it must be loaded\nproportionately The area of piston A is four times that of B, so that if\nwe lay on it a 40-lb weight, neither piston will move The walls of the\ncylinders and connecting pipe are also pressed outwards in the ratio\nof 10 lbs for every part of their interior surface which has an area\nequal to that of piston B for every part of their interior surface which has an area\nequal to that of piston B Fig 179 Fig 179 Fig 180 Fig 180 —The cylinder and ram of a hydraulic press The hydraulic press is an application of this law Cylinder B is\nrepresented by a force pump of small bore, capable of delivering\nwater at very high pressures (up to 10 tons per square inch) In the\nplace of A we have a stout cylinder with a solid plunger, P (Fig 180),\ncarrying the table on which the object to be pressed is placed Bramah,\nthe inventor of the hydraulic press, experienced great difficulty in\npreventing the escape of water between the top of the cylinder and\nthe plunger If a \"gland\" packing of the type found in steam-cylinders\nwere used, it failed to hold back the water unless it were screwed\ndown so tightly as to jam the plunger He tried all kinds of expedients\nwithout success; and his invention, excellent though it was in\nprinciple, seemed doomed to failure, when his foreman, Henry\nMaudslay,[35] solved the problem in a simple but most masterly\nmanner He had a recess turned in the neck of the cylinder at the\npoint formerly occupied by the stuffing-box, and into this a leather\ncollar of U-section (marked solid black in Fig 180) was placed with\nits open side downwards When water reached it, it forced the edges\n\n\napart, one against the plunger, the other against the walls of the\nrecess, with a degree of tightness proportionate to the pressure On\nwater being released from the cylinder the collar collapsed, allowing\nthe plunger to sink without friction The principle of the hydraulic press is employed in lifts; in\nmachines for bending, drilling, and riveting steel plates, or forcing\nwheels on or off their axles; for advancing the \"boring shield\" of a\ntunnel; and for other purposes too numerous to mention HOUSEHOLD WATER-SUPPLY FITTINGS Among these, the most used is the tap, or cock When a house is\nserved by the town or district water supply, the fitting of proper taps\non all pipes connected with the supply is stipulated for by the water-\nworks authorities The old-fashioned \"plug\" tap is unsuitable for\ncontrolling high-pressure water on account of the suddenness with\nwhich it checks the flow Lest the reader should have doubts as to the\nnature of a plug tap, we may add that it has a tapering cone of metal\nworking in a tapering socket On the cone being turned till a hole\nthrough it is brought into line with the channel of the tap, water\npasses A quarter turn closes the tap Fig 181 Fig 181 —A screw-down water cock Its place has been taken by the screw-down cock A very common\nand effective pattern is shown in Fig",

    "185 The most useful form of household filter is one which can be\nattached to a tap connected with the main Such a filter is usually\nmade of porcelain or biscuit china The Berkefeld filter has an outer\ncase of iron, and an interior hollow \"candle\" of porcelain from which a\ntube passes through the lid of the filter to a storage tank for the\nfiltered water The water from the main enters the outer case, and\npercolates through the porcelain walls to the internal cavity and\nthence flows away through the delivery pipe Whatever be the type of filter used it must be cleansed at proper\nintervals A foul filter is very dangerous to those who drink the water\nfrom it It has been proved by tests that, so far from purifying the\nwater, an inefficient and contaminated filter passes out water much\nmore highly charged with microbes than it was before it entered We\nmust not therefore think that, because water has been filtered, it is\nnecessarily safe The reverse is only too often the case GAS TRAPS Dangerous microbes can be breathed as well as drunk into the\nhuman system Every communication between house and drains\nshould be most carefully \"trapped \" The principle of a gas trap\nbetween, say, a kitchen sink and the drain to carry off the water is\ngiven in Fig \" The principle of a gas trap\nbetween, say, a kitchen sink and the drain to carry off the water is\ngiven in Fig 186",

    "A nozzle is so arranged as to direct water on the buckets\njust as they reach the lowest point of a revolution (see Fig 188) The\nwater strikes the bucket on the partition between the two cups, which\nturns it right and left round the inside of the cups The change of\ndirection transfers the energy of the water to the wheel Fig 189 Fig 189 —Speed regulator for Pelton wheel The speed of the wheel may be automatically regulated by a\n\n\ndeflecting nozzle (Fig 189), which has a ball and socket joint to\npermit of its being raised or lowered by a centrifugal governor, thus\nthrowing the stream on or off the buckets The power of the wheel is\nconsequently increased or diminished to meet the change of load, and\na constant speed is maintained When it is necessary to waste as little\nwater as possible, a concentric tapered needle may be fitted inside the\nnozzle When the nozzle is in its highest position the needle tip is\nwithdrawn; as the nozzle sinks the needle protrudes, gradually\ndecreasing the discharge area of the nozzle Pelton wheels are designed to run at all speeds and to use water of\nany pressure At Manitou, Colorado, is an installation of three wheels\noperated by water which leaves the nozzle at the enormous pressure\nof 935 lbs per square inch It is interesting to note that jets of very\nhigh-pressure water offer astonishing resistance to any attempt to\ndeflect their course A three-inch jet of 500-lb water cannot be cut\nthrough by a blow from a crowbar In order to get sufficient pressure for working hydraulic machinery\nin mines, factories, etc , water is often led for many miles in flumes,\nor artificial channels, along the sides of valleys from the source of\nsupply to the point at which it is to be used By the time that point is\nreached the difference between the gradients of the flume and of the\nvalley bottom has produced a difference in height of some hundreds\nof feet Fig 190 Fig 190 —The Laxey water-wheel, Isle of Man In the top right-hand co\nis a Pelton wheel of proportionate size required to do the same amoun\nwork with the same consumption of water at the same pressure The full-page illustration on p 380 affords a striking testimony to\nthe wonderful progress made in engineering practice during the last\nfifty years The huge water-wheel which forms the bulk of the picture\nis that at Laxey, in the Isle of Man It is 72½ feet in diameter, and is\nsupposed to develop 150 horse-power, which is transmitted several\n\n\nhundreds of feet by means of wooden rods supported at regular\nintervals The power thus transmitted operates a system of pumps in a\nlead mine, raising 250 gallons of water per minute, to an elevation of\n1,200 feet The driving water is brought some distance to the wheel in\nan underground conduit, and is carried up the masonry tower by\npressure, flowing over the top into the buckets on the circumference\nof the wheel The little cut in the upper corner represents a Pelton wheel drawn\non the same scale, which, given an equal supply of water at the same\npressure, would develop the same power as the Laxey monster By the\nside of the giant the other appears a mere toy THE CREAM SEPARATOR",
    "THE CREAM SEPARATOR In 1864 Denmark went to war with Germany, and emerged from\nthe short struggle shorn of the provinces of Lauenburg, Holstein, and\nSchleswig The loss of the two last, the fairest and most fertile districts\nof the kingdom, was indeed grievous The Danish king now ruled only\nover a land consisting largely of moor, marsh, and dunes, apparently\nworthless for any purpose But the Danes, with admirable courage,\nentered upon a second struggle, this time with nature They made\nroads and railways, dug irrigation ditches, and planted forest trees;\nand so gradually turned large tracts of what had been useless country\ninto valuable possessions Agriculture being much depressed, owing to\nthe low price of corn, they next gave their attention to the\nimprovement of dairy farming Labour-saving machinery of all kinds\nwas introduced, none more important than the device for separating\nthe fatty from the watery constituents of milk It would not be too\nmuch to say that the separator is largely responsible for the present\nprosperity of Denmark Fig 191 Fig 191 —Section of a Cream Separator How does it work asks the reader Centrifugal force[37] is the\ngoverning principle To explain its application we append a sectional\nillustration (Fig 191) of Messrs Burmeister and Wain's hand-power\nseparator, which may be taken as generally representative of this class\nof machines Inside a circular casing is a cylindrical bowl, D, mounted\non a shaft which can be revolved 5,000 times a minute by means of\nthe cog-wheels and the screw thread chased on it near the bottom\nextremity Milk flows from the reservoir R (supported on a stout arm)\nthrough tap A into a little distributer on the top of the separator, and\nfrom it drops into the central tube C of the bowl Falling to the\nbottom, it is flung outwards by centrifugal force, finds an escape\nupwards through the holes a a, and climbs up the perforated grid e,\nthe surface of which is a series of pyramidical excrescences, and\nfinally reaches the inner surface of the drum proper The velocity of\nrotation is so tremendous that the heavier portions of the milk—that\nis, the watery—crowd towards the point furthest from the centre, and\nkeep the lighter fatty elements away from contact with the sides of\nthe drum In the diagram the water is represented by small circles, the\ncream by small crosses As more milk enters the drum it forces upwards what is already\nthere The cap of the drum has an inner jacket, F, which at the bottom\nall but touches the side of the drum The distance between them is the\nmerest slit; but the cream is deflected up outside F into space E, and\nescapes through a hole one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter\nperforating the plate G The cream is flung into space K and trickles\nout of spout B, while the water flies into space H and trickles away\nthrough spout A THE \"HYDRO ,\"\nused in laundries for wringing clothes by centrifugal force, has a solid\nouter casing and an inner perforated cylindrical cage, revolved at high\n\n\nspeed by a vertical shaft The wet clothes are placed in the cage, and\nthe machine is started The water escapes through the perforations\nand runs down the side of the casing to a drain",

    "If cocks are fitted to the radiator pipes, the\namount of heat thus deflected can be governed Fig 192 Fig 192 192 —The \"tank\" system of hot-water supply\nA disadvantage of the tank system is that the tank, if placed high\nenough to supply all flows, is sometimes so far from the boiler that\nthe water loses much of its heat in the course of circulation Also, if\n\n\nfor any reason the cold water fails, tank A may be entirely emptied,\ncirculation cease, and the water in the boiler and pipes boil away\nrapidly THE CYLINDER SYSTEM\n(Fig 193) is open to neither of these objections 193) is open to neither of these objections Instead of a\nrectangular tank up aloft, we now have a large copper cylinder\nsituated in the kitchen near the range The flow and return pipes are\ncontinuous, and the cold supply enters the bottom of the cylinder\nthrough a pipe with a siphon bend in it As before, water is drawn off\nfrom the flow pipe, and a radiator may be put in the circuit Since\nthere is no draw-off point below the top of the cylinder, even if the\ncold supply fails the cylinder will remain full, and the failure will be\ndiscovered long before there is any danger of the water in it boiling\naway Since\nthere is no draw-off point below the top of the cylinder, even if the\ncold supply fails the cylinder will remain full, and the failure will be\ndiscovered long before there is any danger of the water in it boiling\naway Fig 193 Fig 193 —The \"cylinder\" system of hot-water supp\nBoiler explosions are due to obstructions in the pipes If the\nexpansion pipe and the cold-water supply pipe freeze, there is danger\nof a slight accumulation of steam; and if one of the circulation pipes is\nalso blocked, steam must generate until \"something has to go,\"[38]\nwhich is naturally the boiler Assuming that the pipes are quite full to\nthe points of obstruction, the fracture would result from the expansion\nof the water Steam cannot generate unless there be a space above the\nwater But the expanding water has stored up the heat which would\nhave raised steam, and the moment expansion begins after fracture\nthis energy is suddenly let loose Steam forms instantaneously,\naugmenting the effects of the explosion From this it will be gathered\nthat all pipes should be properly protected against frost; especially\nnear the roof Another cause of disaster is the furring up of the pipes with the lime\ndeposited by hard water when heated When hard water is used, the\n\n\npipes will sooner or later be blocked near the boiler; and as the\ndeposit is too hard to be scraped away, periodical renewals are\nunavoidable HOW A LAMP WORKS From heating we turn to lighting, and first to the ordinary paraffin\nlamp The two chief things to notice about this are the wick and the\nchimney The wick, being made of closely-woven cotton, draws up the\noil by what is known as capillary attraction If you dip the ends of two\nglass tubes, one half an inch, the other one-eighth of an inch in\ndiameter, into a vessel of water, you will notice that the water rises\nhigher in the smaller tube Or get two clean glass plates and lay them\nface to face, touching at one end, but kept slightly apart at the other\nby some small object If they are partly submerged perpendicularly,\nthe water will rise between the plates—furthest on the side at which\nthe two plates touch, and less and less as the other edge is\napproached The tendency of liquids to rise through porous bodies is a\nphenomenon for which we cannot account Mineral oil contains a large proportion of carbon and hydrogen; it\nis therefore termed hydro-carbon When oil reaches the top of a\nlighted wick, the liquid is heated until it turns into gas The carbon\nand hydrogen unite with the oxygen of the air Some particles of the\ncarbon apparently do not combine at once, and as they pass through\nthe fiery zone of the flame are heated to such a temperature as to\nbecome highly luminous It is to produce these light-rays that we use\na lamp, and to burn our oil efficiently we must supply the flame with\nplenty of oxygen, with more than it could naturally obtain So we\nsurround it with a transparent chimney of special glass The air inside\nthe chimney is heated, and rises; fresh air rushes in at the bottom, and\nis also heated and replaced As the air passes through, the flame seizes\non the oxygen If the wick is turned up until the flame becomes smoky\nand flares, the point has been passed at which the induced chimney\ndraught can supply sufficient oxygen to combine with the carbon of\nthe vapour, and the \"free\" carbon escapes as smoke The blower-plate used to draw up a fire (Fig 194) performs exactly\nthe same function as the lamp chimney, but on a larger scale The\nplate prevents air passing straight up the chimney over the coals, and\ncompels it to find a way through the fire itself to replace the heated\nair rising up the chimney",

    "200 The\nair-tight casing is divided by horizontal and vertical divisions into\nthree gas-chambers, B, C, and D Gas enters at A, and passes to the\nvalve chamber B The slide-valves of this allow it to pass into C and D,\nand also into the two circular leather bellows E, F, which are attached\nto the central division G, but are quite independent of one another The slide-valves of this allow it to pass into C and D,\nand also into the two circular leather bellows E, F, which are attached\nto the central division G, but are quite independent of one another Fig 200 Fig 200 —Sketch of the bellows and chambers\nof a \"dry\" gas meter We will suppose that in the illustration the valves are admitting gas\n\n\nto chamber C and bellows F The pressure in C presses the circular\nhead of E towards the division G, expelling the contents of the bellows\nthrough an outlet pipe (not shown) to the burners in operation within\nthe house Simultaneously the inflation of F forces the gas in chamber\nD also through the outlet The head-plates of the bellows are attached\nto rods and levers (not shown) working the slide-valves in B As soon\nas E is fully in, and F fully expanded, the valves begin to open and put\nthe inlet pipe in communication with D and E, and allow the contents\nof F and C to escape to the outlet The movements of the valve\nmechanism operate a train of counting wheels, visible through a glass\nwindow in the side of the case As the bellows have a definite\ncapacity, every stroke that they give means that a certain volume of\ngas has been ejected either from them or from the chambers in which\nthey move: this is registered by the counter The apparatus practically\nhas two double-action cylinders (of which the bellows ends are the\npistons) working on the same principle as the steam-cylinder (Fig 21)",

    "Dr Auer von Welsbach found that the substances most suitable for\nincandescent mantles were the oxides of certain rare metals, thorium,\nand cerium The mantle is made by dipping a cylinder of cotton net\ninto a solution of nitrate of thorium and cerium, containing 99 per\ncent of the former and 1 per cent of the latter metal When the fibres\nare sufficiently soaked, the mantle is withdrawn, squeezed, and placed\non a mould to dry It is next held over a Bunsen gas flame and the\ncotton is burned away, while the nitrates are converted into oxides The mantle is now ready for use, but very brittle So it has to undergo\na further dipping, in a solution of gun-cotton and alcohol, to render it\ntough enough for packing When it is required for use, it is suspended\nover the burner by an asbestos thread woven across the top, a light is\napplied to the bottom, and the collodion burned off, leaving nothing\nbut the heat-resisting oxides The burner used with a mantle is constructed on the Bunsen\nprinciple The gas is mixed, as it emerges from the jet, with sufficient\nair to render its combustion perfect All the carbon is burned, and the\nflame, though almost invisible, is intensely hot The mantle oxides\nconvert the heat energy of the flame into light energy This is proved\nnot only by the intense whiteness of the mantle, but by the fact that\nthe heat issuing from the chimney of the burner is not nearly so great\nwhen the mantle is in position as when it is absent The incandescent mantle is more extensively used every year In\nGermany 90 per cent of gas lighting is on the incandescent system,\nand in England about 40 per cent We may notice, as an interesting\nexample of the fluctuating fortunes of invention, that the once\ndoomed gas-burner has, thanks to Welsbach's mantle, in many\ninstances replaced the incandescent electric lamps that were to doom\nit [38] If, of course, there is no safety-valve in proper\nworking order included in the installation Chapter XX VARIOUS MECHANISMS Clocks and Watches:—A short history of timepieces—The\nconstruction \nof \ntimepieces—The \ndriving \npower—The\nescapement—Compensating pendulums—The spring balance\n—The \ncylinder \nescapement—The \nlever \nescapement—\nCompensated balance-wheels—Keyless winding mechanism\nfor watches—The hour hand train Locks:—The Chubb lock\n—The Yale lock The Cycle:—The gearing of a cycle—The\nfree \nwheel—The \nchange-speed \ngear Agricultural\nMachines:—The \nthreshing-machine—Mowing-machines Some Natural Phenomena:—Why sun-heat varies in\nintensity—The tides—Why high tide varies daily CLOCKS AND WATCHES A SHORT HISTORY OF TIMEPIECES The oldest device for measuring time is the sun-dial That of Ahaz\nmentioned in the Second Book of Kings is the earliest dial of which we\nhave record The obelisks of the Egyptians and the curious stone\npillars of the Druidic age also probably served as shadow-casters The clepsydra, or water-clock, also of great antiquity, was the first\ncontrivance for gauging the passage of the hours independently of the\nmotion of the earth In its simplest form it was a measure into which\nwater fell drop by drop, hour levels being marked on the inside Subsequently a very simple mechanism was added to drive a pointer\n—a float carrying a vertical rack, engaging with a cog on the pointer\nspindle; or a string from the float passed over a pulley attached to the\npointer and rotated it as the float rose, after the manner of the wheel\nbarometer (Fig 153) In 807 A D",

    "About 1500 Peter Hele of Nuremberg invented the mainspring as a\nsubstitute for the weight, and the watch appeared soon afterwards\n(1525 A D ) The pendulum was first adopted for controlling the\nmotion of the wheels by Christian Huygens, a distinguished Dutch\nmechanician, in 1659 To Thomas Tompion, \"the father of English watchmaking,\" is\nascribed the honour of first fitting a hairspring to the escapement of a\nwatch, in or about the year 1660 He also introduced the cylinder\nescapement now so commonly used in cheap watches Though many\nimprovements have been made since his time, Tompion manufactured\nclocks and watches which were excellent timekeepers, and as a\nreward for the benefits conferred on his fellows during his lifetime, he\nwas, after death, granted the exceptional honour of a resting-place in\nWestminster Abbey THE CONSTRUCTION OF TIMEPIECES A clock or watch contains three main elements:—(1) The source of\npower, which may be a weight or a spring; (2) the train of wheels\noperated by the driving force; (3) the agent for controlling the\nmovements of the train—this in large clocks is usually a pendulum, in\nsmall clocks and watches a hairspring balance To these may be\nadded, in the case of clocks, the apparatus for striking the hour THE DRIVING POWER THE DRIVING POWER Weights are used only in large clocks, such as one finds in halls,\ntowers, and observatories The great advantage of employing weights\nis that a constant driving power is exerted Springs occupy much less\nroom than weights, and are indispensable for portable timepieces The\nemployment of them caused trouble to early experimenters on\naccount of the decrease in power which necessarily accompanies the\nuncoiling of a wound-up spring Jacob Zech of Prague overcame the\ndifficulty in 1525 by the invention of the fusee, a kind of conical\npulley interposed between the barrel, or circular drum containing the\nmainspring, and the train of wheels which the spring has to drive The\nprinciple of the \"drum and fusee\" action will be understood from Fig",
    "The\nprinciple of the \"drum and fusee\" action will be understood from Fig 201 201 The mainspring is a long steel ribbon fixed at one end to an\narbor (the watchmaker's name for a spindle or axle), round which it is\ntightly wound The arbor and spring are inserted in the barrel The\narbor is prevented from turning by a ratchet, B, and click, and\ntherefore the spring in its effort to uncoil causes the barrel to rotate The\narbor is prevented from turning by a ratchet, B, and click, and\ntherefore the spring in its effort to uncoil causes the barrel to rotate Fig 201 Fig 201 201 A string of catgut (or a very fine chain) is connected at one end to\nthe circumference of the drum, and wound round it, the other end\nbeing fixed to the larger end of the fusee, which is attached to the\ndriving-wheel of the watch or clock by the intervention of a ratchet\nand click (not shown) To wind the spring the fusee is turned\nbackward by means of a key applied to the square end A of the fusee\narbor, and this draws the string from off the drum on to the fusee The\nforce of the spring causes the fusee to rotate by pulling the string off\n\n\nit, coil by coil, and so drives the train of wheels But while the\nmainspring, when fully wound, turns the fusee by uncoiling the string\nfrom the smallest part of the fusee, it gets the advantage of the larger\nradius as its energy becomes lessened The fusee is still used for marine chronometers, for some clocks\nthat have a mainspring and pendulum, and occasionally for watches In the latter it has been rendered unnecessary by the introduction of\nthe going-barrel by Swiss watchmakers, who formed teeth on the edge\nof the mainspring barrel to drive the train of wheels This kind of\ndrum is called \"going\" because it drives the watch during the\noperation of winding, which is performed by rotating the drum arbor\nto which the inner end of the spring is attached A ratchet prevents\nthe arbor from being turned backwards by the spring The adoption of\nthe going-barrel has been made satisfactory by the improvements in\nthe various escapement actions THE ESCAPEMENT Fig 202 Fig 202",
    "202 The spring or weight transmits its power through a train of cogs to\nthe escapement, or device for regulating the rate at which the wheels\nare to revolve In clocks a pendulum is generally used as the\ncontrolling agent Galileo, when a student at Pisa, noticed that certain\nhanging lamps in the cathedral there swung on their cords at an equal\nrate; and on investigation he discovered the principle that the shorter\na pendulum is the more quickly will it swing to and fro As has\nalready been observed, Huygens first applied the principle to the\ngoverning of clocks In Fig 202 we have a simple representation of\nthe \"dead-beat\" escapement commonly used in clocks The escape-\nwheel is mounted on the shaft of the last cog of the driving train, the\npallet on a spindle from which depends a split arm embracing the rod\nand the pendulum We must be careful to note that the pendulum\ncontrols motion only; it does not cause movement The escape-wheel revolves in a clockwise direction The two pallets\na and b are so designed that only one can rest on the teeth at one\n\n\ntime In the sketch the sloping end of b has just been forced upwards\nby the pressure of a tooth This swings the pallet and the pendulum The momentum of the latter causes a to descend, and at the instant\nwhen b clears its tooth a catches and holds another The left-hand side\nof a, called the locking-face, is part of a circle, so that the escape-wheel\nis held motionless as long as it touches a: hence the term, \"dead\nbeat\"—that is, brought to a dead stop As the pendulum swings back,\nto the left, under the influence of gravity, a is raised and frees the\ntooth The wheel jerks round, and another tooth is caught by the\nlocking-face of b Again the pendulum swings to the right, and the\nsloping end of b is pushed up once more, giving the pendulum fresh\nimpetus This process repeats itself as long as the driving power lasts\n—for weeks, months, or years, as the case may be, and the mechanism\ncontinues to be in good working order COMPENSATING PENDULUMS Metal expands when heated; therefore a steel pendulum which is of\nthe exact length to govern a clock correctly at a temperature of 60°\nwould become too long at 80°, and slow the clock, and too short at\n40°, and cause it to gain In common clocks the pendulum rod is often\nmade of wood, which maintains an almost constant length at all\nordinary temperatures But for very accurate clocks something more\nefficient is required Graham, the partner of Thomas Tompion, took\nadvantage of the fact that different kinds of metal have different ratios\nof expansion to produce a self-compensating pendulum on the principle\nillustrated by Fig",
    "Graham, the partner of Thomas Tompion, took\nadvantage of the fact that different kinds of metal have different ratios\nof expansion to produce a self-compensating pendulum on the principle\nillustrated by Fig 203 203 He used steel for the rod, and formed the bob,\nor weighted end, of a glass jar containing mercury held in a stirrup;\nthe mercury being of such a height that, as the pendulum rod\nlengthened with a rise of temperature, the mercury expanded upwards\nsufficiently to keep the distance between the point of suspension and\nthe centre of gravity of the bob always the same With a fall of\ntemperature the rod shortened, while the mercury sank in the jar This\ndevice has not been improved upon, and is still used in observatories\nand other places where timekeepers of extreme precision are required The milled nut S in Fig 203 is fitted at the end of the pendulum rod\n\n\nto permit the exact adjustment of the pendulum's length For watches, chronometers, and small clocks\nTHE SPRING BALANCE\ntakes the place of the pendulum We still have an escape-wheel with\nteeth of a suitable shape to give impulses to the controlling agent There are two forms of spring escapement, but as both employ a\nhairspring and balance-wheel we will glance at these before going\nfurther Fig 203 Fig 203 203 The hairspring is made of very fine steel ribbon, tempered to\nextreme elasticity, and shaped to a spiral The inner end is attached to\nthe arbor of the balance-wheel, the outer end to a stud projecting from\nthe plate of the watch When the balance-wheel, impelled by the\nescapement, rotates, it winds up the spring The energy thus stored\nhelps the wheel to revolve the other way during the locking of a tooth\nof the escape-wheel The time occupied by the winding and the\nunwinding depends upon the length of the spring The strength of the\nimpulse makes no difference A strong impulse causes the spring to\ncoil itself up more than a weak impulse would; but inasmuch as more\nenergy is stored the process of unwinding is hastened To put the\nmatter very simply—a strong impulse moves the balance-wheel\nfurther, but rotates it quickly; a weak impulse moves it a shorter\ndistance, but rotates it slowly In fact, the principle of the pendulum is\nalso that of the hairspring; and the duration of a vibration depends on\nthe length of the rod in the one case, and of the spring in the other Motion is transmitted to the balance by one of two methods Either\n(1) directly, by a cylinder escapement; or (2) indirectly, through a\nlever",
    "Either\n(1) directly, by a cylinder escapement; or (2) indirectly, through a\nlever Fig 204 Fig 204 —\"Cylinder\" watch\nescapement THE CYLINDER ESCAPEMENT\n\n\nis seen in Fig 204 204 The escape-wheel has sharp teeth set on stalks (One tooth is removed to show the stalk ) The balance-wheel is\nmounted on a small steel cylinder, with part of the circumference cut\naway at the level of the teeth, so that if seen from above it would\nappear like a in our illustration A tooth is just beginning to shove its\npoint under the nearer edge of the opening As it is forced forwards, b\nis revolved in a clockwise direction, winding up the hairspring When\nthe tooth has passed the nearer edge it flies forward, striking the\ninside of the further wall of the cylinder, which holds it while the\nspring uncoils The tooth now pushes its way past the other edge,\naccelerating the unwinding, and, as it escapes, the next tooth jumps\nforward and is arrested by the outside of the cylinder The balance\nnow reverses its motion, is helped by the tooth, is wound up, locks the\ntooth, and so on THE LEVER ESCAPEMENT\nis somewhat more complicated The escape-wheel teeth are locked\nand unlocked by the pallets P P1 projecting from a lever which moves\non a pivot (Fig 205) The end of the lever is forked, and has a square\nnotch in it On the arbor of the balance-wheel is a roller, or plate, R,\nwhich carries a small pin, I Two pins, B B, projecting from the plate\nof the watch prevent the lever moving too far We must further notice\nthe little pin C on the lever, and a notch in the edge of the roller",
    "We must further notice\nthe little pin C on the lever, and a notch in the edge of the roller Fig 205 Fig 205 —\"Lever\" watch escapement In the illustration a tooth has just passed under the \"impulse face\" b\nof P1 The lever has been moved upwards at the right end; and its\nforked end has given an impulse to R, and through it to the balance-\nwheel The spring winds up The pin C prevents the lever dropping,\nbecause it no longer has the notch opposite to it, but presses on the\ncircumference of R As the spring unwinds it strikes the lever at the\nmoment when the notch and C are opposite The lever is knocked\ndownwards, and the tooth, which had been arrested by the locking-\nface a of pallet P, now presses on the impulse face b, forcing the left\nend of the lever up The impulse pin I receives a blow, assisting the\nunwinding of the spring, and C again locks the lever The same thing\nis repeated in alternate directions over and over again The same thing\nis repeated in alternate directions over and over again COMPENSATING BALANCE-WHEELS The watchmaker has had to overcome the same difficulty as the\nclockmaker with regard to the expansion of the metal in the\ncontrolling agent When a metal wheel is heated its spokes lengthen,\nand the rim recedes from the centre Now, let us suppose that we have\ntwo rods of equal weight, one three feet long, the other six feet long To an end of each we fasten a 2-lb weight We shall find it much\neasier to wave the shorter rod backwards and forwards quickly than\nthe other Why Because the weight of the longer rod has more\nleverage over the hand than has that of the shorter rod Similarly, if,\nwhile the mass of the rim of a wheel remains constant, the length of\nthe spokes varies, the effort needed to rotate the wheel to and fro at a\nconstant rate must vary also Graham got over the difficulty with a\nrod by means of the compensating pendulum Thomas Earnshaw\nmastered it in wheels by means of the compensating balance, using the\nsame principle—namely, the unequal expansion of different metals Any one who owns a compensated watch will see, on stopping the\ntiny fly-wheel, that it has two spokes (Fig 206), each carrying an\nalmost complete semicircle of rim attached to it A close examination\nshows that the rim is compounded of an outer strip of brass welded to\nan inner lining of steel The brass element expands more with heat\n\n\nand contracts more with cold than steel; so that when the spokes\nbecome elongated by a rise of temperature, the pieces bend inwards at\ntheir free ends (Fig 207); if the temperature falls, the spokes are\nshortened, and the rim pieces bend outwards (Fig 208) [39] This\ningenious contrivance keeps the leverage of the rim constant within\nvery fine limits The screws S S are inserted in the rim to balance it\ncorrectly, and very fine adjustment is made by means of the four tiny\nweights W W In ships' chronometers,[40] the rim pieces are sub-\ncompensated towards their free ends to counteract slight errors in the\nprimary compensation So delicate is the compensation that a daily\nloss or gain of only half a second is often the limit of error Fig 206 Fig 206 Fig 2\nFig 2\nA \"compensating\" watch balance, at normal,\nsuper-normal, and sub-normal temperatures KEYLESS WINDING MECHANISM FOR WATCHES The inconvenience attaching to a key-wound watch caused the\nSwiss manufacturers to put on the market, in 1851, watches which\ndispensed with a separate key Those of our readers who carry keyless\nwatches will be interested to learn how the winding and setting of the\nhands is effected by the little serrated knob enclosed inside the\npendant ring There are two forms of \"going-barrel\" keyless mechanism—(1) The\nrocking bar; (2) the shifting sleeve The rocking bar device is shown in\nFigs 209, 210",

    "212 The simplest form of lock, such as is found in desks and very cheap\narticles, works on the principle shown in Fig The simplest form of lock, such as is found in desks and very cheap\narticles, works on the principle shown in Fig 212 The bolt is split at\nthe rear, and the upper part bent upwards to form a spring The under\nedge has two notches cut in it, separated by a curved excrescence The\nkey merely presses the bolt upwards against the spring, until the\nnotch, engaging with the frame, moves it backwards or forwards until\nthe spring drives the tail down into the other notch This primitive\ndevice affords, of course, very little security An advance is seen in the\nTUMBLER LOCK Fig 213 Fig 213 213 The bolt now can move only in a horizontal direction It has an\nopening cut in it with two notches (Figs It has an\nopening cut in it with two notches (Figs 213, 214) 213, 214) Behind the bolt\n\n\nlies the tumbler T (indicated by the dotted line), pivoted at the angle\non a pin From the face of the tumbler a stud, S, projects through the\nhole in the bolt This stud is forced into one or other of the notches by\nthe spring, S1, which presses on the tail of the tumbler This stud is forced into one or other of the notches by\nthe spring, S1, which presses on the tail of the tumbler Fig 214 Fig 214 In Fig 213 the key is about to actuate the locking mechanism The\nnext diagram (Fig 214) shows how the key, as it enters the notch on\nthe lower side of the bolt to move it along, also raises the tumbler\nstud clear of the projection between the two notches By the time that\nthe bolt has been fully \"shot,\" the key leaves the under notch and\nallows the tumbler stud to fall into the rear locking-notch A lock of this type also can be picked very easily, as the picker has\nmerely to lift the tumbler and move the bolt along Barron's lock,\npatented in 1778, had two tumblers and two studs; and the opening in\nthe bolt had notches at the top as well as at the bottom (Fig",
    "Barron's lock,\npatented in 1778, had two tumblers and two studs; and the opening in\nthe bolt had notches at the top as well as at the bottom (Fig 215) 215) This made it necessary for both tumblers to be raised simultaneously\nto exactly the right height If either was not lifted sufficiently, a stud\ncould not clear its bottom notch; if either rose too far, it engaged an\nupper notch The chances therefore were greatly against a wrong key\nturning the lock The chances therefore were greatly against a wrong key\nturning the lock Fig 215 Fig 215 —The bolt of a Barron lock THE CHUBB LOCK\nis an amplification of this principle It usually has several tumblers of\nthe shape shown in Fig 216 The lock stud in these locks projects\nfrom the bolt itself, and the openings, or \"gates,\" through which the\nstud must pass as the lock moves, are cut in the tumblers It will be\nnoticed that the forward notch of the tumbler has square serrations in\nthe edges These engage with similar serrations in the bolt stud and\nmake it impossible to raise the tumbler if the bolt begins to move too\nsoon when a wrong key is inserted These engage with similar serrations in the bolt stud and\nmake it impossible to raise the tumbler if the bolt begins to move too\nsoon when a wrong key is inserted Fig 216 Fig 216 —Tumbler of Chubb lock Fig 217 is a Chubb key with eight steps That nearest the head (8)\noperates a circular revolving curtain, which prevents the introduction\nof picking tools when a key is inserted and partly turned, as the key\nslot in the curtain is no longer opposite that in the lock Step 1 moves\nthe bolt Fig 217 Fig 217 —A Chubb key In order to shoot the bolt the height of the key steps must be so\nproportioned to the depth of their tumblers that all the gates in the\ntumblers are simultaneously raised to the right level for the stud to\npass through them, as in Fig",

    "222 When the rider ceases to pedal, the chain-ring becomes stationary,\nbut the ratchet continues to revolve The pawls offer no resistance to\nthe ratchet teeth, which push them up into the semicircular recesses\nin the chain-ring Each one rises as it passes over a tooth It is obvious\nthat driving power cannot be transmitted again to the road wheel\nuntil the chain-wheel is turned fast enough to overtake the ratchet THE CHANGE-SPEED GEAR A gain in speed means a loss in power, and vice versâ By gearing-\nup a cycle we are able to make the driving-wheel revolve faster than\nthe pedals, but at the expense of control over the driving-wheel A\nhigh-geared cycle is fast on the level, but a bad hill-climber The low-\ngeared machine shows to disadvantage on the flat, but is a good hill-\n\n\nclimber Similarly, the express engine must have large driving-wheels,\nthe goods engine small driving-wheels, to perform their special\nfunctions properly In order to travel fast over level country, and yet be able to mount\nhills without undue exertion, we must be able to do what the motorist\ndoes—change gear Two-speed and three-speed gears are now very\ncommonly fitted to cycles They all work on the same principle, that\nof the epicyclic train of cog-wheels, the mechanisms being so devised\nthat the hub turns more slowly than, at the same speed as, or faster\nthan the small chain-wheel,[42] according to the wish of the rider We do not propose to do more here than explain the principle of\nthe epicyclic train, which means \"a wheel on (or running round) a\nwheel \" Lay a footrule on the table and roll a cylinder along it by the\naid of a second rule, parallel to the first, but resting on the cylinder It\nwill be found that, while the cylinder advances six inches, the upper\nrule advances twice that distance In the absence of friction the work\ndone by the agent moving the upper rule is equal to that done in\novercoming the force which opposes the forward motion of the\ncylinder; and as the distance through which the cylinder advances is\nonly half that through which the upper rule advances, it follows that\nthe force which must act on the upper rule is only half as great as that\novercome in moving the cylinder The carter makes use of this\nprinciple when he puts his hand to the top of a wheel to help his cart\nover an obstacle Fig 223 Fig 223 Fig 224 Fig 224 Fig 225 Fig 225",
    "225 Now see how this principle is applied to the change-speed gear The lower rule is replaced by a cog-wheel, C (Fig 223); the cylinder\nby a cog, B, running round it; and the upper rule by a ring, A, with\ninternal teeth We may suppose that A is the chain-ring, B a cog\nmounted on a pin projecting from the hub, and C a cog attached to\nthe fixed axle It is evident that B will not move so fast round C as A\ndoes The amount by which A will get ahead of B can be calculated\n\n\neasily We begin with the wheels in the position shown in Fig 223 A\npoint, I, on A is exactly over the topmost point of C For the sake of\nconvenience we will first assume that instead of B running round C, B\nis revolved on its axis for one complete revolution in a clockwise\ndirection, and that A and C move as in Fig For the sake of\nconvenience we will first assume that instead of B running round C, B\nis revolved on its axis for one complete revolution in a clockwise\ndirection, and that A and C move as in Fig 224 If B has 10 teeth, C\n30, and A 40, A will have been moved 10⁄40 = ¼ of a revolution in a\nclockwise direction, and C 10⁄30 = ⅓ of a revolution in an anti-\nclockwise direction Now, coming back to what actually does happen, we shall be able\nto understand how far A rotates round C relatively to the motion of B,\nwhen C is fixed and B rolls (Fig 225) B advances ⅓ of distance round\nC; A advances ⅓ + ¼ = 7⁄12 of distance round B The fractions, if\nreduced to a common denominator, are as 4:7, and this is equivalent\nto 40 (number of teeth on A): 40 + 30 (teeth on A + teeth on C )\nTo leave the reader with a very clear idea we will summarize the\nmatter thus:—If T = number of teeth on A, t = number of teeth on C,\nthen movement of A: movement of B:: T + t: T Here is a two-speed hub Let us count the teeth The chain-ring (=\nA) has 64 internal teeth, and the central cog (= C) on the axle has 16\nteeth There are four cogs (= B) equally spaced, running on pins\nprojecting from the hub-shell between A and C How much faster than\nB does A run round C Apply the formula:—Motion of A: motion of B::\n64 + 16: 64 That is, while A revolves once, B and the hub and the\ndriving-wheel will revolve only 64⁄80 = ⅘ of a turn To use scientific\nlanguage, B revolves 20 per cent slower than A This is the gearing we use for hill-climbing On the level we want\nthe driving-wheel to turn as fast as, or faster than, the chain-ring To\nmake it turn at the same rate, both A and C must revolve together In\none well-known gear this is effected by sliding C along the spindle of\nthe wheel till it disengages itself from the spindle, and one end locks\nwith the plate which carries A Since B is now being pulled round at\nthe bottom as well as the top, it cannot rotate on its own axis any\nlonger, and the whole train revolves solidly—that is, while A turns\n\n\nthrough a circle B does the same To get an increase of gearing, matters must be so arranged that the\ndrive is transmitted from the chain-wheel to B, and from A to the hub While B describes a circle, A and the driving-wheel turn through a\ncircle and a part of a circle—that is, the driving-wheel revolves faster\nthan the hub Given the same number of teeth as before, the\nproportional rates will be A = 80, B = 64, so that the gear rises 25\nper cent By means of proper mechanism the power is transmitted in a three-\nspeed gear either (1) from chain-wheel to A, A to B, B to wheel = low\ngear; or (2) from chain-wheel to A and C simultaneously = solid,\nnormal, or middle gear; or (3) from chain-wheel to B, B to A, A to\nwheel = high gear In two-speed gears either 1 or 3 is omitted AGRICULTURAL MACHINES THE THRESHING-MACHINE",
    "THE THRESHING-MACHINE Bread would not be so cheap as it is were the flail still the only\nmeans of separating the grain from the straw What the cream\nseparator has done for the dairy industry (p 384), the threshing-\nmachine has done for agriculture A page or two ought therefore to be\nspared for this useful invention Fig 226 Fig 226 —Section of a threshing m\nIn Fig 226 a very complete fore-and-aft section of the machine is\ngiven After the bands of the sheaves have been cut, the latter are fed\ninto the mouth of the drum A by the feeder, who stands in the feeding-\nbox on the top of the machine The drum revolves at a very high\n\n\nvelocity, and is fitted with fluted beaters which act against a steel\nconcave, or breastwork, B, the grain being threshed out of the straw\nin passing between the two The breastwork is provided with open\nwires, through which most of the threshed grain, cavings (short\nstraws), and chaff passes on to a sloping board The straw is flung\nforward on to the shakers C, which gradually move the straw towards\nthe open end and throw it off Any grain, etc , that has escaped the\ndrum falls through the shakers on to D, and works backwards to the\ncaving riddles, or moving sieves, E The main blower, by means of a\nrevolving fan, N, sends air along the channel X upwards through these\nriddles, blowing the short straws away to the left The grain, husks,\nand dust fall through E on to G, over the end of which they fall on to\nthe chaff riddle, H A second column of air from the blower drives the\nchaff away The heavy grain, seeds, dust, etc , fall on to I, J, and K in\nturn, and are shaken until only the grain remains to pass along L to\nthe elevator bottom, M An endless band with cups attached to it\nscoops up the grain, carries it aloft, and shoots it into hopper P It\nthen goes through the shakers Q, R, is dusted by the back end blower,\nS, and slides down T into the open end of the rotary screen-drum U,\nwhich is mounted on the slope, so that as it turns the grain travels\ngradually along it The first half of the screen has wires set closely\ntogether All the small grain that falls through this, called \"thirds,\"\npasses into a hopper, and is collected in a sack attached to the hopper\nmouth The \"seconds\" fall through the second half of the drum, more\nwidely spaced, into their sack; and the \"firsts\" fall out of the end and\nthrough a third spout MOWING-MACHINES Fig 227 Fig 227",
    "227 The ordinary lawn—mower employs a revolving reel, built up of\nspirally-arranged knives, the edges of which pass very close to a sharp\nplate projecting from the frame of the mower Each blade, as it turns,\nworks along the plate, giving a shearing cut to any grass that may be\n\n\ncaught between the two cutting edges The action is that of a pair of\nscissors (Fig 227), one blade representing the fixed, the other the\nmoving knife If you place a cylinder of wood in the scissors it will be\ndriven forward by the closing of the blades, and be marked by them\nas it passes along the edges The same thing happens with grass,\nwhich is so soft that it is cut right through HAY-CUTTER The hay-cutter is another adaptation of the same principle A cutter-\nbar is pulled rapidly backwards and forwards in a frame which runs a\nfew inches above the ground by a crank driven by the wheels through\ngearing To the front edge of the bar are attached by one side a\nnumber of triangular knives The frame carries an equal number of\nspikes pointing forward horizontally Through slots in these the\ncutter-bar works, and its knives give a drawing cut to grass caught\nbetween them and the sides of the spikes SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA WHY SUN-HEAT VARIES IN INTENSITY The more squarely parallel heat-rays strike a surface the greater will\nbe the number that can affect that surface This is evident from Figs 228, 229, where A B is an equal distance in both cases The nearer the\nsun is to the horizon, the more obliquely do its rays strike the earth Hence midday is necessarily warmer than the evening, and the\ntropics, where the sun stands overhead, are hotter than the temperate\nzones, where, even in summer at midday, the rays fall more or less on\nthe slant Fig 228 Fig 228 Fig 229 Fig 229 The atmospheric envelope which encompasses the earth tends to\nincrease the effect of obliquity, since a slanting ray has to travel\n\n\nfurther through it and is robbed of more heat than a vertical ray THE TIDES All bodies have an attraction for one another The earth attracts the\nmoon, and the moon attracts the earth Now, though the effect of this\nattraction is not visible as regards the solid part of the globe, it is\nstrongly manifested by the water which covers a large portion of the\nearth's surface The moon attracts the water most powerfully at two\npoints, that nearest to it and that furthest away from it; as shown on\nan exaggerated scale in Fig",
    "The moon attracts the water most powerfully at two\npoints, that nearest to it and that furthest away from it; as shown on\nan exaggerated scale in Fig 230 230 Since the earth and the water\nrevolve as one mass daily on their axis, every point on the\ncircumference would be daily nearest to and furthest from the moon\nat regular intervals, and wherever there is ocean there would be two\ntides in that period, were the moon stationary as regards the earth (It\nshould be clearly understood that the tides are not great currents, but\nmere thickenings of the watery envelope The inrush of the tide is due\nto the temporary rise of level )\nFig 230 Fig 230 Fig 231 Fig 231 WHY HIGH TIDE VARIES DAILY The moon travels round the earth once in twenty-eight days In Fig 231 the point a is nearest the moon at, say, twelve noon At the end of\ntwenty-four hours it will have arrived at the same position by the\ncompass, but yet not be nearest to the moon, which has in that period\nmoved on 1⁄28th of a revolution round the earth [43] Consequently\nhigh tide will not occur till a has reached position b and overtaken the\nmoon, as it were, which takes about an hour on the average This\nexplains why high tide occurs at intervals of more than twelve hours Fig 232 Fig 232 232 —Relative positions of sun, moon, and earth at \"spring\"\ntides Fig 233 Fig 233 —Relative positions of sun,\ntides NEAP TIDES AND SPRING TIDES The sun, as well as the moon, attracts the ocean, but with less\npower, owing to its being so much further away At certain periods of\nthe month, sun, earth, and moon are all in line Sun and moon then\npull together, and we get the highest, or spring tides (Fig 232) When\nsun and moon pull at right angles to one another—namely, at the first\nand third quarters—the excrescence caused by the moon is flattened\n(Fig 233), and we get the lowest, or neap tides [39] In both Figs 207 and 208 the degree of expansion is\nvery greatly exaggerated [40] As the sun passes the meridian (twelve o'clock, noon)\nthe chronometer's reading is taken, and the longitude, or\ndistance east or west of Greenwich, is reckoned by the\ndifference in time between local noon and that of the\nchronometer [41] For much of the information given here about clocks\nand watches the author is indebted to \"The History of\nWatches,\" by Mr J F Kendal",
