    "2008), (Peng and Pai 2014) However, low frequency range applications of such locally resonant meta-materials require very heavy\ninternal moving masses with potentially large response amplitudes of oscillation, which may prohibit\ntheir practical implementation For example, the relevant applications reported in seismic meta-materials and seismic meta-structures\n(Cheng and Shi 2014), (Shi et al 2014), (Huang and Shi 2013), (Colombi et al 2016), (Palermo et al 2016) refer to frequencies higher than 2 5Hz with limited band gaps, well above the main frequency\nrange [0 5Hz-3 0Hz] of seismic excitations Although preliminary results have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of the design of acoustic/elastic meta-material based seismic meta-structures (Dertimanis et\nal Although preliminary results have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of the design of acoustic/elastic meta-material based seismic meta-structures (Dertimanis et\nal 2016), (Wagner et al 2016) with frequency ranges between [0 5Hz-1 5Hz] well within the seismic\nfrequency range, they still require very heavy internal oscillating masses Similarly, current applications of locally resonant meta-materials in acoustics (Groby et al Similarly, current applications of locally resonant meta-materials in acoustics (Groby et al 2014),\n(Weisser et al 2016) address frequencies well above 500Hz No effective applications in low\nfrequency noise isolation with frequencies well below 500Hz have been reported It should be\nmentioned, that in this frequency range, the performance of the already existing noise insulation\nmaterials is quite poor In order to resolve this disadvantage, the paper considers the application of negative stiffness based\ndamping concepts towards the design of highly dissipative low-frequency elastic/acoustic meta## materials Such an oscillator design concept is proposed in (Antoniadis et al , 2015), in co r p o r a t in g a n eg a t iv e s t iff n e ss ele m e n t, which can exhibit e x t r a o r d in a r y da m p in g p r o p e r t ie s, w it h o u t p r e s e n t in g the d r a w ba c k s of the t r ad it io na l linear o s c illa t o r, or of the ’z e r o- s t iff n e ss ’ designs Although the proposed o s c illa t o r in co r p o r a t e s a n eg a t iv e s t iff n e ss ele m e n t, it is designed to be both s t a t ic a lly and dynamically s t ab le Once such a s y s t e m is designed according to the approach p r o p o s e d in (Antoniadis et al , 2015), it is shown to exhibit an e x t r a o r d in a r y damping behaviour The above idea of (Antoniadis et al , 2015) is further treated in a systematic way in (Antoniadis et al 2016), within the context of the design of a general class of tuned mass dampers The resulting\nKDamper concept is a novel passive vibration isolation and damping concept, based essentially on the\noptimal combination of appropriate stiffness elements, which include a negative stiffness element The\nKDamper can be considered as an extension of the traditional Tuned Mass Damper (TMD), by the\naddition of a negative stiffness element to the internal oscillating mass Contrary to the TMD and its\nvariants, the KDamper substitutes the inertial forces of the added TMD mass by the stiffness force of\nthe negative stiffness element Among others, this can provide significant comparative advantages,\nespecially in the very low frequency range As a result, the KDamper can achieve better damping\ncharacteristics, without the need of additional heavy masses, as in the case of the TMD Moreover,\nsince the isolation and damping properties of the KDamper essentially result from the stiffness\nelements of the system, further technological advantages can emerge, in terms of weight, complexity\nand reliability A preliminary review of the reported physical principles for the design of negative stiffness elements\n## can be found in (Antoniadis et al",
