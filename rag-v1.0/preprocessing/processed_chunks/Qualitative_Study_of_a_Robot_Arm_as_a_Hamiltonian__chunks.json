the special case\n\n\n|β 2 | = mgL and |β 1 | = 2mgL (43)\n\n\nit can be shown that all fixed points are degenerate, i e",
    "e , the jacobian matrices of the\n\n\nlinearized system in the neighborhood of those fixed points have all vanishing eigenvalues In this case, a new procedure must be taken, so that at first this degenerescence is raised,\n\n\nand then the points are classified[9] We will not approach the degenerate case here From what has been seen above, the topology of orbits in the linear neighborhood of\n\n\nfixed points is the same for both the null-torques and non-null constant torques cases By the introduction of constant external torques, their intensity can be adjusted so that\n\n\nthe robot arm be held any desired configuration in equilibrium The majority of those\n\n\nequilibrium points are unstable, though: any fluctuation on the initial conditions can take\n\n\nthe system out of equilibrium In the case of the saddle-center points, the choice of certain\n\n\nbranches of the saddle can lead to stable equilibrium, even in the presence of fluctuations In the case of the saddle-center points, the choice of certain\n\n\nbranches of the saddle can lead to stable equilibrium, even in the presence of fluctuations 13\n\n\nV 13\n\n\nV CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS\n\n\nWe have proposed that the planar manipulator with two links and two rotational joins, a\n\n\nsystem with two degrees of freedom, be described by the hamiltonian of a double pendulum\n\n\nsubject to two external torques In its phase space, four fixed points (stationary solutions)\n\n\ncan be found; a pure center, a pure saddle, and two saddle-centers, which can be used as a\n\n\nclue to the structure of orbits in in all phase space We have also observed that there are two\n\n\nsimilar invariant manifolds, each one of them associated to a saddle-center points The phase\n\n\nportrait of the system upon those manifolds resembles that of a mathematical pendulum\n\n\nof arbitrary amplitude Dynamics upon such manifolds is governed by a unidimensional\n\n\nautonomous system, thus being totally integrable For any set of initial conditions placed\n\n\non one such manifold, the orbits will be confined to that manifold We should keep in mind,\n\n\nhowever, that those manifolds are embedded into a four-dimensional phase space, so that\n\n\nthe system in general in non-integrable An important result is that for constant external torques, the phase space topology in\n\n\nthe linear neighborhood of the fixed points is the same as that of the null-torques case, if\n\n\ncertain conditions involving the torques and parameters of the system are satisfied With a\n\n\nproper choice of torque intensities, then, we may define any point in configuration space as\n\n\na fixed point, without altering its nature, in relation to the null-torques case In particular,\n\n\nthe topology of orbits in the linear neighborhood of the saddle-center points is the same, as\n\n\nthe existence of the corresponding invariant manifolds A possible continuation of this work involves the analysis of the non-linear neighbor\n\nhood of fixed points Strong indications of chaotic behavior are expected, due to the non\n\nintegrability of the system Strong indications of chaotic behavior are expected, due to the non\n\nintegrability of the system Acknowledgment\n\n\nG A Monerat & E V Corrˆea Silva thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\n\n\nCient´ıfico e Tecnol´ogico (CNPq), Brazil, for finantial support [1] A A Shabana Dynamics of Multibody Systems U S A A , John Willey & Sons, 1998 , John Willey & Sons, 1998 14\n\n\n[2] P Hagedorn Hagedorn Oscila¸c˜oes N˜ao-Lineares S˜ao Paulo, Ed Edgar Bl¨ucher, 1984 Edgar Bl¨ucher, 1984 [3] L Meirovitch Meirovitch Analytical Methods in Vibrations Canada, The Macmillan Company, 1967 [4] L Landau, E Lifschitz Mecˆanica Moscow, Mir, 1980 [5] G A Monerat, H P de Oliveira, I D Soares Phys Rev D58(1998)063504 [6] M A Moser Commum Pure and Appl Math 11(1958)257 [7] A M Ozorio de Almeida Sistemas Hamiltonianos, Caos e Quantiza¸c˜ao 3 [rd] ed S˜ao Paulo,\n\n\nUnicamp, 1995 [8] H P de Oliveira, S D Soares, T J Stuchi Phys Rev D56(1997)730 [9] O I Bogoyavlensky Methods in the Qualitative Theory of Dynamical Systems in Astrophysics\n\n\nand Gas Dynamics Springer-Verlarg, 1985 15"
