    "**Dispersion-induced generation of higher order transversal modes in singly-**\n\n**resonant optical parametric oscillators**\n\n\nKai Drühl\n\nCenter for Technology Research\n\nMaharishi University of Management\n\nFairfield IA 52557-1074\n\ne-mail: kdruhl@mum edu\n\n\nWe study the effects of higher order transversal modes in a model of a singly\nresonant OPO, using both numerical solutions and mode expansions including up\n\nto two radial modes The numerical and two-mode solutions predict lower\n\nthreshold and higher conversion than the single-mode solution at negative\n\ndispersion Relative power in the zero order radial mode ranges from about 88% at\n\npositive and small negative dispersion to 48% at larger negative dispersion, with\n\nmost of the higher mode content in the first mode, and less than 2% in higher\n\nmodes PACS Numbers: 42 65 Ky, 42 10 10 Qj\n\nKey Words: parametric oscillation, phase-matching, diffraction\n\n\nContinuous-wave operation

Words: parametric oscillation, phase-matching, diffraction\n\n\nContinuous-wave operation of singly-resonant optical parametric oscillators (SRO)\n\nhas recently been demonstrated for various non-linear materials, including KTP [1\n3] and periodically-poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) [4-6] Significant pump depletion was\n\n\nachieved, up to 93% in [6] In these experiments, with zero beam walk-off and\n\nconfocal parameters of pump and signal comparable to the crystal length,\n\ndiffractive effects are known to be important [7,8] Theoretical studies including\n\ndiffractive effects for cw SROs [7,8] have been published for the case of small\n\npump depletion, and give the dependence of the threshold on the focusing\n\ngeometry A treatment of a low-loss SRO for arbitrary pump depletion in the\n\nplane-wave approximation was given in [9] A numerical model including\n\ndiffraction and pump depletion for a nano-second pulsed SRO with significant\n\nbirefrigent walk-off was presented in [10] To the best of our knowledge, no study\n\nof diffractive effects for arbitrary pump depletion in a cw SRO without beam walk\noff has been published so far In particular, it is not known how the transverse\n\nmode content of the idler beam and the amount of pump depletion depend upon\n\npump power and dispersion In this letter, we present such results for an SRO with\n\nlow cavity losses [2] We find that the idler beam contains higher transverse modes\n\nwith appreciable amplitudes, and that these amplitudes depend only weakly on the\n\namount of pump depletion, but strongly on the amount of dispersion We use the coupled wave equations for signal, idler and pump fields AF\n\n\n(F=S,I,P) in the form:\n\n\nAS,z = (j/2kS)(AS,xx + AS,yy) + j κ S exp(j ∆ z)APAI* (1 a)\n\n\nAI,z = (j/2kI)(AI,xx + AI,yy) + j κ I exp(j ∆ z)APAS*, (1 b)\n\n\nAP,z = (j/2kP)(AP,xx + AP,yy) + j κ P exp(-j ∆ z)ASAI (1 c)\n\n\nwhere κ F= ω F d/(nF c) and d is the effective nonlinear constant The subscripts\n\n\nx,y and z denote partial derivatives with respect to these spatial coordinates and,\n\n\nfor a periodically-poled crystal, ∆ =kP-kS-kI - 2 π /l is the residual dispersion wave\n\n\nvector ( l is the period of the poling) In the limit of small cavity loss α S <<1, the\n\n\nsignal field has almost constant power For a Gaussian pump input, the lowest\n\ntransverse signal mode has largest gain, and therefore reaches threshold first We\n\nfound that the threshold for the first higher radial signal mode is about four times\n\nhigher than for the lowest mode Our model therefore approximates the signal field\n\nby a Gaussian with constant power In this case, the relationship between pump\n\ninput power and idler output power is linear, to zeroth order in the cavity loss α S From photon conservation, the first order increment in signal power is then found\n\nto be proportional to the idler output and hence to the pump input Equating this to\n\nthe round-trip cavity loss determines the pump input power as a function of signal\n\npower [2] In the limit of small signal power, or small pump depletion, this gives\n\nthe threshold pump power Pthr In order to understand the influence of dispersion and pump power on the mode\n\ncontent of the idler and pump, it is instructive to consider a mode expansion of the\n\nfields AF into radially symmetric modes BFn [11,12] For a zero order signal\n\n\nmode with constant coefficient, the following coupled mode equations result [12]:\n\n# Σ\n\nAF(x,y,z) = aFn(z) BFn(x,y,z),\n\nn\n\n# daIn/dz = Σ cnm aPm aS0*, (2 a)\n\n\nm\n\n# daPm/dz = Σ cnm* aIn aS0 (2 b)\n\n\nn\n\n\nIf pump, signal and idler modes have equal confocal parameter and waist\n\n\nlocation, the coupling coefficient cnm takes the form\n\n# cnm = dmn exp(j Φ )/ √ 1+(z/z0) [2], (3)\n\n\nΦ = z ∆ + (2n+1-2m)arctan(z/z0) ≅ ( ∆ '+1+2n-2m) (z/z0),\n\n\nd10 = (1- λ P/ λ I) d00, d11 = ( λ P/ λ I) d00,  d01 = 0 Here z0 is the Raleigh range, ∆ ' = z0 ∆, and the coefficient d00 is independent of\n\n\nz The approximate form of the phase angle Φ given above is valid for z/z0 << 1 At threshold and with a zero order pump at input (m=0), the effect of the z\ndependent phase factor is to favor the n=0 idler mode for ∆ ' = -1 and the n=1 mode\n\nfor ∆ ' = -3 Lowest threshold will occur for -3 < ∆ ' < -1 The amplitude of the zero\n\nidler mode (n=0) will be largest, the amplitude of the first mode (n=1) will be\n\nsmaller, while the amplitudes of higher modes (n>1) will be suppressed by the\n\nlarger phase mismatch Above threshold, the mode content of the idler will be modified by the higher\n\npump modes (m>0) generated by pump depletion However, since d0m=0, such\n\n\npump modes are generated only by higher signal modes (n>0) Unless ∆ ' assumes\n\nlarge negative values, these have lower amplitude Furthermore, the coefficients\n\ndnm, n>0, are small Thus, we expect the idler mode content to depend only\n\n\nweakly on the pump power Our model calculations involve a numerical integration of the coupled wave\n\nequations 1 b and 1 c, and of the coupled mode equations 2 The integration of\n\nequations 2 uses a second order Runge Kutta algorithm, for the case of zero order\n\nmodes only (m,n=0; single mode approximation SMA) and for both the zero and\n\nfirst order radial modes (m,n=0,1; two mode approximation TMA) The integration of 1 b and 1 c uses a split-step algorithm, in which an explicit\n\nhalf-step of parametric conversion is followed by a full step of diffraction and\n\nimplicit half-step of conversion The diffraction step uses the Cayley-transform\n\n[13] of a discretized version of the radial Laplacian, which conserves photon\n\n\nnumber exactly The program was validated by propagating Gaussian modes\n\nwithout conversion, and beams with negligible diffraction and full conversion Other numerical results were validated by reducing the radial and longitudinal\n\nstep-sizes by a factor 0 5, giving agreement of better than 0 1% in beam\n\namplitudes The models refer to a traveling wave cavity, zero walk-off, equal confocal\n\nparameter for pump and signal, crystal length L equal to the confocal parameter b\n\n= 2z0 and waist locations at the center of the crystal Wavelengths are 1 064 µ m\n\n\nfor the pump and 3 25 µ m for the idler Pump power P and dispersion ∆ are\n\nreported as dimensionless parameters P' and ∆ '=z0 ∆ :\n\n\nP = α S P0 P',\n\n\nP0 = ε 0 c nP nS nI c [3] /( 32 p [2] ω S ω I d [2] z0 kP ) With this unit of power, the threshold parameter Pthr' = Pthr/( α SP0) is related to\n\n\nthe threshold function h of [8] by:\n\n\nPthr' =0 25 (z0/L)(1+ λ S/ λ P)/h For the SMA, the threshold parameter Pthr' is given in terms of the Boyd\n\nKleinman gain reduction factor hm [7] as:\n\n\nPthr' = 0 5 (z0/L)( λ I λ S/ λ P [2] )/hm Figure 1 shows the threshold parameter Pthr' as a function of the dispersion\n\n\nparameter ∆ ' The SMA gives minimal threshold at ∆ '=-0 86, in good agreement\n\nwith the discussion above The TMA and the numerical model give minimal\n\n\nthreshold parameter P' for ∆ '=-1 30 The TMA agrees very well with the numerical\n\nmodel for the range of ∆ ' considered The SMA agrees with these for ∆ '>-0 4, but\n\ngives higher threshold parameter for smaller values of ∆ ' The minimal threshold\n\nparameter is P' = 1 19 for the numerical model and the TMA, and 1 46 for the\n\nSMA The corresponding values for the gain reduction factors h and hm are h =\n\n\n0 26 and hm = 0 778 This agrees with the published values in [8] and [7] To determine the actual threshold, the wavelength dependence of both the\n\ndispersion parameter ∆ ' and the resonator loss α S needs to be considered The\n\n\nsignal wavelength will adjust to a value which gives lowest threshold Pthr=\n\n\nα SPthr'P0 If α S is, within a certain range, independent of wavelength, minimal\n\n\nthreshold occurs at a wavelength giving the optimal value of ∆ ' = -1 30 If α S has a\n\n\nminimum at some other wave length, minimal threshold will occur at\n\ncorrespondingly different values of ∆ ' Wavelength acceptance bandwidths for variations in ∆ ' have been given in [4]\n\nfor a PPNL crystal of length L=1cm For the d33 coefficient and a shift in ∆ ' of 1 0\n\n\nabove and below the optimal value, the acceptance bandwidth is 7 nm According\n\nto the plane-wave approximation (PWA)[9], such a shift leads to an increase in\n\nthreshold power by a factor of 1",
    "According\n\nto the plane-wave approximation (PWA)[9], such a shift leads to an increase in\n\nthreshold power by a factor of 1 41 Our numerical model predicts a smaller\n\nincrease, by a factor of about 1 20 20 Figure 2 shows the maximal pump depletion as a function of dispersion The\n\nSMA predicts 100% depletion at ∆ '=-0 86 and a pump power of 2 47 times above\n\nthreshold This is the same pump power ratio as that predicted by the PWA [9]\n\nBoth the numerical model and the TMA predict maximal depletion of about 95% at\n\n∆ '=-1 30 and a pump power of 2 67 above threshold This is in good agreement\n\nwith the experiment reported in [6], which found maximal depletion of about 93%\n\nbetween 2 This is in good agreement\n\nwith the experiment reported in [6], which found maximal depletion of about 93%\n\nbetween 2 6 and 3 7 times above threshold The optimal values of the dispersion\n\nparameter ∆ ' are the same as those found for minimal threshold As above,\n\nnumerical model and TMA agree very well, while the SMA predicts lower\n\nconversion and higher pump requirements for ∆ '<-0 8 For a shift in ∆ ' by 1 For a shift in ∆ ' by 1 0\n\n\nbelow and above optimum, our numerical model predicts a reduction of maximal\n\npump depletion to 81% and 75%, while the SMA gives 69% and 68% The PWA\n\ngives 66% in both cases These reductions in threshold and increases in pump depletion, as compared to\n\nthe PWA and SMA, are a consequence of the variable mode structure of the idler\n\nbeam, as discussed above As ∆ ' is shifted away from the optimal value, any\n\nreduction in gain for one of the modes is partially offset by an increase in gain for\n\nother modes, leading to a strong dependence of the idler mode content on ∆ ' Figure 3 shows the relative power in the idler modes n=0,1 and n>1 at threshold\n\nas functions of ∆ ' As predicted, the n=0 mode dominates for small negative and\n\npositive values of ∆ ', while the n=1 mode becomes increasingly stronger for larger\n\nnegative values, and dominates for ∆ '<-2 4 For the optimal value ∆ '=-1 3, the\n\nmode n=0 contains 77% of the idler power, the mode n=1 contains 22%, and\n\nmodes n>1 contain 1% If the focal point z=z'z0 and the Raleigh range zI=zI'z0\n\n\nof the idler modes are adjusted, to minimize the relative power in modes n>1, such\n\nmodes contain no more than 2% of the total power For example, at ∆ '=-2 3, for\n\nmodes with focus at z'=1 0 and zI'=1 0, the relative power in modes n=0,1 and n>1\n\n\nis 51%, 44% and 5%, while for the adjusted modes with focus at z'=1 04 and\n\nzI'=0 74, the relative power is 65%, 34% and 1% At ∆ '=-1 3, the adjusted modes\n\n\nhave focus at z'=1 04, Raleigh range zI'=0 94 and contain 80% for n=0, 20% for\n\n\nn=1 and less than 1% for n>1 These values are very close to the values obtained\n\nfor the original set of modes Figure 4 finally shows the idler mode content above threshold as a function of\n\npump power, for adjusted modes, at ∆ '=-2 3, -1 3 and -0 3 Fig 4 a shows the\n\nrelative power in the mode n=1, fig 4",
    "4 b shows the relative phase of modes n=0 and\n\nn=1 in degrees, and fig b shows the relative phase of modes n=0 and\n\nn=1 in degrees, and fig 4 4 c shows the location of the mode waist The relative\n\npower in the mode n=1 is seen to be almost independent of pump power, but\n\ndepends strongly on dispersion This strong dependence of higher mode amplitudes\n\non the dispersive phase mismatch was also observed in the experimental and\n\nnumerical studies reported in [10] The relative phase, which determines the beam\n\n\nradius in the far-field region, vanishes at threshold and increases in absolute value\n\nwith pump power This leads to an increase of the far-field beam radius with pump\n\npower The location of the waist shifts towards the entry face of the crystal (z'=0),\n\nas the pump power increases The Raleigh range of the adjusted modes is almost\n\nindependent of pump power, but strongly dependent upon dispersion It ranges\n\nfrom zI'= 0 74 at threshold to 0 72 at maximal depletion for ∆ '=-2 3, from 0 94 to\n\n\n0 93 for ∆ '=-1 3 and from 1 24 to 1 26 at ∆ '=-0 3 3 In summary, the models studied here demonstrate that the idler output of a cw,\n\nlow loss SRO with collinear beams contains higher transverse modes with\n\nappreciable amplitude, with most of the higher mode content in the first radial\n\nmode The mode content depends strongly on dispersion, but only weakly on pump\n\npower Furthermore, the variable mode content of the idler leads to lower threshold\n\nand in higher conversion efficiency for larger negative values of the dispersion\n\nparameter ∆ ' than those predicted by the single-mode or plane-wave\n\napproximations The price paid for this is a higher content of radial modes n>0 in\n\nthe idler output It is a pleasure to acknowledge Walt Bosenberg at Lightwave Electronics for\n\ndiscussions about the subject of this paper, and for making preprints available **References**\n\n\n[1]S T Yang, R C Eckardt, R L Byer, Opt Lett 18, 971 (1993),\n\n[2]S T Yang, R C Eckardt, R L Byer, J Opt Soc Am B 10, 1684 (1993),\n\n[3]S T Yang, R C Eckardt, R L Byer, Opt Lett 19, 475 (1993),\n\n[4]L E Myers, R C Eckardt, M M Fejer, R L Byer, W R Bosenberg, J W Pierce,\n\nOpt Soc Am B 12, 2102 (1995),\n\n[5]W R Bosenberg, A Drobshoff, J L Alexander, L E Myers, R L Byer,\n\nOpt Lett",
