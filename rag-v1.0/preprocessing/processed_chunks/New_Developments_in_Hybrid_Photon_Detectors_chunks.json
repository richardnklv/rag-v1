    "NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN HYBRID PHOTON DETECTORS [a]\n\n\nDANIEL FERENC\n\nDiv PPE,\nCERN,\n1211-Geneva,\nSwitzerland\n\nE-mail: Daniel Ferenc@CERN ch\n\n\nNew developments in HPD design are presented, triggered by applications in high\nenergy physics and astrophysics The presented HPD designs are based on three\ninnovations (i) In order to achieve the highest possible surface coverage in a RICH\ndetector, we introduced a photoelectron focussing method which is efficient to the\nperiphery of the photocathode (ii) To prevent positive ion feedback in HPDs, we\nintroduced a permanent potential barrier in front of the anode (iii) To replace a\ntransmittive by a reflective photocathode, we arrived at a conceptually new HPD\ndesign with surprisingly good imaging characteristics, high quantum efficiency and\nlow cost 1 Introduction\n\n\nWith the onset of new technologies, Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPDs) became\nthe most favourable option for detection of Cherenkov photons in large area\nRing Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors Modern HPD detectors comprise\nhigh quantum efficiency, high photoelectron collection efficiency and sharp image reproduction We present some new developments in HPDs, of particular\nimportance for applications in RICH detectors The goals achieved in the\npresented HPD designs are:\n\n\n1 minimized dead area of individual HPDs, and consequently maximized\nactive area of a RICH detector, 81% in a hexagonal HPD packing,\n\n\n2 protection against the positive ion feedback, particularly important in\ngamma ray astronomy, and\n\n\n3 application of a low cost and high quantum efficiency reflective photocathode in an HPD For all the electron optics simulations presented, the SIMION 3D software [1] has\nbeen used In the figures presented, only functional elements (conductors) are\n\n\na Presented at the conference NEW DETECTORS, 36th WORKSHOP of the INFN\nELOISATRON PROJECT, ETTORE MAJORANA CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC CULTURE, Erice, Trapani, Sicily, November 1-7, 1997 To appear in the proceedings, World\nScientific, Editors C Williams and T Ypsilantis 1\n\n\nshown Electrons are simulated with the initial energy of 0 25 eV and emission\nangles +45 [◦], -45 [◦] and 0 [◦] relative to the normal 2 “Killing the dead area”\n\n\nThe most important problem in the integration of HPDs into a matrix of a\nlarge-surface RICH detector is the low overall photon-sensitive surface coverage, caused by a typically high HPD dead area HPDs have usually been\ndesigned as stand-alone devices, and very little, if any care has been taken\nof the relationship between the physical and the sensitive surface areas In\nthose applications when the Cherenkov photon detection pixel size of 1-2 cm\nis sufficiently small, one can use single-pixel HPDs (without internal imaging)\nand take care of the large dead area by focussing the light to the sentive area\nby the means of lenses or Winstone cones In the applications which require\na smaller pixel size (e g 1 mm), one has to use large diameter HPDs with\ninternal imaging side, photoelectrons are focussed onto the silicon-pad detector on the right side Photoelectrons emerging from the periphery of the photocathode are incorrectly focussed Electrodes\nare kept at the following potentials, from left to right, respectively: -20 kV, -15 kV, -11 kV,\n-4 7 kV and 0 V Electrons are simulated with an initial energy of 0 25 eV and an emission\nangle of +45 [◦], -45 [◦] and 0 [◦] relative to the normal Proximity-focussing HPD designed for the LHCb experiment [2], is an example of a large imaging HPD (Fig",
    "Proximity-focussing HPD designed for the LHCb experiment [2], is an example of a large imaging HPD (Fig 1) 1) It has been conceptually designed to\nhave a small dead area, for close hexagonal packing 2\n\n\nFigure 2: Incorrect electron focussing close to the periphery of the photocathode is due to\nthe small radius of curvature of equipotential lines Figure 3: The new electrode allows the potential lines to be conducted out from the HPD\nthrough the created slot, curing the unwanted strong curvature of the equipotential lines\nseen in Fig Figure 3: The new electrode allows the potential lines to be conducted out from the HPD\nthrough the created slot, curing the unwanted strong curvature of the equipotential lines\nseen in Fig 3 3\n\n\nPhotons enter the HPD detector from the left side, and photoelectrons\n(emerging from the photocathode on the internal surface of the entrance window) undergo acceleration and (electrostatic) focalization onto the silicon-pad\ndetector on the right side There is a good mapping between the image on\nthe photocathode and the projected image on the pad detector, except for\nthe region close to the periphery of the photocathode Although the physical\nshape of this HPD is optimized for close packing (the photocathode has been\nextended towards the periphery as much as possible), there is still a rather\nlarge functionally dead area Figure 4: An appropriate focussing of all electrons, including those from the edge of the\nphotocathode, results from the application of a new electrode Potential lines are “conducted” out from the tube through the slot between this electrode and the window support Electrodes are kept at the following potentials, from left to right, respectively: -20 kV, -19 45\nkV, -15 kV, -11 kV, -4 7 kV and 0 V The reason for the failure becomes evident from Fig 2",
    "2 Equipotential lines\nhave a rather small radius of curvature close to the edge of the photocathode Photoelectrons emitted from that region are therefore too strongly accelerated\nalong the potential gradient, i e towards the center of the HPD To fix this problem, one should reduce the curvature of the potential distribution One is tempted to redesign the window supporting structure and let\npotential lines leave the tube, but for constructional reasons (related in fact\nto the maximal exclusion of the mechanical dead area), this was not possible Therefore we searched for another solution with the basic idea to reduce the\nfield curvature by “conducting” some of the potential lines out from the tube,\n\n\n4\n\n\naround the metallic window support The solution was found in the creation of\na slot which acts as a “potential-conductor”, see Fig The solution was found in the creation of\na slot which acts as a “potential-conductor”, see Fig 3 3 The slot was created\nby the insertion of a specially shaped new electrode The unwanted potential\nlines are indeed conducted away through the slot between the new electrode\nand the body of the tube, and the resulting field in the problematic peripheral\nregion has evidently lost its strong curvature, see Fig The unwanted potential\nlines are indeed conducted away through the slot between the new electrode\nand the body of the tube, and the resulting field in the problematic peripheral\nregion has evidently lost its strong curvature, see Fig 3, Fig 4 Figure 5: A cross-focussing 5-inch diameter HPD, with superior imaging characteristics Electrodes are kept at the following potentials, from left to right, respectively: -20 kV, -19 97\nkV, -19 4 kV, +100 V, and 0 V The same method has been successfully applied in a different design, the\nso called cross-focussing HPD design, shown in Fig",
    "The same method has been successfully applied in a different design, the\nso called cross-focussing HPD design, shown in Fig 5 This HPD can also be\nhexagonally packed with the same surface coverage of 81% Apart from providing a much narrower spread of photoelectrons on the\nsilicon pad detector, and thus a superior imaging performance, this design\nalso provides a simple way to apply the protection against the positive ion\nfeedback [5], which is the subject of the following section 3 Potential barrier - protection against the ion feedback\n\n\nAir Cherenkov Telescopes (ACT) have been considered the ultimate instruments for the ground based detection of high energy cosmic gamma rays [3][,][4] 5\n\n\n(0 V) Ions emerge from the surface of the anode (right) and become accelerated towards\nthe photocathode (left), eventually producing damage and operational noise electrode and the anode a potential barrier is established (see Fig 8) to repel back the\npositive ions emerging from the anode surface 6\n\n\nIn order to lower the energy threshold for the detection of cosmic gamma rays\ndown to 20 GeV – to explore the only unexplored window in cosmic electromagnetic spectrum (20 GeV to 300 GeV) – one should both increase the detector\narea, and achieve an unprecedented photon detection with single photon sensitivity and very high efficiency Considering photon sensors, HPDs currently\npresent the most promising solution However, commercial devices have still\nsome serious drawbacks and need further improvement In particular, it is very\nimportant to reduce the internal instrumental noise below the present limits,\nbecause other sources of noise in imaging air Cherenkov detectors (like the\nnight sky background) are irreducible The presence of positive ions in a vacuum tube is particularly devastating because the acceleration and subsequent dumping of positive ions into a\nphotocathode leads both to creation of noise through electrons released, and\nto a damage of the photocathode [6][,][7] In the high-vacuum tubes the vast majority of positive ions do not originate from residual gas, but rather from the\nimpact of accelerated photoelectrons on the surface of the anode Cesium ions\nare particularly abundant because they usually spread inside tubes during and\nafter the manufacturing of photocathodes Trajectories of singly charged positive ions are shown in Fig 6, emerging\nfrom the anode at normal incidence with energy 44 eV Note that the angular\nand energetic distributions of positive ions are at this point unknown We have\nworked out a measurement scheme, but at the time being we are using only a\nvery rough estimate that the ions could reach an energy of about 30 eV It has been previously demonstrated 5 that the insertion of an electrostatic potential barrier close to the anode solves the ion feedback problem Apart from being complete, this solution is easy to implement and it preserves\ncylindrical symmetry of the device As demonstrated in Fig 7, the functionality of the conical barrier–electrode\nis simple: being kept at a potential somewhat higher than the anode potential,\nit breaks down the monotonous decrease of the potential for positive particles\ntowards the photocathode, and creates a potential barrier in front of the anode The barrier prevents positive ions from penetrating further towards the\nphotocathode The potential distribution in front of the anode plane is shown\nin a magnified view in Fig 8",
    "8 Trajectories of singly charged positive ions are\nsimulated with identical initial conditions like before The precision of the potential on the barrier–electrode, required for stable electron focussing, is not a critical issue – variations of even 10% on the\npotential will leave the electron focussing essentially unchanged [5][,][8] The most\ncommon voltage supply may be therefore used to bias the barrier–electrode,\nwhile a separate, unipolar and very stable voltage supply could be used to bias\n\n\n7\n\n\nthe focussing electrodes Figure 8: Potential distribution in front of the anode plane of HPD from Fig 7 7 Positive\nions of energy E ion =44 eV and emission angle normal to the anode surface start “climbing”\nthe potential barrier (E b =45 eV) but eventually become repelled 4 HPD with a reflective photocathode\n\n\nSemi-transparent photocathodes, commonly used in photon detectors, present\na problem per se: they need to be opaque for photons, but at the same time\ntransmittive for photoelectrons An alternative solution is to use a photocathode in a reflective mode, i e in a configuration when photoelectrons emerge from the same surface through\nwhich photons enter A considerably higher quantum efficiency is granted, but\nperhaps equally important, the photocathode manufacturing process is not any\nmore strictly constrained to extremely high tolerances In particular, there is\nno need to perform some of the most complicated stages in the processing\nof the III-V photocathodes (like e In particular, there is\nno need to perform some of the most complicated stages in the processing\nof the III-V photocathodes (like e g GaAsP), namely the attachment of the\nepitaxially grown surface onto the entrance window of the phototube, and then\nthe removal (usually by etching) of the substrate from the opposite side Motivated by these considerations, we have developed a conceptually new\nHPD device - the imaging HPD with reflective photocathode, see Fig",
