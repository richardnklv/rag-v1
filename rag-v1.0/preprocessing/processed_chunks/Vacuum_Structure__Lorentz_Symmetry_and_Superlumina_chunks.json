    "Some cosmological implications of superluminal particles are also discussed 1\n\n\n1 1\n\n\n1 VACUUM EXCITATIONS AND ”ELEMENTARY” PARTICLES\n\n\nSparnay and Lamoreaux [1] have experimentally confirmed the Casimir effect [2 - 4]\nbased on the quantum-field-theoretical interpretation of elementary particles, which states\nthat quantum fields are harmonic oscillators in vacuum and have therefore a nonzero\nground energy Thus, the so-called ”elementary particles” are actually quantum oscillators\nof vacuum degrees of freedom and conventional quantum field theory is based on the\nharmonic approximation to these oscillators Quantum mechanics seems to arise at a\ndeeper level than the description of the so-called ”free particles” This raises a fundamental\nquestion: can matter be understood just from a phenomenological study of the excitations\nof vacuum Obvioulsy, the matter forming a ionic crystal cannot be described just in\nterms of the crystal phonon spectrum On the other hand, our present knowledge of\nvacuum excitations (quarks, leptons, gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, string models )\nis likely to contain, if correctly interpreted, important information on vacuum dynamics\nitself A most remarkable fact is that all the above-mentioned excitations of vacuum seem\n\nto have the same critical speed in this medium The dynamical origin of such a symmetry\nis far from trivial if we adopt the philosophy that the apparent structure of space and time,\nas seen by matter, is actually determined by the properties of matter itself (e The dynamical origin of such a symmetry\nis far from trivial if we adopt the philosophy that the apparent structure of space and time,\nas seen by matter, is actually determined by the properties of matter itself (e g [5 - 11])",
    "[5 - 11]) This would not really be an unorthodox approach, as standard (inflationary) cosmology\ngenerates space from the expansion (creation) of matter This would not really be an unorthodox approach, as standard (inflationary) cosmology\ngenerates space from the expansion (creation) of matter 1a 1a Vacuum and particles: an analogy with the Bravais lattice\n\n\nTo understand, in the absence of absolute prescriptions from an intrinsic space-time\ngeometry, the meaning of this apparent universality of the critical speed in vacuum, we can\nattempt a simple analogy with solid state physics Assume a classical system similar to\nthe monoatomic one-dimensional Bravais lattice [12] with a very large number of coupled\noscillators regularly spaced by a, π times the inverse of the critical wave vector k 0 (k 0\nand −k 0 leading to the same wave function) On each site n, a complex parameter φ(n)\nsatisfies an equation implying nearest-neighbour coupling, i e :\n\n\nd [2] /dt [2] [φ (n)] = K [2 φ (n) − φ (n − 1) − φ (n + 1)] − ω rest [2] [φ] (1)\n\n\nwhich admits, for wave vector k (−k 0 ≤ k ≤ k 0 ), solutions of the type:\n\n\nφ k (n, t) = φ k (0) exp [i (k n a − ω t)] (2)\n\n\nwith\n\n\nω [2] (k) = 2 K [1 − cos (k a)] + ω rest [2] = 4 K sin [2] (ka/2) + ω rest [2] (3)\n\n\nwhich, at low k and taking positive energy solutions, can be written as:\n\n\nω (k) ≃ [K (a k) [2] + ω rest [2] []] [1][/][2] (4)\n\n\nas in standard special relativity We expect ω rest = 0 as long as global fluctuations have\nno energy Each plane wave φ k (n, t) can be viewed as a complex harmonic oscillator The\n\n\n2\n\n\nspeed dω/dk is basically determined by the spring constant K and the critical wavelength\nk 0 = π a [−][1]",
    "The\n\n\n2\n\n\nspeed dω/dk is basically determined by the spring constant K and the critical wavelength\nk 0 = π a [−][1] With the above approximations, and interpreting the lattice as the physical\nvacuum, a classical massive field is obtained which can be quantized to give a charged\nmassive particle By this simple procedure, a particle has been generated whose critical\nspeed in vacuum is explicitly related to dynamical parameters of this vacuum (K, a) If, as it seems to occur in our world, many particles have the same critical speed in\nvacuum, they must correspond to oscillators with the same values of these dynamical\nparameters The observed symmetries must correspond to symmetries of the inner vacuum\ndynamics (preonic symmetry, supersymmetry ) and may survive beyond the scales where\nthe particles cease to exist Instead of a complex parameter, we can take in the previous\nexample a unitary operator u (n, n − 1) associated to links between sites If u (n, n − 1)\nbelongs to the unitary group U (N), λ is a hermitic generator of U (N) and α a real\nparameter, the plane wave:\n\n\nu k (n, n − 1 ; t) = exp [i (k n a − ω t)] exp (i α λ) (5)\n\n\nsatisfies the equation:\n\n\nd [2] /dt [2] [u (n, n − 1)] = K [2 u (n, n − 1) − u (n − 1, n − 2) − u (n + 1, n)] (6)\n\n\nfor:\nω [2] (k) = 2 K [1 − cos (k a)] = 4 K sin [2] (ka/2) (7)\n\n\nThe hermitic vector field, which satisfies (6) and (7) similar to u, is actually:\n\n\nA (n, n − 1) = (2i) [−][1] [u (n, n − 1) − u (n − 1, n)] (8)\n\n\nwhere u (n − 1, n) = u [†] (n, n − 1) A is hermitic and contains both positive and\nnegative frequencies:\n\n\n2 A k (n, n − 1) = a [†] k [exp][ [][−][i][ (][k n a][ −] [ω t][)] +][ a] [k] [ exp][ [][i][ (][k n a][ −] [ω t][)]] (9)\n\n\nwhere a k = − i exp (i α λ) In this way, nine massless bosons can be generated, as\nλ varies, possibly equivalent to a set of U(N) gauge bosons Matter fields will exhibit\n(up to a mass) the same relation between energy and momentum as gauge fields if they\noscillate with the same parameters K and a as the internal symmetry links, which can be\na natural assumption if in both cases we are dealing with nearest-neighbour interactions of\nthe same family of degrees of freedom In this scenario, the violation of Lorentz symmetry\nintroduced at high energy by equations (3) and (7) will not be accompanied by a breaking\nof the universality of the relation between energy and momentum in the zero-mass limit Although masses and other related phenomena will introduce low-energy corrections to\nthis universality, the high-momentum dynamics can keep it unbroken An ansatz for a\ngeneral formula describing kinematics in the vacuum rest frame can be as before:\n\n\nω [2] (k) = 2 K [1 − cos (k a)] + (2π) [2] h [−][2] E rest [2] (10)\n\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant and E rest the rest energy of the particle The ”speed of\nlight”, as measured at low energy in the limit k → 0, is c = K [1][/][2] a The inertial mass\nof the particle in the same limit is, as usual, m = E rest c [−][2] 3\n\n\nIn such an analogy, no basic principle would prevent the vacuum from having other\nsets of degrees of freedom oscillating with different values of a and K These degrees of\nfreedom may generate superluminal sectors of matter, as considered in [5 - 11] If K i\nand a i are the values of K and a for the i-th superluminal sector, we may try for these\nsuperluminal particles in the vacuum rest frame the ansatz:\n\n\nω [2] (k) = 2 K i [1 − cos (k a i )] + (2π) [2] h [−][2] E rest [2] (11)\n\n\nwhere, from [5 - 10], the mass of the particle is related to its rest energy by the relation\nE rest = m c [2] i [, and][ c] [i] = K i [1][/][2] a i = π K i k i [−][1], where k i is the critical wavelength Interaction between different dynamical sectors would then lead to energy and momentum\ntransfer between different kinds of excitation modes As stressed in [5 - 11], the superluminal particles we consider would not be tachyons and would have quite different physical\nproperties from those predicted for tachyonic objects [13] Contrary to tachyons, the\nnew superluminal particles necessarily violate the relativity principle [14] and would produce ”Cherenkov” radiation (spontaneous emission of particles with lower critical speed)\nin vacuum (see [5 - 11], and also [15]) They can play an important role in high-energy\nphenomena, as well as in cosmology, and yield detectable signatures at accelerators (e g LHC) or in cosmic ray experiments (e g AMANDA [16])",
    "AMANDA [16]) Obviously, kinematics from (10) and (11) is just a rough example parameterizing possible trends of scenarios where Lorentz invariance is only a low-energy limit and ”ordinary”\nparticles (those with critical speed in vacuum equal to c, the speed of light) cease to exist at\ndistance scales below a However, it may allow for useful discussions of Lorentz symmetry\nviolation and of other related phenomena Consequences in cosmology can be important,\nespecially for the Big Bang scenario [17, 18] Quantum field theory [19 - 21] should take\nthese penomena into account, especially when discussing cutoffs and renormalization, but\nits validity is not in principle altered by their existence Contrary to tachyons [22, 23],\nthe proposed superluminal particles would not violate causality [10] From formula (10),\nthe velocity of an ”ordinary” particle would be (E = energy, p = momentum):\n\n\nv = dE/dp = dω/dk = K [1][/][2] c ω [−][1] sin (k a) (12)\n\n\nwhich tends to zero as k approaches ±πa [−][1] Thus, a particle with the highest permitted energy and wave vector would be at rest (zero speed) with respect to the vacuum rest frame, even if it has a high momentum In this limit, the frequency tends to\nω [max] = [4 K + (2π) [2] h [−][2] E rest [2] []] [1][/][2] [ Similar expressions can be obtained for superlumi-]\nnal particles In the early Universe, the characteristic phase transition temperature sclaes\n\n[2, 9] would be:\nT 0 ≈ k B [−][1] [h K] [1][/][2] (13)\n\n\nfor the ordinary sector, k B being the Boltzmann constant, and:\n\n\nT i ≈ k B [−][1] [h K] i [1][/][2] (14)\n\n\nfor each superluminal sector The cosmological phase transition temperatures depend, for\neach sector, on the sectorial spring constant and not on the critical wavelength scale An\n\n\n4\n\n\ninteresting scenario would be, for all i : a i = a ; K i ≫ K",
    "An\n\n\n4\n\n\ninteresting scenario would be, for all i : a i = a ; K i ≫ K Then, the ”Planck scale”\nmay still make sense as a distance scale, but the ”Planck temperature” (equivalent to a\nDebye temperature) would be different for different sectors Above T 0, only superluminal\nparticles would in principle exist and ”Cherenkov” radiation in vacuum may have been inhibited by the very short time scale In this case, the Universe would have quickly cooled\ndown just after having reached each critical temperature (T 0 and the T i ’s) Another possible scenario would be: a i ≫ a ; c i ≫ c which requires very large values of K i but is\nnot prevented by any basic principle In such case, a question arises: since superluminal\nparticles remain ”elementary” at scales where the internal structure of ordinary particles\n(quarks, leptons, gauge bosons ) shows up, are the former part of the constituents of the\nvacuum structure generating the latter If the answer is positive for one of the superluminal sectors, transparency of vacuum with respect to superluminal particles of this sector\nwould not be a trivial problem Superluminal particles raise several fundamental questions\nconcerning their origin and properties as possible components of vacuum dynamics Superluminal particles raise several fundamental questions\nconcerning their origin and properties as possible components of vacuum dynamics 1b 1b Further analogies\n\n\nThe analogy with solid state physics raises in itself two interesting questions:\n\n\n  - Do umklapp processes [12] take place at very high energy In such processes, the\n\n⃗\ntotal momentum would be conserved only up to an integer multiple of h a [−][1] u for ordinary\nparticles, and of h a [−] i [1] ⃗u for superluminal particles, where ⃗u is a unitary vector This (or\na more involved scenario) cannot be excluded, as there is no guarantee that translation\ninvariance remains valid below the a and a i distance scales Dynamics would then depend\ncrucially on the topology of momentum space This topological space can be the product\nof three circles like in a crystal lattice But it can also be, for instance, a sphere with\nantipodes identified on its surface (i e k 0 ⃗u = − k 0 ⃗u for any unitary vector ⃗u) Then,\nrotation invariance would be preserved and expression (10) can naturally apply to three\nspace dimensions We can also consider a momentum topology where all points on the\nsurface | ⃗u | = k 0 of the momentum sphere would be identified to a single point (making\nthe momentum space topologically similar to the SU(2) group) Umklapp processes would\nmodify the thermal conductivity of the very early Universe, and make more difficult heat\nexchanges between different regions of space at high temperature - Is the ”acoustic branch” [12] the only dynamical branch of ordinary or superluminal\nparticles The question is not merely academic, as the contrary may imply the existence\nof ”optical” particles with: a) negative inertial mass at zero momentum, but positive rest\nenergy; b) minimum energy at maximum momentum Such particles would be very heavy\nand, at high energy, undergo a repulsive acceleration in the presence of a static, attractive,\ngravitational feld They may have crucially influenced the expansion of the Universe ”Optical” particles can be generated replacing in the previous analogy the monoatomic\nlattice by a diatomic one We would then be led in the vacuum rest frame, in a similar\nway to [12] in one space dimension and assuming rotation invariance when generalizing\nthe ansatz to the three-dimensional case, to the frequency spectrum:\n\n\nω [2] = K 0 ± K 1 (k) (15)\n\n\n5\n\n\nwith:\nK 0 = K + G + λ 1 + λ 2 (16)\n\nK 1 = [K [2] + G [2] + 2 K G cos (ka) + (λ 1 − λ 2 ) [2] ] [1][/][2] (17)\n\n\nwhere 2λ 1, 2λ 2 are monoatomic elastic constants similar to ω rest [2] [in the previous example]\nand K, G govern nearest-ion interactions [12] All these constants are positive in realistic\nexamples based on harmonic oscillators The solution with the − sign (”acoustic” particles)\ncan be dealt with in a similar way to the monoatomic case, and leads to a massless particle\nif λ 1 = λ 2 = 0 Writing δ = λ 1 − λ 2, the solution with a + sign (the ”optical\nbranch”) has rest (zero momentum) frequency:\n\n\nE rest (optical) = (2π) [−][1] h [K 0 + (K [2] + G [2] + 2 K G + δ [2] ) [1][/][2] ] [1][/][2] (18)\n\n\nand negative values of d [2] ω/dk [2] In the limit where k approaches ±π a [−][1], the energy\napproaches the positive value:\n\n\nE min (optical) = (2π) [−][1] h [K 0 + (K [2] + G [2] − 2 K G + δ [2] ) [1][/][2] ] [1][/][2] (19)\n\n\nand the particle would also be at rest (zero speed) in this limit, where it has its minimum\npossible energy and its maximum permitted momentum Since this is the less energetic\nstate, it is likely that ”optical” particles tend to be in such a state in the present epoch There, for [⃗] k = k 0 ⃗u where ⃗u is an arbitrary unitary vector, they would have a large,\npositive inertial mass in the direction of their momentum and infinite inertial mass in\nthe two other directions More precisely, we can write for an ”optical” particle around\nmaximum wavelength [⃗] k = k 0 ⃗u submitted to a static external force the hamiltonian:\n\n\n⃗\nH = (2π) [−][1] h [K 0 + K 1 (k)] [1][/][2] + V (r) (20)\n\n\n⃗\nwhere ⃗r is the position vector and, with the relation [⃗] k = 2π h [−][1] p where ⃗p is the\nmomentum, the classical Hamilton equations:\n\n\n⃗\nv = 2π h [−][1] [ ⃗] ∇ k H = − (a k [−][1] /2) [K 0 + K 1 (k)] [−][1][/][2] sin (ka) [⃗] k dK 1 /d[cos(ka)] (21)\n\n\n⃗\nd [⃗] k/dt = − 2π h [−][1] [ ⃗] ∇ V (r) (22)\n\n\nwhere ∇ [⃗] k stands for gradient in wave vector space For a unitary vector ⃗u :\n\n\n⃗ ⃗\nd ⃗v/dt | ⃗k = k 0 ⃗u = − [2 E min (optical)] [−][1] K G [K (k 0 )] [−][1] a [2] [u ∇ [⃗] V (r)] ⃗u (23)\n\n\nTherefore, an ”optical” particle at minimum energy can be accelerated only by a force\nparallel to its momentum A condensate of ”optical” particles in vacuum may then spontaneously break rotation invariance, as ”optical” particle-antiparticle pairs would be at rest\nwith maximum momenta pointing, locally, in arbitrary directions The observed isotropy of\ncosmic microwave background radiation as well as our daily experience and the long range\nof gravitational forces seem to indicate that such an effect, as felt by ”acoustic” particles,\nmust be very small when observed at large distance scales At shorter distance scales (e g",
    "g those reached by accelerator experiments), it may be worth to perform precision tests of\nrotation invariance The threshold for ”optical” particle production would be given by the\n\n\n6\n\n\nenergy at maximum wave vector (we expect masses ≈ 10 [19] GeV c [−][2] for a ≈ 10 [−][33] cm),\nand not by the k = 0 rest energy as for ”acoustic” particles Particles of the ”acoustic\nbranch” would be faster than those of the ”optical branch”, but their maximum energy\nwould be lower than the minimum energy of ”optical” particles ”Optical” particles, or\ninstead more complicated objects, may indeed appear at very high energy as a consequence\nof nontrivial vacuum structure As they seem to be in ”one-to-one” correspondence with\n”acoustic” particles, we consider them as being part of the same dynamical sector The\nquestion arises whether such ”optical” objects, whatever they are, can play a role in the\nrenormalization of quantum field theories In any case, it seems difficult to imagine how\n”bare” particles could reasonably be defined without taking into account physics at the\nnatural cut-off scales where ”point-like” interactions do no longer make sense In principle, there is no basic reason for ”optical” particles to couple to the ”acoustic”\ngraviton in the same way as ”acoustic” particles For instance, the low-momentum Lorentz\nsymmetry becomes euclidean and with a different value of the critical speed ”Optical”\nparticles correspond to fundamentally different vacuum excitations and would not necessarily decay into ”acoustic” ones If such decays do not occur, some ”optical” particles\nmay be stable Since they are in one-to-one correspondence with ”acoustic” particles,\n”optical” particles can possibly couple to ”acoustic” internal-symmetry gauge bosons If\nordinary particles are excitations of vacuum degrees of freedom associated to a condensate\nof particles of the i-th superluminal sector and involving a long range superluminal force,\nordinary ”optical” particles at small wave vector may mix with the superluminal field, in\nthe same way as optical phonons mix with the electromagnetic field in a ionic crystal [12] This would give rise to superluminal ”polaritons” propagating in vacuum If ”optical” particles have significant couplings to ”acoustic” gravitation and internalsymmetry gauge bosons, several interesting phenomena can be expected Interactions\nbetween ”optical” and ”acoustic” particles would present rather unconventional features The low-energy hamiltonian for a system formed by an ”acoustic” particle of mass m a and\nan ”optical” particle of effective inertial mass M O will be in the vacuum rest frame:\n\n\nH ≃ p [2] a [(2][ m] [a] [)] [−][1] [ + (2][M] [O] [)] [−][1] [ (2][π a][)] [−][2] [ h] [2] [ sin] [2] [(][ka][) +][ V][ (][⃗][r][)] (24)\n\n\nwhere ⃗p a is the momentum of the ”acoustic” particle, m a its mass, M O the effective inertial\n\n⃗\nmass of the ”optical” particle, [⃗] k its wave vector, ⃗r = ⃗r a − r O, ⃗r a and ⃗r O the position\n\n⃗\nvectors of the ”acoustic” and the ”optical” particle, and V (r) the potential energy If the\n”optical” particle is close to k = k 0, we can write:\n\n\nsin [2] (k a) = sin [2] (k a − k 0 a) ≈ (k a − k 0 a) [2] (25)\n\n\nH ≃ p [2] a [(2][ m] [a] [)] [−][1] [ + (2][M] [O] [)] [−][1] [ (][p] [O] [ −] [h a] [−][1] [/][2)] [2] [ +][ V][ (][⃗][r][)] (26)\n\n\nwhere ⃗p O is the momentum of the ”optical” particle, and Hamilton equations lead to:\n\n\n⃗ ⃗\ndp O /dt = − dp a /dt = ∇ V (r) (27)\n\n\n⃗ ⃗\nv a = m [−] a [1] p a (28)\n\n\n7\n\n\n⃗\nv O = M O [−][1] (p O − h a [−][1] /2) p [−] O [1] [⃗][p] [O] (29)\n\n\nwhere ⃗v a and ⃗p O stand for the velocity of the ”acoustic” and ”optical” particle The last\nequation can be turned into:\n\n\n⃗ ⃗\np O = v O v O [−][1] [(][M] [O] [ v] [O] [) +][ h a] [−][1] [/][2)] (30)\n\n\nso that the conserved total momentum P [⃗] is given by:\n\n\n⃗\nP ≃ m a ⃗v a + M O ⃗v + h a [−][1] v O [−][1] [⃗][v] [O] [/][2] (31)\n\n\nIt directly follows from this expression that, if the momentum transfer amounts only\nto a rotation of ⃗p O, it will be mainly spent in the rotation of the zero-speed component\nof the momentum of the ”optical” particle Only a fraction ≃ 2 M O v O h [−][1] a would in\nsuch case lead to a modification the effective momentum M O v O of the ”optical” particle In the limit where the ”optical” particle is initially at rest, there will be no acceleration\nfor a transverse infinitesimal momentum transfer Thus, naive conservation laws will not\napply to the ”effective” total momentum m a ⃗v a + M O ⃗v O ”Optical” particles may be unconventional dark matter candidates playing an important role in the formation of structure in the early Universe As for ”acoustic” particles,\nannihilation may have been prevented by matter-antimatter asymmetry If such particles\nexist, are stable and have not annihilated, they will be present in the matter-dominated\nUniverse If their density is of the order of standard cosmological matter densities, and if\nthey are practically at rest with respect to the vacuum rest frame (assumed to be close\nto that defined by cosmic microwave background), they will move at a speed ≈ 2 10 [−][3] c\nwith respect to the Local Group We can then expect on earth fluxes ≈ 10 [−][6] m [−][2] year [−][1]\n\nwhich would not be unaccessible to future cosmic ray detectors An interesting question\nis whether they can be found in ”acoustic” matter If they have a significant cosmological\ndensity, couple to ”acoustic” gravitation and have accreted with ”acoustic” matter, they\nshould be present in terrestrial materials However, it should be noticed that the gravitational force they would feel on the surface of earth is ≈ 10 [12] eV m [−][1] G O,a G [−] N [1] [for a]\nmass M O ≈ 10 [−][5] gm (the mass scale suggested by the above considerations), G O,a being\nthe gravitational coupling constant between ”acoustic” and ”optical” particles, and G N\nNewton’s constant If G O,a G [−] N [1] [is not much below 1, this force may have been strong]\nenough to favour the diffusion of ”optical” particles trough terrestrial matter towards the\ncenter of the earth Dedicated experiments could, for instance, search in fine powders for\nvery heavy particles with unconventional responses to external forces 1c The low-energy limit\n\n\nThe above analogies remind simple, well-known examples of how dynamics at a small\nscale of distance (the interatomic distance) with energy scale ≈ 1 keV (T ≈ 10 [7] K)\ncan generate, and naturally protect, objects (the phonons) existing as massless excitations\ndown to microkelvin temperatures (≈ 10 [−][10] eV ) A new dynamical interpretation of\nmassless particles and gauge interactions may potentially emerge from such analogies,\nwith inner vacuum dynamics replacing the standard geometric formulation of the gauge\n\n\n8\n\n\nprinciple and chiral symmetries For instance, rather than associating gauge fields to a\nmathematical way to compare local definitions of space-time or internal symmetry frames,\nwe can admit that there is a well-defined physical way to make such comparisons but\nthat the local frames and parameters fluctuate Because of nearest-neighbour interactions,\nfluctuating dynamical links between sites are generated giving rise to the gauge bosons In the above simple-minded model of links, the masslessness of the gauge boson would\nbe equivalent to assuming that, whatever its value, no energy is spent in setting the\nmatrix u (n, n − 1) to be different from the identity provided its value is the same\nfor all links Gauge fields could possibly be interpreted as polarization states of vacuum\nwith nearest-neighbour interaction between polarizations (similar to spin systems) The\nconcept of ”vacuum polarization” already appeared long ago in quantum electrodynamics\nwithout any explicit use of a precise vacuum structure [19, 21] With more than one\nspace dimension, since the local polarization variable would naturally be a vector, we can\nassociate it with links between sites but also with the sites themselves In this last case,\nthe above u (n, n − 1) would rather become a space-vector U(N) matrix P [⃗] (n) describing\nthe polarization state of each site on the lattice The use of links or of site variables would\ndepend on the details of the dynamics and, possibly, on the scale at which the lattice is\nbuilt More fundamental is the absence of local elastic constants, such as ω rest in (1), in\norder to preserve the masslessness of the gauge bosons Apart from gravitational lenses and similar experiments able to feel the effect of dark\nmatter, all the above phenomena would remain invisible to low-energy experiments For\ninstance, in the ordinary sector with h k ≈ 1 keV/c and a ≈ 10 [−][33] cm, one has (k a) [2] ≈\n10 [−][52], which is clearly much too small to produce any detectable effect High-energy\nexperiments would be the only way to possibly reach sensitivity to this kind of Lorentz\nsymmetry violation Thus, the impressive bounds derived from low-energy experimental\ntests of Lorentz invariance (e",
    "Thus, the impressive bounds derived from low-energy experimental\ntests of Lorentz invariance (e g [24, 25]) are not incompatible with the proposed scenario A basic question can be raised: can we still justify the existence of gravity as a gauge\ninteraction, if Lorentz invariance is just a low-energy limit In the previous analogy, an\nanswer could be that local fluctuations of the vacuum rest frame and of local dynamical\nparameters exist in any case For instance, if g µν is the effective metric tensor in the lowenergy Lorentz-invariant limit of the equations of motion, a fluctuation of the coefficients of\nthe time derivative and of the nearest-neighbour interaction in (1) amounts to a fluctuation\nof the metric More generally, we can consider (1) as a particular configuration of the\nequation:\n\n\nA d [2] /dt [2] [φ (n)] + H d/dt [ φ (n + 1) − φ (n − 1)] −\n\n\n− K fl [2 φ (n) − φ (n − 1) − φ (n + 1)] − ω rest [2] [φ] = 0 (32)\n\n\nIn the continuum limit, the coefficients A = g 00, H = g 01 = g 10 and −K fl = g 11\ncan be regarded as the matrix elements of a space-time bilinear metric with equilibrium\nvalues: A = 1, H = 0 and K fl = K Then, a small local fluctuation:\n\n\nA = 1 + γ (33)\n\n\nK fl = K (1 − γ) (34)\n\n\n9\n\n\nwith γ ≪ 1 would be equivalent to a small, static gravitational field created by a far away\nsource The ”graviton” would remain massless if the local fluctuations of A, K fl and H,\nδA (n), δK fl (n) and δH (n), satisfy equations like (1) without the rest-frequency term\n(as is the case for the vibrations of a crystal, where only nearest-neighbour interactions\nplay a role) Then, gravitation would still exist even if Lorentz symmetry is no longer an\nexact linear symmetry The graviton would lead to a long-range force, as long as global\nfluctuations of A, K fl and H would cost no vibrational energy No obvious incompatibility\nseems to arise between this scenario and the violation of Lorentz symmetry at very high\nenergy, which is related to the finite value of a and, as we shall see in the next chapter,\ncan produce detectable effects even at very small values of k a 2 LORENTZ SYMMETRY VIOLATION IN HIGH-ENERGY PHYSICS\n\n\nThe study of high-energy phenomena must incorporate the fact that, if Lorentz invariance is broken, relativistics kinematics can no longer be applied As an illustrative\nexample, we shall use the kinematics derived from the analogy with the one-dimensional\nmonoatomic Bravais lattice But, obviously, our basic arguments have a more general\nvalidity Several consequences can follow from this modification of the usual framework:\n\n\n2a The GZK cutoff does no longer apply\n\n\nAssume that, in the vacuum rest frame, the kinematics of ”ordinary” particles is indeed\ngiven by (10) with universal values of K and a, and K [1][/][2] a = c As an example, we\ntake a ≃ 10 [−][33] cm and K ≃ 10 [87] s [−][2] At the distance scales associated to the highest\ncosmic ray energies, i e energy E ≈ 10 [20] eV and (k a) [2] ≈ 10 [−][17], we can expand E as\nfollows:\nE ≃ (2π) [−][1] h [K (k [2] a [2] − k [4] a [4] /12) + (2π) [2] h [−][2] E rest [2] []] [1][/][2] (35)\n\n\nand, at high energy, we can write:\n\n\nE ≃ (2π) [−][1] h c k [1 + 2π [2] (h c k) [−][2] E rest [2] [−] [k] [2] [ a] [2] [/][24]] (36)\n\n\nCorrections from Lorentz symmetry breaking are thus of order 10 [−][18], i e ≈ 100 eV This is to be compared with the term from rest energy in (36) which, for a proton and at\nthe same energy, is ≈ 10 [−][2] eV Thus, Lorentz symmetry violation can play an important\nrole in kinematics at these energies A proton with E > 10 [20] eV interacting with a cosmic\nmicrowave background photon would be sensitive to these corrections For instance, after\nhaving absorbed a 10 [−][3] eV photon moving in the opposite direction, the proton gets an\nextra 10 [−][3] eV energy, whereas its momentum is lowered by 10 [−][3] eV/c In the conventional\nscenario with exact Lorentz invariance, this is enough to allow the excited proton to decay\ninto a proton or a neutron plus a pion, losing an important part of its energy However,\nit can be checked that in our scenario with Lorentz invariance violation such a reaction is\n\nstrictly forbidden Writing for the maximum allowed energy transfer the equation:\n\n\n2π (h c) [−][1] [E (k + 2π 10 [−][3] eV/hc) + 10 [−][3] eV ] − k = δ p + δ π (37)\n\n\nwith\nδ p = (k − k π ) [2π [2] h [−][2] (k − k π ) [−][2] m [2] p [c] [2] [ −] [(][k][ −] [k] [π] [)] [2] [ a] [2] [/][24]] (38)\n\n\n10\n\n\nδ π = k π [2π [2] (h k π ) [−][2] m [2] π [c] [2] [ −] [k] π [2] [a] [2] [/][24]] (39)\n\n\nwhere m p and m π are respectively the proton and the pion mass, k π the momentum of the\nproduced pion, and the left-hand-side of the equation can be approximated by:\n\n\n2π (h c) [−][1] [E (k + 2π 10 [−][3] eV/hc) + 10 [−][3] eV ] ≈ E (k) + 2 10 [−][3] eV (40)\n\n\nit turns out that corrections due to Lorentz symmetry violation completely preclude the\nreaction Elastic p + γ scattering is permitted, but allows the proton to release only a\nsmall amount of its energy, as can be seen writing:\n\n\n2π (h c) [−][1] [E (k + 2π 10 [−][3] eV/hc) + 10 [−][3] eV ] − k = δ p + δ γ (41)\n\n\nwith δ p defined as before replacing k π by the outgoing photon wave vector k γ and:\n\n\nδ γ = − k γ [3] [a] [2] [/][24] (42)\n\n\nwhose solution is in the range k γ ≈ 10 [−][5] k Thus, the outgoing photon energy for\nan incoming 10 [20] eV proton cannot exceede ∆E [max] ≈ 10 [−][5] E = 10 [15] eV instead of\nthe value ∆E [max] ≈ 10 [19] eV obtained with exact Lorentz invariance Similar or more\n\nstringent bounds exist for channels involving lepton production Furthermore, obvious\nphase space limitations will also lower the event rate, as compared to standard calculations\nusing exact Lorentz invariance which predict photoproduction of real pions at such cosmic\nproton energies The effect seems strong enough to invalidate the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin\n(GZK) cutoff [26] and explain the existence of the highest-energy cosmic rays [27] It will\nbecome more important at higher energies, as we get closer to the a [−][1] wavelength scale Similar arguments apply to heavy nuclei, again invalidating the GZK cutoff Since, in both\ncases, the cosmic ray energy was expected to degrade over distances ≈ 10 [24] m according to\nconventional estimates, the correction by several orders of magnitude we just introduced\napplies to distance scales much larger than the estimated size of the presently observable\nUniverse It is not possible to extend the argument to photons of E ≈ 10 [14] eV, because\nin this case one would have (k a) [2] ≈ 10 [−][29] leading to too small corrections Thus, compared to the model considered by Coleman and Glashow [15], the present\nscenario (where K and a have an exactly universal value for all ”ordinary” particles)\nproduces the reverse effect Not only the existence of very high-energy cosmic rays is\nnot an evidence against Lorentz symmetry violation, but the experimental failure of the\nGZK cutoff for protons and nuclei would be an evidence for a deviation from relativistic\nkinematics Obvioulsy, a better understanding of the dynamics at Planck scale is needed 2b Unstable high-momentum particles live longer than naively expected\n\n\nIn standard relativity, we can compute the lifetime of any unstable particle in its\nrest frame and, with the help of a Lorentz transformation, obtain the Lorentz-contracted\nlifetime for a particle moving at finite speed This is no longer possible with the kinematics\ndefined by (10) If a particle of mass m and momentum k decays into two particles (particles\n1 and 2) with masses m 1 and m 2, m > m 1 + m 2, we can write at high energy, in the\nenergetically most favourable configuration (no transverse energy):\n\n\nE (k, m) = E (k [′], m 1 ) + E (k − k [′], m 2 ) (43)\n\n\n11\n\n\nwhich, with a simple change of variables using (10) can be turned into:\n\n\n[sin [2] (θ/2) + α] [1][/][2] = [sin [2] (θ 1 /2) + α 1 ] [1][/][2] + [sin [2] (θ 2 /2) + α 2 ] [1][/][2] (44)\n\n\nwhere θ = k a, α = (π m c a) [2] h [−][2] and similarly for θ 1, θ 2, α 1 and α 2 Writing\nfor simplicity α 1 = α 2 and setting the configuration θ 1 = θ 2, (always allowed with\nexact Lorentz invariance in which case it requires nonzero transverse energy), the equation\nbecomes:\nsin [2] (θ/2) + α = 4 [sin [2] (θ 1 /2) + α 1 ] (45)\n\n\nand, for θ 1 = θ 2 /2 :\n1 − cos (k a/2) = (α − 4 α 1 ) [1][/][2] (46)\n\n\nand, for α, α 1 and k a ≪ 1, can be approximated by:\n\n\nk ≃ 2 [1][/][2] (π c) [1][/][2] (a h) [−][1][/][2] (m [2] − 4 m [2] 1 [)] [1][/][4] (47)\n\n\nso that the configuration is forbidden above this value of k This implies an important\nreduction of phase space for the decay of very high-energy particles: their lifetimes get\nlonger than it was expected with exact Lorentz invariance",
    "This implies an important\nreduction of phase space for the decay of very high-energy particles: their lifetimes get\nlonger than it was expected with exact Lorentz invariance More complicate expressions\nwith similar meaning can be derived for m 1 ̸= m 2 If m 1 and m 2 are both nonzero, a\nstronger constraint can be obtained which forbids the decay at very high energy To derive\nit, we can write: θ = θ 1 + θ 2, and expand equation (44) We are thus led to:\n\n\nα − α 1 − α 2 = 2 [sin [2] (θ 1 /2) sin [2] (θ 2 /2) + D (θ 1, θ 2, α 1, α 2 )] (48)\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\nD (θ 1, θ 2, α 1, α 2 ) = [sin [2] (θ 1 /2) + α 1 ] [1][/][2] [sin [2] (θ 2 /2) + α 2 ] [1][/][2] −\n\n\n− sin (θ 1 /2) sin (θ 2 /2) cos (θ 1 /2) cos (θ 2 /2) (49)\n\n\nIf m 1 or m 2 vanishes, it will always be possible to keep the left-hand side of (48) larger\nthan the right-hand side taking, for instance, m 1 = 0 and sin (θ 1 /2) small enough\n(although most of the usual phase space would then be lost) However, this possibility\ndoes no longer exist if none of the two masses vanish In general, any decay with at least\ntwo massive particles being part of the final state is forbidden at very high energy We can\ncheck the existence of such bounds minimizing the right-hand side in (48) If m 2 is the\nsmallest mass, a typical bound will forbid the decay for E > E [st] where:\n\n\nE [st] ≈ c [3][/][2] h [1][/][2] (a m 2 ) [−][1][/][2] (m [2] − m [2] 1 [−] [m] [2] 2 [)] [1][/][2] (50)\n\n\nThus, as a result of Lorentz symmetry violation, unstable particles and nuclei may become\nstable when accelerated to very high momenta, provided all decay channels contain at least\ntwo massive particles The energy scale above which the decay is forbidden varies like the\ninverse square root of the mass of the lightest particle produced by the decay The neutron would become stable for E ∼  - 10 20 eV At the same energies or slightly\nabove, some unstable nuclei would also become stable Similarly, some hadronic resonances\n\n\n12\n\n\n(e g the ∆ [++], whose decay product must contain at least a proton and a positron) would\n         become stable at E ∼ 10 [21] eV Most of these objects will decay before they can be\naccelerated to such energies, but they may result of a collision at very high energy or of\nthe decay of a superluminal particle The study of very high-energy cosmic rays can thus\nreveal as stable particles objects which would be unstable if produced at accelerators Neutrino masses and oscillations are also important in order to discuss the lifetimes\nof high-energy particles, as we are often confronted to decay modes involving muon and\nelectron neutrinos For instance, if one of the light neutrinos (ν e, ν µ ) has a mass in the\n≈ 10 eV range, the muon would become stable at energies above ≈ 10 [22] eV Let E 1, E 2,\nm 1 and m 2 be the energies and masses of neutrinos ν 1 and ν 2, which mix to give neutrinos\nν and ν [′] with energies E, E [′] and masses m, m [′] We write (10) as: E = F (k, m)\nfor neutrino ν, and similar expressions for the other neutrinos A simple mixing scheme\nwould be to add to the hamiltonian non-diagonal elements:\n\n\n< ν 1 | H | ν 2         - = < ν 2 | H | ν 1         - = ∆(k) (51)\n\n\nand require that the hamiltonian has eigenvalues E and E [′] given by the above described\nexpressions We then get:\n\n\n∆ [2] (k) = F (k, m 1 ) F (k, m 2 ) − F (k, m) F (k, m [′] ) (52)\n\n\nand a mixing angle ψ given by:\n\n\ntan (2 ψ) = 2 ∆(k) [F (k, m 1 ) − F (k, m 2 )] [−][1] (53)\n\n\nGoing back to a more fundamental level, if φ 1 and φ 2 are two different (but related)\ndegrees of freedom satisfying equation (1) and describing ν 1 and ν 2 with the same value of\nK and different values of ω rest [2] [, adding a term proportional to][ |][ φ] [1] [−] [φ] [2] [|] [2] [ to the lagrangian]\nwould indeed result in a pure mass mixing of the type we just presented with constant ψ,\nwithout changing the effective value of K (therefore leaving the critical speed in vacuum\nunchanged) However, since Lorentz invariance does no longer hold, the form of the dispersion relation (10) may be modified at high wavelength by anharmonic effects Mixing with\nsuperluminal particles would produce different effects, as it necessarily implies particles\nassociated to oscillations with different values of K and cannot leave sectorial kinematics\nunchanged Such a mixing can strongly modify the parameters of our above discussion\n(see also [11] for an explicit example), but in any case it contributes to invalidate the GZK\ncutoff and to possibly permit unstable particles to become stable at high momentum",

    "By traveling\nat very high speed, such particles can emit pairs of ”back-to-back” ordinary photons and\nneutrinos (see, e g [9, 10]) or locally thermalize slower (therefore, heavier) superluminal\nparticles which in turn would thermalize ordinary matter In this way, it may be possible to\nsolve the horizon problem and simultaneously find dark matter candidates, if superluminal\nparticles are abundant enough to compensate the expected weak coupling between different\nsectors More precise considerations would require building a global cosmological model,\nof which we give some possible ingredients below To attempt a description of the cosmological role of superluminal particles, we assume\nthat a theory of all gravitation-like forces can be built, taking at each point the vacuum\nrest frame, and generalize Friedmann equations writing for a flat Universe in the present\nepoch (where pressure can be neglected):\n\n\nR [−][1] d [2] R/dt [2] ≈ − 4π Z 2 Z

ρ a the density of ”acoustic” ordinary\nmatter, ρ O the density of ”optical” ordinary matter (taken to be positive), ρ a,i and ρ O,i the\ndensities of ”acoustic” and ”optical” matter of the i-th superluminal sectors (again, taking\nthe densities of ”optical” particles to be positive), and the G’s are effective gravitation-like\ncoupling constants Z 2 Z 1 [−][1] replaces the usual expression G N ρ in standard Friedmann\nequations Z 1 is the total density of ”particle matter”, where the expression ”particle\nmatter” designs all possible excitations of vacuum that we can describe as particles Expressions (54) to (57) can be derived, for instance, by associating standard Friedmann\nequations (with only one ”gravitational” component) to a lagrangian in terms of R and\n\n\n14\n\n\ndR/dt, and generalizing the expressions for kinetic and potential energies in the limit\nwhere gravitational couplings between different components of Z 1 are small An interaction\nbetween the different ”gravitational” components of Z 1 is, even in this case, implicitly\ngenerated by the constraint that R and dR/dt are space-time variables common to all\nthe kinds of matter we consider Since, at the same time, cosmology considers space-time\nas being generated by matter, this is indeed an effective dynamical interaction between\nmatter from different sectors The role of vacuum is crucial in the generation of a single,\nabsolute space-time with a local absolute rest frame The new formulae reflect the fact that the ”graviton” coupled to superluminal matter\nis in principle not the same which couples to ”ordinary” matter (indeed, local fluctuations\nof the vacuum rest frame and dynamical constants can be sector-dependent), assume for\nsimplicity a similar separation between ”optical” and ”acoustic” matter inside the same\nsector and, to a first approximation, neglect effects due to the mixing between the effective\ngravitons coupled to different components Modifications to this schematic description can\nbe readily introduced, but would not change our basic reasoning and conclusions concerning\nthe new flexibility of cosmological fits and the allowed values of the cosmological constant For instance, we can add to Z 2 ”non-diagonal” terms due to gravitation-like interactions\nbetween different components of Z 1 Defining, as usual [17, 18], the critical density ρ c as\nthe ”acoustic” ordinary matter density which, alone, would make the standard Friedmann\nequations compatible with a flat Universe without cosmological constant and with the\nmeasured value of Hubble’s constant, i e ρ c = 3 (8π G N ) [−][1] H 0 [2] [where][ H] [0] [ is the current]\nvalue of R [−][1] dR/dt, we can write:\n\n\nΩ Λ = (8π G N ρ c ) [−][1] Λ = (3 H 0 [2] [)] [−][1] [ Λ] (58)\n\n\nΩ α = G α ρ [2] α [(][G] [N] [ρ] [c] [Z] [1] [)] [−][1] = (3 Z 1 H 0 [2] [)] [−][1] [ G] [α] [ρ] [2] α (59)\n\nwhere G α ρ [2] α [is one of the components of][ Z] [2] [ in (57), i e ][ α][ =][ a, O,][ (][a, i][)][,][ (][O, i][) ]\nWe then get, for a flat Universe, the relation:\n\n\nΩ= Ω Λ + Σ α Ω α = 1 (60)\n\n\nIn the recent years, there have been claims [28, 29] in favour of a comparatively\nlarge cosmological constant which could amount, using the above definitions of the Ωlike parameters, to values of Ω Λ (the contribution of the cosmological constant to the\nexpansion of the Universe) as large as ≈ 0 6 The scenario we propose, with many\ncomponents of Z 1 and Z 2, would allow for rather small values of Z 2 Z 1 [−][1] (typically, if\nthere are many components with similar weights and weakly interacting with eachother),\nand therefore possibly for Ω Λ naturally close to 1 in a flat Universe, even if ρ a /ρ c is equal\nto 0 3 or larger Thus, at the price of considerably weakening the connection between the\ndensity of ordinary ”acoustic” matter and the parameters governing the expansion of a\nflat Universe but possibly getting closer to reality, the new formulation would really make\neasier cosmological fits willing to simultaneously describe matter in the Universe, galaxy\nformation, the age of the Universe, and the spectrum and isotropy of cosmic microwave\nbackground If the Universe is not flat, the following term accounting for cosmic curvature\nshould be added to the right-hand side of (55):\n\n\nZ curv = − k c R U [−][2] Z 1 [−][1] Σ α ρ α c [2] α (61)\n\n\n15\n\n\nwhere k c = ± 1 is the curvature constant, R U the curvature radius of the Universe (most\nlikely, R U ≫ R) and c α the critical speed of each component of Z 1 From (54 - 57), the\nformula for the deceleration parameter q [17, 18] becomes:\n\n\nq = − (R d [2] R/dt [2] ) (dR/dt) [−][2] = H [−][2] (4π Z 2 Z 1 [−][1] − Λ)/3 (62)\n\n\nwhere H = R [−][1] dR/dt is Hubble’s ”constant” and, writing:\n\n\n− Z curv = − H [2] + (8π Z 2 Z 1 [−][1] + Λ)/3 = H [2] (2 q − 1) + Λ (63)\n\n\nwe generalize the well-known relation between curvature, deceleration and Hubble’s constant [17, 18] in the presence of a nonvanishing cosmological constant Defining Ωas\nbefore, expression (60) applied to the present Universe becomes now:\n\n\nΩ = Ω Λ + Σ α Ω α = 1 − Z curv H 0 [−][2] = 1 + k c R U [−][2] H 0 [−][2] Z 1 [−][1] Σ α ρ α c [2] α (64)\n\n\nor, eliminating Z curv in terms of the present value of q, q 0 :\n\n\nΩ particles = Σ α Ω α = 2 (q 0 + Ω Λ ) (65)\n\n\nwhich is similar to standard formulae, but with the definitions (58) and (59) Whether the\nUniverse is flat or curved, the equalities (64) and (65) lead to the standard relations:\n\n\nΩ Λ = (1 − 2q 0 − Z curv H 0 [−][2] [)][/][3] (66)\n\n\nΩ particles = 2 (1 + q 0 − Z curv H 0 [−][2] [)][/][3] (67)\n\n\nwith Z curv = 0 in a flat Universe The requirement that Ω particles be positive, combined\nwith experimental bounds on q 0, puts bounds on a positive value of Z curv (corresponding to\nk = − 1) The situation seems less obvious for negative values of Z curv, if superluminal\nparticles exist In recent fits [28, 29], Ω Λ tends to get close to its maximum value\ncompatible with experimental lower bounds on q 0, and a negative Z curv would allow for\na larger Ω Λ provided the contribution of superluminal sectors to Ω particles is large enough In (54) and (55), the cosmological constant Λ is actually:\n\n\nΛ = Z 1 [−][1] Σ α Λ α ρ α (68)\n\n\nwhere the Λ α are sectorial cosmological constants, varying much slower than R The\nexpansion of the Universe seems thus to generate the vacuum matter which produces the\nsectorial cosmological constants It is quite naturally that a significant cosmological constant would arise in our approach If Z 1 and Z 2 describe the role of vacuum excitations, but\nthe expansion of the Universe is still generating the matter which forms the ground state\nof vacuum (i e ”vacuum” itself), this evolution is expected to spend a sizeable amount of\nenergy in the creation of new matter: it must be driven by vacuum dynamics and vacuum\nenergy Then, the presence in (54) and (55) of terms describing inner vacuum dynamics seems compelling, even at a deeper level than for inflationary models For instance,\nvacuum may have two sets of degrees of freedom: a) one, presently at low temperature,\nwhich produces all the objects that we call ”particles”; b) a second one at higher temperature (possibly undergoing a second-order phase transition and weakly coupled to the\n\n\n16\n\n\nparticles we observe), whose cooling generates vacuum matter and drives vacuum expansion It is well kown, in condensed matter physics, that two weakly interacting sets of\ndegrees of
