    "g , because it is not possible to conduct releable measures, say, of length, with a stationary meter varying in time) and other problematic aspects [3][t]\nMore generally, the noncanonical character of Riemannian theories of gravitation implies\nthat the still unresolved problematic aspects debated during this century on gravitation, quite\nlikely, are not due to Einstein’s field equations, but rather to the lack of proper mathematics\nused in their treatment, which is the viewpoint adopted in this note At the operator level it is easy to see that, for consistency with the classical counterpart,\nquantum gravity must have a nonunitary time evolution when referred to a conventional\nHilbert space over a conventional field It is now established [3][t] that theories with nonunitary\ntime evolutions are afflicted by the following shortcomings: 1) They do not have invariant\nunits of space and time, by therefore lacking physically un-ambiguous applications to experimental measurements; 2) they do not preserve Hermiticity in time, thus lacking physically\nacceptable observabnles; and 3) they do not have unique and invariant numerical predictions\n(because of the lack of uniqueness and invariance of the special functions needed for data\nelaboration) In an attempt to resolve the above problematic aspects in due time, in this note we submit\na novel formulation of gravity based on the following central assumptions: 1) Preservation\nunchanged of Einstein’s field equations and related experimental verifications; 2) classical\nformulation of these equations under the uncompromisable conditions of possessing invariant\nunits of space and time, as it is the case for the special relativity; and 3) operator formulation\nof gravity based on the axioms of conventional relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "In an attempt to resolve the above problematic aspects in due time, in this note we submit\na novel formulation of gravity based on the following central assumptions: 1) Preservation\nunchanged of Einstein’s field equations and related experimental verifications; 2) classical\nformulation of these equations under the uncompromisable conditions of possessing invariant\nunits of space and time, as it is the case for the special relativity; and 3) operator formulation\nof gravity based on the axioms of conventional relativistic quantum mechanics 2 Isominkowskian geometry A study of the above conditions is permitted by a\nnovel form of mathematics called isomathematics originally proposed by Santilli [3][a] and then\nstudies in various works [3][−][5] It is characterized by liftings of conventional mathematics called\nisotopies which map any linear local and canonical structure into its most general possible\nnonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical form, which is nevertheless capable of reconstructing\nlinearity, locality and canonicity on certain generalized spaces and fields called isospaces and isofields\nThe isotopies are ideally suited to study assumptions 1), 2) and 3) of Sect 1 because\n\n\n2\n\n\nthey are axiom-preserving by conception and construction, while the new formulations are\nlocally isomorphic to the original ones This evidently ensures the preservation unchanged\nof Einstein’s axiom ab initio Jointly, the isotopies do permit the achievement of a theory\nwith a basic invariant unit, as we shall see The fundamental isotopy for relativistic theories is the lifting of the unit of conventional\ntheories, the unit I = diag (1, 1, 1, 1) of the Minkowski space and of the Poincare’ symmetry,\ninto a well behaved, nowhere singular, Hermitean and positive–definite 4 × 4-dimensional\nmatrix I [ˆ] whose elements have an arbitrary dependence on local quantities and, therefore,\ncan depend on the space–time coordinates x and other needed variables, I → I [ˆ] = I [ˆ] (x) > 0,\nwhile the conventional associative product A × B among generic quantities A, B is lifted by\nthe inverse amount, A × B → A× [ˆ] B = A × T [ˆ] × B, I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1] ˆ Under these assumptions ˆ ˆ I [ˆ] is the (left and right) generalized unit of the new theory,\nI ˆ×A = A×I ≡ A, ∀A, called the isounit and ˆT is called the isotopic element For consistency,\nthe totality of the original theory must then be reconstructed to admit I [ˆ] as the correct (left\nand right) unit This implies the isotopies of numbers, angles, fields, spaces, differential\ncalculus, functional analysis, geometries, algebras, symmetries, etc [3][r] (see ref [3][f] for a recent\naccount) Let M(x, η, R) be the Minkowski space with space–time coordinates x = {x [µ] } = {r, x [4] },\nx [4] = c 0 t (where c 0 is the speed of light in vacuum), and metric η = Diag (1, 1, 1, −1) over\nthe reals R = R(n, +, ×) Let ℜ(x, g(x), R) be a (3+1)–dimensional Riemannian space with\nnowhere singular and symmetric metric g = g [t] = U × η × U [t]",

    "g , because the notion of primes and other properties of number theory depend on the\nassumed unit For further aspects we refer to [5][r] which also includes the isotopies of angles\nand functions analysis Note for later needs the identity, ˆn× [ˆ] A ≡ n × A Next, we need the lifting of the space M into the isominkowskian space M [ˆ] = M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] )\n\nˆ\nfirst proposed by Santilli in Ref [3][h] which is characterized by the isocoordinates x → x =\n\nˆ\nU × x × U [t] = x × I [ˆ], and isometric η → η(x) = U × η × U [t] ≡ g(x) although, for consistency,\nthe latter must be defined on R [ˆ], thus having the structure N [ˆ] = ( N [ˆ] µν ) = ˆη × I [ˆ] = (ˆη µν ) × I [ˆ] The conventional interval on M is then lifted into the isointerval on M [ˆ] over R [ˆ] [4][h]\n\n\n(ˆx − yˆ) ˆ2 = (ˆx − yˆ) µ ˆ×N ˆ µν ˆ×(ˆx − yˆ) ν = [(x − y) µ × ˆη µν × (x − y) ν ] × ˆI =\n\n\n= [(x [1] − y [1] ) × T [ˆ] 11 × (x [1] − y [1] ) + (x [2] − y [2] ) × T 22 × (x [2] − y [2] ) +\n\n\n+(x [3] − y [3] ) × T 33 × (x [3] − y [3] ) − (x [4] − y [4] ) × T 44 × (x [4] − y [4] ) × I [ˆ] (2)\n\n\nAs one can see, the above interval coincides with the conventional Riemannian interval\nbyu conception, except for the factor I [ˆ] ˆ\nIt easy to see that M [ˆ] is locally isomorphic toˆ M and the lifting M → M is also an\nisotopy In particular, the isospace M is isoflat, i e",
    "e , it verifies the axiom of flatness in\nisospace over the isofields, that is, when referred to the generalized unit I [ˆ], otherwise M [ˆ] is\nevidently curved owing to the dependence ˆη = ˆη(x) = g(x) In other words, assumptions\n(1) eliminate the curvature while preserving the Riemannian metric As we shall see, this\nappears to be essential to achieve a gravitational theory with an invariant basic unit Note\nthat M [ˆ] and R [ˆ] have the same isounit I [ˆ] Studies of isocontinuty properties on isospaces have\nbeen conducted by Kadeisvili [4][r] and those of the underlying novel isotopology by Tsagas and\nSourlas [4][s] The isominkowskian geometry [3][r] is the geometry of isospaces M [ˆ], and incorporates in a\nsymbiotic way both the Minkowskian and Riemannian geometries In fact, it preserves all\ngeometric properties of the conventional Minkowskian geometry, including the light cone and\nthe maximal causal speed c o (see below), while jointly incorporating the machinery of the\nRiemannian geometry in an isotopic form As such, it is ideally suited for our objectives It should be indicated that this author has studied until the interior gravitational problem\nvia the isotopies of the Riemannian geometry The use of the isominkowskian geometry for\n\n\n4\n\n\nthe characterization of the exterior gravitational problem was brifly indicated in note [3][o] and it\nis studied in more details in this work Also, the main line of the isominkowskian geometry\ninclusive of the machinery of the Riemannian geometry are presented in this study for the\nfirst time To outline the new geometry, one must know that, unexpectedly, the use of the ordinary\ndifferential calculus leads to inconsistencies under isotopies (e",

symmetry of gravitation An important property\n\n\n7\n\n\nof the isominkowskian formulation of gravity, which is lacking for conventional formulations, is that of admitting a universal, classical and operator symmetry for all possible\nRiemannian formulations of gravitation first identified by Santilli [3][h][−−][3][l] under the name of\nisopoincar´e symmetry P [ˆ] (3 1), which results to be locally isomorphic to the conventional symmetry P (3 1) [3][h][−][3][l] The isosymmetry can be easly constructed via the isotopies of Lie’s theory [3][a,][3][d] called Lie–\nSantilli isoteory [5] which essentially consists in the reconstruction of all branches of Lie’s theory\n(universal enveloping algebras, Lie algebras, Lie group, transformation and representation\ntheories, etc ) for the generalized unit I [ˆ] = [ T [ˆ] (x)] [−][1] Since I > [ˆ] 0, one can see from the\ninception that the isopoincar´e symmetry is isomorphic to the conventional one, P [ˆ] (3 1) ≈\nP (3 1) (see ref [4][t] for a recent accounts) The operator version of the isopoincar´e symmetry is characterized by the conventional\ngenerators and parameter opnly lifted into isospaces over isofields X = {X k } = {M µν =\nx µ p ν − x ν p, p α } → X [ˆ] = {M [ˆ] µν = ˆx µ × ˆp ν − xˆ ν × ˆp µ, ˆp α }, k = 1, 2, , 10, µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4,\nand w = {w k } = {(θ, v), a} ∈ R → wˆ = w × I [ˆ] ∈ R [ˆ] (ˆn, +, × [ˆ] ) The isotopies preserve\nthe original connectivity propertiesˆ [3][r] The connected component of P (3 1) is then given by\nP 0 (3 1) = S ˆO(3 1)ˆ×T ˆ(3 1), where S ˆO(3 1) is the connected isolorentz group [3][h] and ˆT (3 1)\nis the group of isotranslations [3][k] P [ˆ] 0 (3 1) can be written via the isoexponentiation as ˆe [A] =\n\nˆ ˆ\nI + A/1 + A×A/2 + = (e [A][×][ ˆ][T] ) × ˆI characterized by the isotopic Poincar´e–Birkhoff–Witt\ntheorem [3][a,][3][d,][5] of the underlying isoenveloping associative algebra\n\n\nPˆ 0 (3 1) : ˆA( ˆw) = Π k eˆ [i][×][X][×][w] = (Π k e [i][×][X][×][ ˆ][T]

its nonlinear character,\nas evidently necessary for any symmetry of gravitation What is intriguing is that the\nisopoincar´e symmetry recovers linearity on M [ˆ] over R [ˆ], a property called isolinearity [3][t] Conventional linear transforms on M violate isolinearity on M [ˆ] and must then be replaced\nwith the isotransforms ˆx [′] = A [ˆ] ( ˆw)× [ˆ] X [ˆ] = A [ˆ] ( ˆw) × T [ˆ] (x) × ˆx which can be written from (5) for\ncomputational purposes (only) ˆx [′] = A [˜] (w) × ˆx The preservation of the original dimension\nis ensured by the isotopic Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff Theorem [3][a,][3][d,][5] Structure (5) then\nforms a connected Lie–Santilli isogroup [5] with laws A [ˆ] ( ˆw)× [ˆ] A [ˆ] ( ˆw [′] ) = A [ˆ] ( ˆw [′] )× [ˆ] A [ˆ] ( ˆw) = A [ˆ] ( ˆw +\n\nˆ ˆ\nw [′] ), A [ˆ] ( ˆw)× [ˆ] A [ˆ] (−w) = A [ˆ] (0) = I [ˆ] (x) = [T (x)] [−][1] As one can see, P [ˆ] 0 (3 1) is noncanonical on M over R (e g , because it does not preserve\nthe conventional unit I), but it is canonical on M [ˆ] over R [ˆ], a property called isocanonicity\n(because it leaves invariant by construction the isounit) This confirms the achievement,\napparently for the first time, of an operator theory of gravity verifying the fundamental\n\n\n8\n\n\ninvariance of its unit The invariance at the classical level is consequential The isodiscrete transforms [3][i] are given by ˆπ× [ˆ] x = π×x = (−r, x [4] ), ˆτ × [ˆ] x = τ ×x = (r, −x [4] ),\nwhere ˆπ = π × I, [ˆ] ˆτ = τ × I [ˆ], and π, τ are the conventional inversion operators Despite such a\nsimplicity, the physical implications are nontrivial because of the possibility of reconstructing\nas exact discrete symmetries when believed to be broken, which is studied by embedding all\nsymmetry breaking terms in the isounit [3][s] One should be aware that this is a rather general\nproperty of the Lie–Santilli isotheory, thus holding also for continuous symmetries In fact,\ncontrary to a popular beliefs, this note shows that the Lorentz and Poincar´e symmetries are\nexact for gravitation The use isodifferential calculus on M [ˆ] then yields the Lie–Santilli isoalgebra ˆp 0 (3 1) [3][k]\n\n\n[ M [ˆ] µν,ˆM [ˆ] αβ ] = i × (ˆη να

[ˆ] (x) × B − B × T [ˆ] (x) × A is the isoproduct (originally proposed\nin [3][b] ), which does indeed satisfy the Lie axioms in isospace, as one can verify Note the\nappearance of the Riemannian metric ˆη µν = g µν (x), this time, as the ”structure functions”\nηˆ µν of the isoalgebra [3][a,][3][d,][5] Note also that the momentum components isocommute (while\nthey are notoriously non–commutative for QG) This confirms the achievement of an isoflat\nrepresentation of gravity The local isomorphism ˆp 0 (3 1) ≈ p 0 (3 1) is ensured by the positive–definiteness of T [ˆ] In\nfact, the use of the generators in the form M [ˆ] ν [µ] [= ˆ][x] [µ] [ ˆ][×][p] [ν] [ −][x][ˆ] [ν] [ ˆ][×][p][ˆ] [µ] [ would yield the][ conventional]\nstructure constants under a generalized Lie product,

inverse\namount 1 µ → T [ˆ] µµ [−][1] [ ]\nIn particular, the isolight cone also has the conventionals characteristic angle, as a necessary condition for an isotopy (the proof of the latter property requires the use of isotrigonometric and isohyperbolic functions) Thus, the maximal causal speed in isominkowski space\nis the conventional speed c 0 The identity of the light cone and isocones is the geometric\norigin of the isomorphism SO [ˆ] (3 1) ≈ SO(3 1) and, thus, of the exact validity of the Lorentz\nsymmetry for all possible Riemannian metrics g(x) The isotranslations can be written x [′] = (ˆe [i][×][p][ˆ][×][a] )× [ˆ] xˆ = [x+a×A(x)]×I, [ˆ] ˆp [′] = (ˆe [i][×][p][ˆ][×][a] )× [ˆ] pˆ =\npˆ, where A µ = T [ˆ] µµ [1][/][2] [+][ a] [α] [ ×][ [ ˆ][T] µµ [ 1][/][2] [,][ˆˆ][p] [α] []][/][1 +][ ][ and they are also nonlinear, as expected ]\nIntriguingly, the isotopies identify one additional symmetry which is absent in the conventional case It is here called isoselfscalar invariance and it is given by the rescaling of\nthe unit I [ˆ] → I [ˆ] [′] = n [2] × I [ˆ], where n is an 11-th parameter, under which the interval remains\ninvariant, ˆx [ˆ2] = (x [µ] × T [ˆ] µ [α] [×] [η] [αν] [×]

corresponding isosymmetry is not trivial, e g , because n [2]\n\nenters into the argument of the isolorentz transforms (9) The same symmetry also holds for the isoinner product (whenever n does not depend\non the integration variable), < Φ [ˆ] | × T [ˆ] × |Ψ [ˆ] - ×I [ˆ] ≡< Φ [ˆ] | × (n [−][2] × T [ˆ] ) × |Ψ [ˆ] - ×(n [2] × I) Note finally that the latter symmetries have remained undetected throughout this century\nbecause they required the prior discovery of new numbers, those with an arbitrary unit [3][g] 6",
    "6 Inclusion of interior gravitation The attentive reader may have noted that the\nisotopies leave unrestricted the functional dependence of the isometric Its sole dependence\non the coordinates is therefore a restriction which has been used so far for a representation\nof exterior gravitation in vacuum ˆ In the general case we have isometrics with an unrestricted functional dependence, ˆη =\nT (x, x, ∂Ψ, ) ×η, ˆT > 0, which, as such, can represent interior gravitation problems with an\nunrestricted nonlinearity in the velocities, wave functions and their derivatives, as expected\nin realistic interior models, e g , of neutron stars, quasars, black holes and all that Note also that the isometric can also contain nonlocal–integral terms, e g , representing\nwave–overlappings [3][s] Nevertheless, the theory verifies the condition of locality in isospace,\n\n\n11\n\n\ncalled isolocality, because its topology is everywhere local except at the unit [3][t,][4][r] The general isopoincar´e symmetry is here defined as the 11–dimensional set of isorotations, isoboosts, isotranslations, isoinversions and isoselfscalar transforms The restricted\nisopoincar´e transforms are those in which the isounit is averaged into constants The results\nof this note therefore imply the following:\n\n\nTheorem 1 The 11-dimensional, general isopoincar´e symmetry on isominkowski spaces\nover real isofields for well behaved and nowhere null isounits constitutes the largest possible\nisolinear, isolocal and isocanonical invariance of isoseparation (2) for nonsingular isometrics\nwith positive-definite isounits, thus constituting the universal invariance of exterior and\ninterior gravitations The verification of the invariant under the isopoincar´e transforms of all possible separation (2) is instructive The maximal character of the isosymmetry can be proved as in the\nconventional case Note that for any arbitrarily given (diagonal) Riemannian metric g(x)\n(such as Schwarzschild, Krasner, etc,) there is nothing to compute because one merely plots\nthe T [ˆ] µµ terms in the decomposition g µµ = T [ˆ] µµ × η µµ (no sum) in the above given isotransforms The invariance of the separation x [t] × g × x is then ensured The (2 + 2)–de Sitter or\nother cases can be derived from the theorem via mere changes of signature or dimension of\nthe isounit 7 Concluding remarks In summary, in this note we have presented, apparently for\nthe first time, a geometric unification of the special and general relativities in both classical\nand operator mechanics, as well as for both exterior and interior problems The results\nare centralluy dependent on the use of isominkowskian geometry as introduced in this note,\nrather than the use of the isoriemannian form as studied in Ref [3][s] The classical and operator geometric unification of the special and general relativities for\nthe exterior problem in vacuum is centrally depoendent on the achievement of a universal\nsymmetry for gravitation which, by conception and construction, is locally isomorphic to the\nPoincar´e symmetr of the special relativity This eliminates the historical difference between\nthe special and general relativities whereby the former admits a universal synnetry, while the\nlatter does not [1][,][2] Note the necessity of the representation of gravity in isominkovski space\nfor the very formulation of its universal isopoincar´e symmetry In fact, no isosymmetry can\nbe constructed in the Riemannian space, to our best knowledge",
    "In fact, no isosymmetry can\nbe constructed in the Riemannian space, to our best knowledge The above occurrence has a number of implications First, it allow to illustrate the\nviewpoint expressed in Sect 1 to the effect that some of controversies in gravitation debated\nover this century are not due to Einstein’s field equations, but rather to insufficiencies in the\nmathematics used for their treatment 12\n\n\nA typical case is the controversy whether the total conservation laws of general relativity\nare compatible with those of the special relativity Our representation of Einstein’s equations\nvia the novel isomathematics permits a resolution of this old controversy via a mere visual\n\nexamination Recall that the generators of all space-time symmetries characterize total conserved quantities The compatiobility of the total conservation laws of the general and special relativities\nis therefore established by the visual observation that the generators of the Poincare’ and\nisopoincare’ symmetries coincide In fact, only the mathematical operations on them are\nchanged in the transition from the relativistic to the gravitational case The isominkowskian treatment of gravity also permits a resolution of some of the limitations of conventional gravitational models, such as their insufficiency to provide an effective\nrepresentation of interior gravitational problems In fact, conventional formulations of gravity admit only a limited dependence on the velocities, while being strictly local-differential\nand derivable from a first-order Lagrangians (variationally self-adjoint [3][d] ), characteristics\nwhich are evidently exact for exterior propblems in vacuum By comparison, interior gravitational problems, such as all forms of gravitational collapse,\nare constitutred by extended and hyperdense hadrons in conditions of total mutual penetration in large numbers into small regions of space It is well known that these conditions\nimply effects which are arbitrarily nonlinear in the velocities as well as in the wavefunctions,\nnonlocal-integral on various quantities and variationally nonselfadjoint [3][d,][3][e], (i e not representable via first-order Lagrangians) It is evident that the latter conditions are beyond any\nscientific expectation of quantitative treatment via conventional gravitational theories The isominkowskian formulation of gravity resolve this limitation too and shows that it is\nequally due to insufficiencies in the underlying mathematics In fact, isogravitation extends\nthe applicability of Einstein’s axioms to a form which is ”direcly universal for exterior and\ninterior gravitations”, namely, capable of representing all exterior and interior conditions\nconsidered (universality), directly in the x-frame of the experimenter (direct universality),\nthus extending the above unification to interior conditions As indicated earlier, this extension is due to the fact that the funcional dependence\nof the metric in Riemannian treatments is restricted to the sole dependence on the local\ncoordinates, g = g(x), while under isotopies the same dependence becomes unrestricted,\ng = g(x, v, φ, ∂ψ ) without altering the original geometric axioms This results in geometric\nunification of exterior and interior problems, despite their sizable structural differences of\ntopological, analytic and other characters The latter unification was studied in details in\nref [3][s] under trhe isoriemannian geometry and it is studied with the isominkowskian geometry\nin this note for the reasons indicated earlier A first illustration of the extension of the axioms to realistic interior conditions is offered\nby the isoselfscalar transforms T [ˆ] µµ → n [−][2] × T [ˆ] µµ which permit the representation of electromagnetic waves propagating within physical media with local varying speed c = c 0 /n This\n\n\n13\n\n\nallows the construction, apparently for the first time, of Schwarzschild’s and other gravitational models for the interior of atmospheres and chromospheres with a locally varying\nvelocity of light Applications to specific cases, such as gravitational horizons, is then expected to permit refinements of current studies evidently due to deviations from the valud in\nvacuum of the speed of light in the hyperdense chromospheres outside gravitational horizons Except for being well behaved (and non–null), the parameter n remains unrestricted by\nthe isotopies and, therefore, n = 1 in vacuum but otherwise it can be n > 1 or < 1 As a\nresult, the isopoincar´e symmetry is a natural invariance for arbitrary causal speeds, whether\nequal, smaller or bigger than the speed of light The former were known since Lorentz’s [7][a] times\n(see the related quotation by Pauli’ [7][b] ) The latter have been predicted since some time in\ninterior problems only, but experimentally detected only recently, e g , for the speed of photons traveling in certain guides [8][a,][8][b] or for the speed of matter in astrophysical explosions [8][c][−][8][e]",
    ", for the speed of photons traveling in certain guides [8][a,][8][b] or for the speed of matter in astrophysical explosions [8][c][−][8][e] The recent Ref [8][f] has identified solutions of conventional relativistic equations with arbitrary\nspeeds in vacuum of which P [ˆ] (3 1) is evidently the natural invariance) Despite the local variation of c, the maximal causal speed on M [ˆ] over R [ˆ] remain c 0 again,\nbecause the change c → c 0 /n is compensated by an inverse change of the unit By recalling\nthat the STR is evidently inapplicable (and not ”violated”) for arbitrary causal speeds,\nwe can therefore say that the isotopies render the STR universally applicable, not only for\nclassical and operator gravitation, but also for arbitrary causal speeds Also the light isocone remains applicable for interior gravitational cases with arbitrary c As such, the light isocone appears to be more appropriate than the conventional light cone\nfor calculations, e As such, the light isocone appears to be more appropriate than the conventional light cone\nfor calculations, e g , outside gravitational horizons which, being composed of hyperdense\nchromospheres, do not admit the conventional speed of light in vacuum c 0 , outside gravitational horizons which, being composed of hyperdense\nchromospheres, do not admit the conventional speed of light in vacuum c 0 The indication of a number of developments currently under study appears recommendable The indication of a number of developments currently under study appears recommendable First, we note that the the zeros of the space (time) component of the isounit represent\ngravitation horizons (singularities) [3][s] This representation is trivially equivalent to the conventional one for the exterior case in vacuum However, gravitational collapse is a typical\ninterior case for which the isotopic representation becomes nontrivial, e g",
    "g , because it permits\nthe inclusion of the nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical effects indicated earlier Note that the zeros of the isounit have been excluded from Theorem 1 because of their\n\nyet unknown topological structure Another aspect which is under study is the iso–grand–unification [3][s], i e , the inclusion of\ngravitation in the unified gauge theories of electroweak interactions via its embedding in the\nunit of the theory If successful, these studies would extend the unification of this note to\nelectroweak interactions It should be also indicated that the isotopies with basic lifting I → I [ˆ] (x, Ψ, ) = I [ˆ] [†]\nconstitute only the first step of a chain of generalized methods [3][f] The second class is given by\nthe genotopies [3][a] in which the isounit is no longer Hermitean This broader class geometries\nin a natural way the interior irreversibility and it has been used, e g , for the black hole\n\n\n14\n\n\nmodel of ref [4][d] The third class of methods is given by the (multi–valued) hyperstructures, in\nwhich the generalized unit is constituted by a set of non–Hermitean quantities The latter\nmost general known class appears to be particularly significant for quantitative studies of\nbiological structures in which the conventional RQM is manifestly inapplicable due to its\nreversibility Also, the isotopies, genotopies and hyperstructures admit antiautomorphic images, called\nisodualities, and charactrized by the map I [ˆ] →−I [ˆ] [d] = −I [ˆ] [†] which are currently under study\nfor antimatter [3][q] In this case the energy–momentum tensor of antimatter becomes negative–\ndefinite, thus removing a problem of compatibility between the current representations of\nantimatter in classical and particle physics The gravitational treatment of antimatter via\nthe isodualities of the isominkowskian geometry will be studied elsewhere On historical grounds, we note that, as studied in detail in memoir [3][t] for the general\ncase of RHM, our OIG can be interpreted as a nonunitary completion of RQM considerably\nalong the historical E − P − R argument [9][a] for which yon Neumann theorem [9][b] and Bell’s\ninequalities [9][c] do not apply evidently because of its nonunitary structure Moreover, from the abstract identity of the right modular associative action H × |Ψ >\nand its isotopic image H [ˆ] ×| [ˆ] Ψ [ˆ] >, one can see that the isoeigenvalue equation H [ˆ] ×| [ˆ] Ψ [ˆ] >=\nE T ˆ ×|Ψ [ˆ] - characterizes an explicit and concrete operator realization of the ”hidden variable”\nλ = λ(x, ) ≡ T [ˆ]",
    ") ≡ T [ˆ] Our isotopic formulation of gravity can therefore be interpreted as a\nrealization of the theory of hidden variables After all, the ”hidden” character of gravitation\nin our theory is illustrated by the recovering of the conventional unit under the isoexpectation\nvalue < [ˆ] I [ˆ] - [ˆ] = I In conclusion, the viewpoint we have attempted to convey in this note is that an axiomatically consistent operator formulation of gravity always existed It did creep in un–noticed\nuntil now because embedded where nobody looked for, in the unit of RQM Acknowledgments The autor would like to thank for invaluable comments the participants to: the 7 Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity held at Stanford university in July 1994; the International Workshops held at the Istituto per la Ricerca di Base in\nMolise, Italy, on August 1995 and May 1996; and the International Workshop on Physical\nInterpretation of Relativity Theories held at the Imperial College, London, on September\n1996 Moreover, the author would like to express his sincere appreciation to the Editors of\nRendiconti Circolo Matematico Palermo, Foundations of Physics and Mathematical Methods\nin Applied Sciences, for invaluable, penetrating and constructive critical comments in the\neditorial processing of memoirs in the field, without which this paper could not have seen\nthe light 15\n\n\n## References\n\n\n[1] H A Lorentz, Amst Proc Proc 6, 809 (1904) [1a]; H Poincar´e, Compte Rendues, Paris 140 1504 (1905) [1b]; A Einstein, Ann Phys 17, 891 (1905) [1c]; H Minkowski, Nachr Ges Wiss Gottingen 43 (1908) [1d];\n\n\n[2] B Riemann, Gott Nachr 13, 133 (1868) and Collected Works, H Weber, Editor,\nDover, New York (1953) [2a]; D Hilbert, Nachr Kgl Ges Wissench Gottingen, 1915,\np 395 [2b]; A Einstein, Sitz Ber Preuss Akad Wissench Berlin, 1915, p 844 [2c];\nK",
