    "The words ”far enough” used in a) express this approximation ### 3 Linear transformations\n\n\nIf the transformations between these inertial systems are taken to be linear,\nthen the condition that any inertial motion is such for any local inertial sys\n\n2\n\n\ntem is implicity satisfied Many authors have added, to this hypothesis of\nlinearity, other hypotheses with the purpose of assuring consistency between\nthe measures of different observers; many of them [(8][−][23)] have not postulated,\na priori, the invariance of the light speed They conclude that these transformations must be of Lorentz-type, characterized by a velocity c which,\nin principle, may take different absolute value in the different astronomical\ndirections, but which is, for any fixed astronomical direction, equal for all\nthe local inertial systems The consequences of the existence of a preferred reference frame Σ have\nbeen extensively discussed by Mansouri and Sexl [(2)] ; in particular they analyze the form the linear transformation from Σ to an other frame S must\ntake in order that the classical special relativity experiments could be explained, without introducing a priori the invariance of the speed of light Moreover they compare the Einstein and the transport syncronization procedure and derive the dependence of the one-way velocity of light on its\nmotion direction One of the most general transformations between the inertial systems\nΣ and S, which relatively move along the x-direction which connects the\norigins Ωand O, has been given by Robertson [(4)] in the form:\n\n\n\nt [′] = a 0\n\n\n\nt + [va] [1], x [′] = a 1\n� a 0 c [2] [ x] �\n\n\n\n\n[va] [1], x [′] = a 1\n\na 0 c [2] [ x] �\n\n\n\nx + [va] [0] t, y [′] = a 2 y, z [′] = a 2 z, (1)\n� a 1 �\n\n\n\nwhere a 0, a 1 and a 2 may depend on v This transformation, which is expressed in terms of the parameter v and which reduces to the identity when\nv = 0, is derived under the hypotheses that: i) space is euclidean for both Σ\nand S which use identical rods and clocks; ii) in Σ all clocks are syncronized\nand light moves with a speed c which is independent of direction and position; iii) the one-way speed of light in S in the azymuth plane is direction\nindependent Notice that the relative velocity of S with respect to Σ is not given by\nv, but is equal to ˜v ≡ va 0 /a 1 ; analogously, the one-way velocity of light is\ngiven by ˜c ≡ ca 0 /a 1 In terms of these true velocities, equations (1) take\nthe form\n\n\n\nt [′] = a 0\n\n\n\nt + ˜ [v][˜], x [′] = a 1 (x + ˜vt), y [′] = a 2 y, z [′] = a 2 z (2)\n� c [2] [ x] �\n\n\n\nThe inverse transformation in the x-direction is given by\n\n\n\n1\n\nx =\n\n\n\na 1 (˜v)(1 − [v][˜] ˜ [2][2]\n\n\n\n\n[v]\n\nc˜ [2] [ )]\n\n\n\n˜\nx [′] − v [a] [1] [(˜][v][)] (3)\n� a 0 (˜v) [t] [′] �\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nMoreover, the velocity ˜c is seen by S to take the value\n\n\n˜\nc [′] = [a] [1] [(][v][)] (4)\n\na 0 (v) [c ][˜]\n\n\nIn other words, the one-way velocity of light scales as the relative velocity of\nthe two frames As a consequence, if S and S [′] are any two reference frames\nwhich are moving (along the x-axis) with respect to Σ, they appreciate\ndifferent relative velocities and different same-way velocities of light which\nare in the same ratio It follows that, if the unit lenght of S is such a way\nthat O and Ωappreciate the same relative speed, then a 0 = a 1 and viceversa It is interesting to notice that, if the Robertson hypotheses are released\nand one looks for the general one-dimensional linear transformations along\nthe x-axis between the preferred frame Σ and any S which satisfies the\ncondition that\n\n-not only Σ and S appreciate the same relative speed but also any two\nframes S and S [′], uniformly moving at finite velocities with respect to Σ,\nappreciate the same finite speed,\n-then one fundamental velocity (which obviously must be identified with\nthe light speed) exists, the syncronization between two points of a frame is\nin agreement with the Einstein rule and the transformations take the form\nof the first two of eqs (2) with a 0 = a 1 (see references (6)-(20) and, in\nparticular, (21)) The transformation (2) is simply the product of the scale transformation\nwhich scales the four dimensions respectively by the factors\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n1 − [v][˜] [2]\n\n\n\n˜ a 2 (˜v), a 2 (˜v) (5)\nc [2] [,]\n\n\n\na 0 (˜v)\n\n\n\n1 − [v][˜] [2]\n\n\n\n˜ a 1 (˜v)\nc [2] [,]\n\n\n\nby a standard Lorentz transformation The scale transformations, first considered by Galilei in Discorsi sovra\ndue nuove Scienze, were carefully analyzed by J Fourier, H von Helmoltz\nand in particular by H Poincar´e, who reached the conclusion that a pure\nspatial deformation of the universe has no physical consequences; moreover,\nif the space and time coordinates of the universe are deformed in such manner that all the space-time coincidences are conserved, then the universe\nremains unchanged",
    "Poincar´e, who reached the conclusion that a pure\nspatial deformation of the universe has no physical consequences; moreover,\nif the space and time coordinates of the universe are deformed in such manner that all the space-time coincidences are conserved, then the universe\nremains unchanged [(24)]\n\nIf we consider the particular case of eqs (2) in which ˜v = 0, we have\n\n\nds [2] = dx [′][2] + dy [′][2] + dz [′][2] = a [2] 1 [dx] [2] [ +][ a] [2] 2 [dy] [2] [ +][ a] [2] 2 [dz] [2] [ ] (6)\n\n\n4\n\n\nThis case is typical of a tetragonal crystal; the position of the second nearest neighborhood is described in S by the numbers (1, 1, 0) and in S [′] by the\ncomponents (a 1, a 2, 0) The distances remain the same It is worthwhile to\nnotice that, in this case, if we scale the units of S [′] in such a way that they\nbecome equal, the times required by the light to travel the reticular distances in the different directions remain unchanged, but the light velocities\nare corresponding scaled; the anisotropy of the tetragonal crystal remains\nuntouched ### 4 Conclusions\n\n\nThe general transformation (2) reduces to the Lorentz one if one requires\nthat Ωand O evaluate that the clock of the other observer is going slower\nin the same ratio (or, equivalently, if each of them appreciate an identical\ncontraction for the reciprocal rods) The effect of the scale transformations (5) must be carefully analyzed For what concerns the lenghts in different directions, if there is no way for\nindependent measures of lenghts and light velocities, in other words, if unit\nlenghts are measured by fixing the light velocity (or viceversa), there is no\nway of controlling the change in lenght of a rod with the orientation The\nonly thing to do is to use the Poincar´e simplicity criterion and consider\nequal the lenghts of the rods and the one-way speeds of light in the different\ndirections In conclusion, isotropy in the one-way speed of light is a matter of definition and the experiments conducted by J Hall and coworkers at very\nsofisticated levels must be considered significant improvements of some classical experiments in the frame of the special relativity There are however experiments which cannot be explained in the frame\nof generalized linear Lorentz transformation; this is the case when the time\nrequired by the light to cover a poligonal is not in the ratio with the time\nrequired to cover the apotheme, which is provided by the Euclidean geometry Notice that the explanation is not found in supposing that the light\nspeed along the perimeter is different from the one along the apotheme (on\nthe contrary, from the point of view of a local observer the velocity of a\nphoton along its trajectory is always c [(] 25)), but in requiring that the space\nstructure is no more Euclidean Analogously, the experiments by Shapiro et al [(26)] and Reasenberg et\nal [(27)] on the radar echo delay show that an e m wave travelling close to\n\n\n5\n\n\nthe Sun appears not only deviated, but also slightly retarded to an observer\nin a far flat region This phenomenon too cannot be explained by supposing\na delay for the light which comes from the Sun to the Earth, but must be\nsettled in the general relativity frame ### 5 Acknowledgments\n\n\nThanks are due to professors John L Hall and Giuseppe Marmo for useful\n\ndiscussions ### 6 References\n\n\n1 G F Smoot, M V Gorenstein and R A Muller, Phys Rev Lett 39, 898\n(1977)\n2 R M Mansouri and R U Sexl, J Gen Rel Grav 8, 497 (1977); 8,515\n(1977); 8,809 (1977)\n3 H P Robertson, Rev Mod Phys 21, 378 (1949); H",
