and although they require more\nskill to make, yet are preferable for the beginner, because he does not\nrequire to reach so far over the board, and furthermore, they teach\nhim more quickly and effectively He who can make a fair drawing\nhaving short lines and small curves can make a better one if it has\nlarge curves, etc , because it is easier to draw a large than a very small\ncircle or curve It is unnecessary to enter into a description of the\nvarious kinds of drawing boards in use, because if the student\npurchases one he will be duly informed of the kinds and their special\nfeatures, while if he intends to make one the sketch in Figure 1 will\ngive him all the information he requires, save that, as before noted,\nthe wood must be soft pine, well seasoned and free from knots, while\nthe battens B should be dovetailed in and the face of the board trued\nafter they are glued and driven in To true the edges square, it is best\nto make the two longest edges parallel and straight, and then the ends\nmay be squared from those long edges",
    "To true the edges square, it is best\nto make the two longest edges parallel and straight, and then the ends\nmay be squared from those long edges Fig 1 THE T SQUARE Drawing squares or T squares, as they are termed, are made of wood,\nof hard rubber and of steel There are several kinds of T squares; in one the blade is solid, as it is\nshown in Figure 5 on page 20; in another the back of the square is\npivoted, so that the blade can be set to draw lines at an angle as well\nas across the board, which is often very convenient, although this\ndouble back prevents the triangles, when used in some positions, from\ncoming close enough to the left hand side of the board In an\nimproved form of steel square, with pivoted blade, shown in Figure 2,\nthe back is provided with a half circle divided into the degrees of a\ncircle, so that the blade can be set to any required degree of angle at\nonce Fig 2 Fig 3 Fig 4 THE TRIANGLES Fig 5 Two triangles are all that are absolutely necessary for a beginner The\nfirst is that shown in Figure 3, which is called a triangle of 45 degrees,\nbecause its edge A is at that angle to edges B and C That in Figure 4\nis called a triangle of 60 degrees, its edge A being at 60 degrees to B,\nand at 30 degrees to C The edges P and C are at a right angle or an\nangle of 90 degrees in both figures; hence they are in this respect\nalike By means of these triangles alone, a great many straight line\ndrawings may be made with ease without the use of a drawing square;\n\n\nbut it is better for the beginner to use the square at first The manner\nof using these triangles with the square is shown in Figure 5, in which\nthe triangle, Figure 3, is shown in three positions marked D E F, and\nthat shown in Figure 4 is shown in three positions, marked\nrespectively G H and I It is obvious, however, that by turning I over,\nend for end, another position is attained The usefulness in these\nparticular triangles is because in the various positions shown they are\ncapable of use for drawing a very large proportion of the lines that\noccur in mechanical drawing The principal requirement in their use is\nto hold them firmly to the square-blade without moving it, and\nwithout permitting them to move upon it The learner will find that\nthis is best attained by so regulating the height of the square-blade\nthat the line to be drawn does not come down too near the bottom of\nthe triangle or edge of the square-blade, nor too high on the triangle;\nthat is to say, too near its uppermost point It is the left-hand edge of\nthe triangle that is used, whenever it can be done, to produce the\nrequired line Fig 6 CURVES To draw curves that are not formed of arcs or parts of circles,\ntemplates called curves are provided, examples of these forms being\ngiven in Figure 6 They are made in wood and in hard rubber, the\nlatter being most durable; their uses are so obvious as to require no\nexplanation It may be remarked, however, that the use of curves\ngives excellent practice, because they must be adjusted very\naccurately to produce good results, and the drawing pen must be held\nin the same vertical plane, or the curve drawn will not be true in its\noutline DRAWING INSTRUMENTS It is not intended or necessary to enter into an elaborate discussion of\nthe various kinds of drawing instruments, since the purchaser can\nobtain a good set of drawing instruments from a reputable dealer by\npaying a proportionate price, and must per force learn to use such as\nhis means enable him to purchase It is recommended that the\n\n\nbeginner purchase as good a set of instruments as his means will\npermit, and that if his means are limited he purchase less than a full\nset of instruments, having the same of good quality All the instruments that need be used in the examples of this book are\nas follows:\nA small spring bow-pen for circles, a lining pen or pen for straight\nlines, a small spring bow-pencil for circles, a large bow-pen with a\nremovable leg to replace by a divider leg or a pencil leg, and having\nan extension piece to increase its capacity The spring bow-pen should have a stiff spring, and should be opened\nout to its full capacity to see that the spring acts well when so opened\nout, keeping the legs stiff when opened for the larger diameters The\npurchaser should see that the joint for opening and closing the legs is\nan easy but not a loose fit on the screw, and that the legs will not\nmove sideways To test this latter, which is of great importance in the\nspring bow-pencil as well as in the pen, it is well to close the legs\nnearly together and taking one leg in one hand and the other leg in\nthe other hand (between the forefinger and thumb), pushing and\npulling them sideways, any motion in that direction being sufficient to\ncondemn the instrument It is safest and best to have the two legs of\nthe bow-pen and pencil made from one piece of metal, and not of two\nseparate pieces screwed together at the top, as the screw will rarely\nhold them firmly together The points should be long and fine, and as\nround as possible In very small instruments separate points that are\nfastened with a screw are objectionable, because, in very small circles,\nthey hide the point and make it difficult to apply the instrument to\nthe exact proper point or spot on the drawing The joints of the large bow or circle-pen should also be somewhat\nstiff, and quite free from side motion, and the extension piece should\nbe rigidly secured when held by the screw It is a good plan in\npurchasing to put in the extension piece, open the joint and the pen to\ntheir fullest, and draw a circle, moving the pen in one direction, and\nthen redraw it, moving it in the other direction, and if one line only\nappears and that not thickened by the second drawing, the pen is a\ngood one The lead pencil should be of hard lead, and it is recommended that\nthey be of the H, H, H, H, H, H, in the English grades, which\n\n\ncorresponds to the V, V, H, of the Dixon grade The pencil lines should\nbe made as lightly as possible; first, because the presence of the lead\non the paper tends to prevent the ink from passing to the paper; and,\nsecondly, because in rubbing out the pencil lines the ink lines are\nreduced in blackness and the surface of the paper becomes roughened,\nso that it will soil easier and be harder to clean In order to produce\nfine pencil lines without requiring a very frequent sharpening of the\npencil it is best to sharpen the pencil as in Figures 7 and 8, so that the\nedge shall be long in the direction in which it is moved, which is\ndenoted by the arrow in Figure 7 But when very fine work is to be\ndone, as in the case of Patent Office drawings, a long, round point is\npreferable, because the eye can see plainer just where the pencil will\nbegin to mark and leave off; hence the pencil lines will not be so\nliable to overrun Fig 7 Fig 8 In place of the ordinary wood-covered lead pencils there may be\nobtained at the drawing material stores pencil holders for holding the\nfine, round sticks of lead, and these are by far the best for a learner They are easier to sharpen, and will slip in the holder, giving warning\nwhen the draftsman is pressing them too hard on the paper, as he is\napt to do The best method of trimming these leads, as also lead\npencils after they have been roughly shaped, is with a small fine file,\nholding the file still and moving the pencil; or a good piece of emery\npaper or sand paper is good, moving the pencil as before All lines in pencilling as in inking in should begin at the left hand and\nbe drawn towards the right, or when triangles are used the lines are\nbegun at the bottom and drawn towards the top or away from the\noperator The rubber used should not be of a harsh grade, since that\nwill roughen the face of the paper and probably cause the ink to run The less rubbing out the better the learner will progress, and the more\nsatisfaction he will receive from the results If it becomes necessary to\nscratch out it is best done with a penknife well sharpened, and not\napplied too forcibly to the paper but somewhat lightly, and moved in\ndifferent and not all in one direction After the penknife the rubber\nmay sometimes be used to advantage, since it will, if of a smooth\n\n\ngrade, leave the paper smoother than the knife Finally, before inking\nin, the surface that has been scraped should be condensed again by\nrubbing some clean, hard substance over it which will prevent the ink\nfrom spreading The end of a paper-cutter or the end of a rounded\nivory handled drawing instrument is excellent for this purpose Fig 9 Fig 10",
    "10 It is well to use the rubber for general purposes in such a way as to fit\nit for special purposes; thus, in cleaning the sheet of paper, the rubber\nmay be applied first, as in Figure 9, as at A, and then as at B, and if it\nbe moved sideways at the same time it will wear to the form shown in\nFigure 10, which will enable it to be applied along a line that may\nrequire to be rubbed out without removing other and neighboring\nlines If the rubber is in the form of a square stick one end may be\nbevelled, as in Figure 11, which is an excellent form, or it may be\nmade to have a point, as in Figure 12 The object is in each case to\nenable the rubber action to be confined to the desired location on the\npaper, so as to destroy its smooth surface as little as possible Fig 11 Fig 12 For simple cleaning purposes, or to efface the pencil lines when they\nare drawn very lightly, squares of sponge-rubber answer admirably,\nthese being furnished by the dealers in drawing materials A piece of bread will answer a similar purpose, but it is less\nconvenient For glazed surface paper, as Bristol-board, the smoothest rubber must\nbe used, the grade termed velvet rubber answering well THE DRAWING PAPER Whatever kind of drawing paper be used it should be kept dry, or the\nink, however good it may be, will be apt to run and make a thick line\nthat will not have the sharp, clean edges necessary to make lines look\nwell Drawing paper is made in various qualities, kinds, and forms, as\nfollows: The sizes and names of paper made in sheets are:\nCap, 13 × 16 inches Demy, 20 × 15 \"\nMedium, 22 × 17 \"\nRoyal, 24 × 19 \"\nSuper Royal, 27 × 19 \"\nImperial, 30 × 21 \"\nElephant, 28 × 22 \"\nColumbier, 34 × 23 \"\nAtlas, 33 × 26 \"\nTheorem, 34 × 28 \"\nDouble Elephant, 40 × 26 \"\nAntiquarian, 52 × 31 \"\nEmperor, 40 × 60 \"\nUncle Sam, 48 × 120 \"\nthe thickness of the sheets increasing with their size Some sheets of\npaper are hot pressed, to give a smoother surface, and thus enable\ncleaner-edged lines to be drawn Fig 13",
    "13 For large drawings paper is made in rolls of various widths, but as\nrolled paper is troublesome to lay flat upon the drawing board, it is\nrecommended to the learner to obtain the sheets, which may be laid\nsufficiently flat by means of broad headed pins, such as shown in\nFigure 13, which are called thumb tacks These are forced through the\npaper into the board at each corner, as in Figure 14 at f On account\nof the large diameter of the stems of these thumb tacks, which unduly\npierce and damage the board, and on account also of their heads, by\nreason of their thickness, coming in the way of the square blade, it\nwill be found preferable to use the smallest sizes of ordinary iron\ntacks, with flat heads, whose stems are much finer and heads much\nthinner than thumb tacks The objection to ordinary tacks is that they\nare more difficult to remove, but they are, as stated, more desirable\nfor use Fig 14 Fig 15 15 If the paper is nearly the full size of the board, it does not much\nmatter as to its precise location on the board, but otherwise it is best\nto place it as near the left-hand edge of the board as convenient, as is\nshown in Figure 14 The lower edge, D, Figure 15, of the paper, however, should not be\nplaced too near the edge, A, of the board, because if the end P of the\nsquare back comes down below the edge of the board, it is more\ndifficult to keep the square back true against the end of the board The paper must lie flat upon and close to the surface of the board, and\na sufficient number of tacks must be used to effect this purpose Drawings that are to be intricate, or to contain a great many lines, as\na drawing of an engine or of a machine, are best pasted or glued all\naround the edges of the paper, which should first be dampened; but as\nthe learner will scarcely require to make such drawings until he is\nsomewhat familiar with and well practised in the use of the\ninstruments, this part of the subject need not be treated here TRACING PAPER For taking tracings from drawings tracing paper or tracing cloth is\nused They require to be stretched tightly and without wrinkles upon\nthe drawing To effect this object the mucilage should be thick, and\nthe tracing paper should be dampened with a sponge after it is pasted It must be thoroughly dry before use, or the ink will run Tracing cloth must be fastened by pins or thumb tacks, and not\ndampened The drawing should be made on the polished side of the\ncloth, and any coloring to be done should be on the other side, and\ndone after the tracing is removed from the drawing THE INK India ink should always be used for mechanical drawing: First,\nbecause it lies upon and does not sink into the paper, and is,\ntherefore, easily erased; and, secondly, because it does not corrode or\ninjure the drawing instruments India ink is prepared in two forms—in the stick and in a liquid form The stick ink is mixed in what are termed saucers, or cabinet saucers,\none being placed above the other, so as to exclude the dust from\nsettling in it, and also to prevent the rapid evaporation to which it is\nsubject The surface of the saucer should be smooth, as any roughness grinds\nthe ink too coarsely, whereas the finer it is ground or mixed the easier\nit will flow, the less liability to clog the instruments, and the smoother\nand more flat it will lie upon the paper In mixing the ink only a small\nquantity of water should be used, the stick of ink being pressed lightly\nupon the saucer and moved quickly, the grinding being continued\nuntil the ink is mixed quite thickly This will grind the ink fine as it is\nmixed, and more water may be added to thin it It is best, however, to\nlet the ink be somewhat thick for use, and to keep it covered when\nnot in use; and though water may be added if it gets too thick, yet ink\nthat has once dried should not be mixed up again, as it will not work\nso well after having once dried Of liquid inks the Higgins ink is by far the best, being quite equal to\nand much more convenient for use than the best stick ink The difference between a good and an inferior India ink lies chiefly in\nthe extent to which the lamp-black, which is the coloring matter,\nforms with the water a chemical solution rather than a mechanical\nmixture In inferior ink the lamp-black is more or less held in\nsuspension, and by prolonged exposure to the air will separate, so that\non being spread the solid particles will aggregate by themselves and\nthe water by itself This explains why draughtsmen will, after the ink has been exposed to\nthe air for an hour or two, add a drop of mucilage to it; the mucilage\nthickening the solution, adding weight to the water, and deferring the\nseparation of the lamp-black A good India ink is jet black, flows easily, lies close to, does not stand\nupon or sink into the paper, and has an even lustre, the latter being an\nindication of fineness The more perfect the incorporation of the lamp-\nblack with the water the easier the ink will flow, the less liable it is to\nclog the instruments, the more even and sharp the edges of the lines,\nand the finer the lines that may be drawn Usually India ink can only be tested by actual trial; but since it is\n\n\ndesirable to test before purchasing it, it may be mentioned that one\nmethod is to mix a little on the finger nail, and if it has a \"bronzy\"\ngloss it is a good indication It should also spread out and dry without\nany tendency to separate The best method of testing is to mix a very little, and drop a single\ndrop in a tumbler of clear water The best ink will diffuse itself over\nthe surface, and if the water is disturbed will diffuse itself through the\nwater, leaving it translucent and black, with a slight tinge of bronze\ncolor A coarser ink will act in a similar manner, but make the water\nsomewhat opaque, with a blue-black, or dull, ashy color A still\ncoarser ink will, when diffused over the surface of the water, show\nfine specks, like black dust, on the surface This is readily apparent,\nshowing that the mixture of the ink is not homogeneous When it is an object to have the lines of a drawing show as black as\npossible, as for drawings that are to be photo-engraved, the ink should\nbe mixed so thickly as to have a tendency to lift when a body, such as\na lead pencil, is lifted out of it For Patent Office drawings some will\nmix it so thickly that under the above test it appears a little stringy The thicker the ink can be used the better, because the tendency of\nthe carbon to separate is less; and it is for this reason that the test\nmentioned with a tumbler of water is so accurate When ink is to be\nused on parchment, or glossy tracing-paper, it will flow perfectly if a\nfew drops of ox-gall be mixed with it; but on soft paper, or on bristol\nboard, this will cause the ink to spread For purposes of measurement, there are special rules or scales of steel\nand of paper manufactured The steel rules are finely and accurately\ndivided, and some are of triangular form, so that when laid upon the\npaper the lines divided will lie close to the paper, and the light will\nfall directly on the ruled surface Triangular rules or scales are\ntherefore much superior to flat ones The object of having a paper rule\nor scale is, that the paper will expand and contract under varying\ndegrees of atmospheric moisture, the same as the drawing paper does Figure 16 represents a triangular scale, having upon it six different\ndivisions of the inch These are made in different patterns, having\neither decimal divisions or the vulgar fractions Being made of steel,\nand nickel-plated, they are proof against the moisture of the fingers,\nand are not subject to the variation of the wooden scale Fig 16 CHAPTER II THE PREPARATION AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS The points of drawing instruments require to be very accurately\nprepared and shaped, to enable them to make clean, clear lines The\nobject is to have the points as sharp as they can be made without\ncutting the paper, and the curves as even and regular as possible Fig 17 Fig 18 The lining pen should be formed as in Figure 17, which presents an\nedge and a front view of the points The inside faces should be flat\nacross, and slightly curved in their lengths, as shown If this curve is\ntoo great, as shown exaggerated in Figure 18, the body of the ink lies\ntoo near the point and is apt to flow too freely, running over the pen-\npoint and making a thick, ragged line On the other hand, if the inside\nfaces, between which the ink lies, are too parallel and narrow near the\npoints, the ink dries in the pen, and renders a too frequent cleaning\nnecessary Looking at the face of the pen as at A in Figure 17, its point\nshould have an even curve, as shown, the edge being as sharp as it\ncan be made without cutting the drawing paper Upon this quality\ndepends the fineness and cleanness of the lines it will make This thin\nedge should extend around the curve as far as the dotted line, so that\nit will be practicable to slant the pen in either of the directions shown\nin Figure 19; and it is obvious that its thickness must be equal around\nthe arc, so that the same thickness of line will be drawn whether the\npen be held vertical or slanted in either direction Fig 19 Fig 20 The outside faces of the pen should be slightly curved, so that when\nheld vertically, as in Figure 20 (the dotted line representing the centre\nof the length of the instrument), and against the square blade S, the\n\n\npoint will meet the paper a short distance from the lower edge of S as\nshown By this means it is not necessary to adjust the square edge\nexactly coincident with the line, but a little way from it This is an\nadvantage for two reasons: first, the trouble of setting the square-edge\nexactly coincident is avoided, and, secondly, the liability of the ink to\nadhere to the edge of the square-blade and flow on to the paper and\nmake a thick, ragged line, is prevented The square being set as near to the line as desired, the handle may be\nheld at such an angle that the pen-point will just meet the line when\nsloped either as in Figure 21 or 22 If, however, the slope be too much\nin the direction shown in Figure 21, practice is necessary to enable\nthe drawing of straight lines if they be long ones, because any\nvariation in the angle of the instrument to the paper obviously vitiates\nthe straightness of the line If, on the other hand, the square be too\nclose to the line, and the pen therefore requires to be sloped as in\nFigure 22, the ink flowing from the pen-point is apt to adhere to the\nsquare-edge, and the result will be a ragged, thick line, as shown in\nFigure 23 Fig 21 Fig 22 Fig 23 Fig 24 Fig 25 Fig 26",
    "26 Each of the legs should be of equal thickness at the pen-point edge, so\nthat when closed together the point will be in the middle of the edge The width and curve of each individual point should be quite equal,\nand the easiest method of attaining this end is as follows:\nTake a small slip of Arkansas oil-stone, and with the pen-points closed\nfirmly by the screw trim the pen-edges to the required curve as shown\n\n\nat A, Figure 17, making the curve as even as possible Then stone the\nfaces until this curve is brought up to a sharp edge at the point\nbetween the two pen-legs forming the point Next take a piece of 000 French emery paper, lay it upon some flat\nbody like the blade of a square, and smooth the curve of the edge\nenough to take off the fine, sharp edge left by the oil-stone; then apply\nthe outside flat faces of the pen to the emery paper again, bringing the\npen-edge up sharp The emery paper will simply have smoothed and polished the\nsurfaces, still leaving them too sharp, so sharp as to cut the paper, and\nto take off this sharp edge (which must first be done on the inside\nfaces) open the pen-points as wide as the screw will permit Then\nwrap one thickness of the emery paper upon a thin blade, as upon a\ndrawing-triangle, and pass the open pen-points over it, and move the\ninstrument endwise, taking care to keep the inside face level with the\nsurface of the emery paper, so that the pen-points shall not cut\nthrough Next close the pen-points with the screw until they nearly,\nbut not quite, touch, and sweep the edge of the pen-point along the\nemery paper under a slight pressure, so moving the handle that at\neach stroke the whole length around the curved end of the pen will\nmeet the emery surface During this motion the inside faces of the\npen-point must be held as nearly vertical as possible, so as to keep the\ntwo halves of the pen-point equal The pen is now ready for use, and will draw a fine and clean line It is not usual to employ emery paper for the purpose indicated, but it\nwill be found very desirable, since it leaves a smoother surface and\nedge than the oil-stone alone Circle-pens are more difficult to put in order than the straight-line\npen, especially those for drawing the smallest circles, which cannot be\nwell drawn unless the pen is of the precise right shape and in the best\ncondition A circle-pen is shown in Figure 24, in which A represents the point-leg\nand B the pen-leg The point-leg must be the longest because it\nrequires to enter the drawing paper before the pen meets the surface The point should be sharp and round, for any edges or angles on it\nwill cause it to widen the hole in the paper when it is rotated To\n\n\nshape the points to prevent the enlargement of the centre in the paper\nis one of the most important considerations in the use of this\ninstrument, especially when several circles require to be drawn from\nthe same centre To accomplish this end the inside of the point-leg\nshould be, as near as possible, parallel to the length of the instrument\n(which is denoted in Figure 24 by the dotted line) when the legs are\nclosed, as in the figure If the point is at an angle, as shown in Figure\n25, it is obvious that rotating it will enlarge the top of the centre in\nthe drawing paper The point should be sharp and smooth on its\ncircumferential surface, and so much longer than the pen-point that it\nwill have sufficient hold in the paper when the instrument stands\nvertical and the pen-point meets the surface of it, which amount is\nabout 1/64th of an inch We may now consider the shape of the pen-point Its inside surfaces\nshould be flat across and to the curve shown in Figure 24, not as\nshown exaggerated in Figure 25, because in the latter the body of the\nink will be too near the pen-point, and but little can be placed in it\nwithout causing it sometimes to flow over the edges and down the\noutside of the pen A form of pen-point recently introduced is shaped as in Figure 26, the\nobject being to have a thin stream of ink near the marking pen-point\nand the main body of the ink near at hand, instead of extending up\nthe pen, as would be the case with Figure 24 The advantage thus\ngained is that the ink lies in a more solid body, and having less area of\nsurface exposed to the air will not dry so quickly in the pen; but this is\nmore than offset by the liability of the ink to flow over the crook at A,\nand cause the pen to draw a thick ragged line The pen-point must be\nslightly inclined toward the needle-point, to the end that they may\napproach each other close enough for drawing very small circles, but\nit should also stand as nearly vertical as will permit that end to be\nattained As this pen is for drawing small circles only, it does not\nrequire much ink, and hence may be somewhat close together, as in\nFigure 24; this has the advantage that the point is not hidden from\nobservation In forming the pen-point the greatest refinement is necessary to\nenable the drawing of very small true circles, say 1/16th of an inch,\nor less, in diameter The requirements are that the pen-point shall\nmeet the surface of the paper when the needle-point has entered it\n\n\nsufficiently to give the necessary support, and that the instrument\nshall stand vertical, as shown by the dotted line in Figure 24 Also,\nthat the pen shall then touch the paper at a point only, this point\nbeing the apex of a fine curve; that this curve be equal on each side of\nthe point of contact with the paper; that both halves forming the pen\nbe of equal thickness and width at the pointed curve; and that the\npoint be as sharp as possible without cutting the paper The best method of attaining these ends is as follows: On each side of\nthe pen make, with an oil-stone, a flat place, as C D, Figure 27 (where\nthe pen-point is shown magnified), thus bringing both halves to an\nedge of exactly equal length, and leaving the point flat at D These flat\nplaces must be parallel to one another and to the joint between the\ntwo halves of the pen As the oil-stone may leave a slightly ragged\nedge, it is a good plan to take a piece of 00 French emery paper, lay it\non a flat surface, and holding the instrument vertically remove the\nfine edge D until it will not cut Then with the oil-stone shape the\ncurved edge as in Figure 28, taking care that the curve no more than\nbrings the flat place D up to a true curve and leaves the edge sharp,\nwith only the very point touching the paper, which is represented in\nthe cut by the horizontal line Figure\n27 Figure\n28 Figure\n29 Figure\n30 Figure\n31 Figure\n32 The point must have a sharp edge all around the curve, and the two\n\n\nhalves must be exactly equal in width, for if one half is wider than the\nother, as in Figure 29 at a, or as in Figure 30 at b, it will be\nimpossible to draw a very small circle true So, likewise, the two\nhalves of the pen must be of exactly equal length, and not one half\nlonger than the other, as in Figures 31 or 32, which would tend to cut\nthe paper, and also render the drawing of true small circles\nimpracticable When the pen is closed to draw a very small circle the two halves of\nthe pen-leg should have an equal degree of contact with the surface of\nthe paper, and then as the legs are opened out to draw larger circles\nthe contact of the outside half of the pen will have less contact with\nthe paper The smaller the circle, the more difficult it is to keep the\npoint-leg from slipping out of the centre, and the more difficult it is to\ndraw a clear line and true circle; hence the points should be shaped to\nthe best advantage for drawing these small circles, by oil-stoning the\npen, as already described, and then finishing it as follows:\nAfter the oil-stoning, open the two valves of the pen-leg wide enough\nto admit a piece of 000 French emery paper wrapped once around a\nvery thin blade, and move the pen endwise as described for the\nstraight-line pen This will smooth the inner surfaces and remove any\nfine wire-edge that the oil-stone may leave Close the two halves of\nthe pen again, and lightly emery-paper the outside faces, which will\nleave the edge sharp enough to cut the paper The removal of the\nsharp edge still left, to the exact degree, requires great care It may\nbest be done by closing the pen until its two halves very nearly, but\nnot quite, touch, then adjust it to mark a circle of about 3/16 inch\ndiameter, and strike a number of circles in different locations upon\nthe surface of a piece of 0000 French emery paper In marking these circles, however, let the instrument stand out of the\nperpendicular, and do very little while standing vertically Indeed, it\nis well to strike a number of half-circles, first from right to left and\nthen from left to right, and finally draw a full circle, sloping the pen\non one side, gradually raising it vertically, and finally sloping it to the\nother side This will insure that the pen has contact at its extreme\npoint, and leave that point fine and keen, but not enough so to cut the\npaper To test the pen, draw small circles with the pen rotated first in\none direction and then in the other, closing its points so as to mark a\nfine line, which, if the pen is properly shaped, will be clear and fine,\n\n\nwhile if improperly formed the circle drawn with the pen rotated in\none direction will not coincide with that drawn while rotating it in\nthe other The same circle may be drawn over several times to make a\nthorough test If a drawing instrument will draw a fine line correctly,\nit will be found to answer for thick lines which are more easily made In thus preparing the instruments, the operator will find that if he\noccasionally holds the points in the right position with regard to the\nlight, he will be able to see plainly if the work is proceeding evenly\nand equally, for if one-half of the pen is thicker at the point or edge\nthan the other, it will show a brighter line This is especially the case\nwith instruments that have become dull by use, for in that case the\nedges will be found quite bright, and any inequality of thickness\nshows plainly",
    "This is especially the case\nwith instruments that have become dull by use, for in that case the\nedges will be found quite bright, and any inequality of thickness\nshows plainly Fig 33 Fig 34 34 It follows, from what has been said, that the needle-point and pen-\npoint should stand vertical when in use, and to effect this the\ninstruments, except in the smallest sizes, are provided with joints,\nsuch as shown at A and B in the bow-pencil or circle-pencil, in Figure\n33 These joints should be sufficiently stiff that they will not move too\neasily, and yet will move rather than that the legs should sensibly\nspring without moving at the joint The needle-point leg should be\nadjusted by means of the joint, to stand vertical, and the same\nremarks apply equally to the pen-leg; but in the case of the pencil-leg\nit is the pencil itself and not the leg that requires attention, the joint B\nbeing so adjusted that the pencil either stands vertical, or, what is\nperhaps preferable, so that it stands inclined slightly towards the\nneedle-point In sharpening the pencil the inner face C may be made\nconcave or at least vertical and flat, and the outer convex or else\nbevelled and flat, producing a fine and long edge rounded in its length\nof edge In using the circle-pencil and circle-pen it will be found more\nconvenient to rotate it in the direction of the arrow in Figure 34 It\nshould be held lightly to the paper, and the learner will find that he\nhas a natural tendency to hold it too firmly and press it too heavily,\nwhich is especially to be avoided If in drawing a small circle the needle-point slips out of the paper, it is\n\n\nbecause the pencil-point is too long; or, what is the same thing, the\nneedle-point does not protrude far enough out from the leg Or if the\ninstrument requires to be leaned over too much to make the pencil or\npen mark, it is because the pen or pencil is not far enough out, and\nthis again may cause the needle-point to slip out of the paper Fig 35 In Figure 35 is shown a German instrument especially designed to\navoid this slipping The peculiarity of this instrument consists in the\narrangement of the centre point, which remains stationary whilst the\npen or pencil, resting by its own weight on the paper, is guided round\nby gently turning, without pressure, the small knob at the upper end\nof the tube By this means the misplacing or sliding of the centre-point\nand the cutting of the paper by the pen are avoided By means of this\nfixed centre-point any number of concentric circles may be drawn,\nwithout making a hole of very distinguishable size on the paper Fig 36 Fig 37 In applying the ink to the bow-pen as to all other instruments, care\nmust be taken that the ink lies between the points only and not on the\noutside, for in the latter case the ink will flow down too freely and\nmake a broad, ragged line, perhaps getting on the edge of the square\nblade or triangle, and causing a blot of ink on the drawing In using a straight line or lining pen with a T square it may be used as\nin Figure 36, being nearly vertical, as shown, and moved from left to\nright as denoted by the arrow, S representing the square blade But in\nusing it, or a pencil, with a straight edge or a triangle unsupported by\nthe square blade, the latter should be steadied by letting the fingers\nrest upon it while using the instrument, the operation being shown in\nFigure 37 The position, Figure 36, is suitable for long lines, and that\nin Figure 37 for small drawings, where the pen requires close\nadjustment to the lines CHAPTER III LINES AND CURVES Although the beginner will find that a study of geometry is not\nessential to the production of such elementary examples of\nmechanical drawing as are given in this book, yet as more difficult\nexamples are essayed he will find such a study to be of great\nadvantage and assistance Meantime the following explanation of\nsimple geometrical terms is all that is necessary to an understanding\nof the examples given The shortest distance between two points is termed the radius; and, in\nthe case of a circle, means the distance from the centre to the\nperimeter measured in a straight line Fig 38 Fig 39 Fig 40",
    "40 Dotted lines, thus, <——- >, mean the direction and the points at\nwhich a dimension is taken or marked Dotted lines, thus,——-,\nsimply connect the same parts or lines in different views of the object Thus in Figure 38 are a side and an end view of a rivet, and the dotted\nlines show that the circles on the end view correspond to the circle of\nthe diameters of the head and of the stem, and therefore represent\ntheir diameters while showing that both are round A straight line is\nin geometry termed a right line A line at a right angle to another is said to be perpendicular to it;\nthus, in Figures 39, 40, and 41, lines A are in each case perpendicular\nto line B, or line B is in each case perpendicular to line A A point is a position or location supposed to have no size, and in cases\nwhere necessary is indicated by a dot Parallel lines are those equidistant one from the other throughout\n\n\ntheir length, as in Figure 42 Lines maybe parallel though not straight;\nthus, in Figure 43, the lines are parallel Fig 41 Fig 42 Fig 43 Fig 44 Fig 45 Fig 46 A line is said to be produced when it is extended beyond its natural\nlimits: thus, in Figure 44, lines A and B are produced in the point C A line is bisected when the centre of its length is marked: thus, line A\nin Figure 45 is bisected, at or in, as it is termed, e The line bounding a circle is termed its circumference or periphery\nand sometimes the perimeter A part of this circumference is termed an arc of a circle or an arc; thus\nFigure 46 represents an arc When this arc has breadth it is termed a\nsegment; thus Figures 47 and 48 are segments of a circle A straight\nline cutting off an arc is termed the chord of the arc; thus, in Figure\n48, line A is the chord of the arc Fig 47 Fig 48 Fig 49 Fig 50 Fig 51 A quadrant of a circle is one quarter of the same, being bounded on\ntwo of its sides by two radial lines, as in Figure 49 When the area of a circle that is enclosed within two radial lines is\n\n\neither less or more than one quarter of the whole area of the circle the\nfigure is termed a sector; thus, in Figure 50, A and B are both sectors\nof a circle A straight line touching the perimeter of a circle is said to be tangent\nto that circle, and the point at which it touches is that to which it is\ntangent; thus, in Figure 51, line A is tangent to the circle at point B The half of a circle is termed a semicircle; thus, in Figure 52, A B and\nC are each a semicircle Fig 52 Fig 53",
    "53 The point from which a circle or arc of a circle is drawn is termed its\ncentre The line representing the centre of a cylinder is termed its\naxis; thus, in Figure 53, dot d represents the centre of the circle, and\nline b b the axial line of the cylinder To draw a circle that shall pass through any three given points: Let A\nB and C in Figure 54 be the points through which the circumference\nof a circle is to pass Draw line D connecting A to C, and line E\nconnecting B to C Bisect D in F and E in G From F as a centre draw\nthe semicircle O, and from G as a centre draw the semicircle P; these\ntwo semicircles meeting the two ends of the respective lines D E From\nB as a centre draw arc H, and from C the arc I, bisecting P in J From\nA as a centre draw arc K, and from C the arc L, bisecting the\nsemicircle O in M Draw a line passing through M and F, and a line\npassing through J and Q, and where these two lines intersect, as at Q,\nis the centre of a circle R that will pass through all three of the points\nA B and C Fig 54 Fig 55 To find the centre from which an arc of a circle has been struck: Let A\nA in Figure 55 be the arc whose centre is to be found From the\nextreme ends of the arc bisect it in B From end A draw the arc C, and\nfrom B the arc D Then from the end A draw arc G, and from B the arc\nF Draw line H passing through the two points of intersections of arcs\nC D, and line I passing through the two points of intersection of F G,\n\n\nand where H and I meet, as at J, is the centre from which the arc was\ndrawn A degree of a circle is the 1/360 part of its circumference The whole\ncircumference is supposed to be divided into 360 equal divisions,\nwhich are called the degrees of a circle; but, as one-half of the circle is\nsimply a repetition of the other half, it is not necessary for mechanical\npurposes to deal with more than one-half, as is done in Figure 56 As\nthe whole circle contains 360 degrees, half of it will contain one-half\nof that number, or 180; a quarter will contain 90, and an eighth will\ncontain 45 degrees In the protractors (as the instruments having the\ndegrees of a circle marked on them are termed) made for sale the\nedges of the half-circle are marked off into degrees and half-degrees;\nbut it is sufficient for the purpose of this explanation to divide off one\nquarter by lines 10 degrees apart, and the other by lines 5 degrees\napart The diameter of the circle obviously makes no difference in the\nnumber of decrees contained in any portion of it Thus, in the quarter\nfrom 0 to 90, there are 90 degrees, as marked; but suppose the\ndiameter of the circle were that of inner circle d, and one-quarter of it\nwould still contain 90 degrees Fig 56",
    "56 So, likewise, the degrees of one line to another are not always taken\nfrom one point, as from the point O, but from any one line to another Thus the line marked 120 is 60 degrees from line 180, or line 90 is 60\ndegrees from line 150 Similarly in the other quarter of the circle 60\ndegrees are marked This may be explained further by stating that the\npoint O or zero may be situated at the point from which the degrees\nof angle are to be taken Here it may be remarked that, to save\nwriting the word \"degrees,\" it is usual to place on the right and above\nthe figures a small °, as is done in Figure 56, the 60° meaning sixty\ndegrees, the °, of course, standing for degrees Fig 57 Suppose, then, we are given two lines, as a and b in Figure 57, and are\nrequired to find their angle one to the other Then, if we have a\nprotractor, we may apply it to the lines and see how many degrees of\n\n\nangle they contain This word \"contain\" means how many degrees of\nangle there are between the lines, which, in the absence of a\nprotractor, we may find by prolonging the lines until they meet in a\npoint as at c From this point as a centre we draw a circle D, passing\nthrough both lines a, b All we now have to do is to find what part, or\nhow much of the circumference, of the circle is enclosed within the\ntwo lines In the example we find it is the one-twelfth part; hence the\nlines are 30 degrees apart, for, as the whole circle contains 360, then\none-twelfth must contain 30, because 360÷12 = 30 Fig 58 If we have three lines, as lines A B and C in Figure 58, we may find\ntheir angles one to the other by projecting or prolonging the lines\nuntil they meet as at points D, E, and F, and use these points as the\ncentres wherefrom to mark circles as G, H, and I Then, from circle H,\nwe may, by dividing it, obtain the angle of A to B or of B to A By\ndividing circle I we may obtain the angle of A to C or of C to A, and\nby dividing circle G we may obtain the angle of B to C or of C to B Fig 59 Fig 60 It may happen, and, indeed, generally will do so, that the first attempt\nwill not succeed, because the distance between the lines measured, or\nthe arc of the circle, will not divide the circle without having the last\ndivision either too long or too short, in which case the circle may be\ndivided as follows: The compasses set to its radius, or half its\ndiameter, will divide the circle into 6 equal divisions, and each of\nthese divisions will contain 60 degrees of angle, because 360 (the\nnumber of degrees in the whole circle) ÷6 (the number of divisions)\n= 60, the number of degrees in each division We may, therefore,\nsubdivide as many of the divisions as are necessary for the two lines\nwhose degrees of angle are to be found Thus, in Figure 59, are two\nlines, C, D, and it is required to find their angle one to the other The\ncircle is divided into six divisions, marked respectively from 1 to 6,\nthe division being made from the intersection of line C with the circle As both lines fall within less than a division, we subdivide that\ndivision as by arcs a, b, which divide it into three equal divisions, of\nwhich the lines occupy one division Hence, it is clear that they are at\n\n\nan angle of 20 degrees, because twenty is one-third of sixty When the\nnumber of degrees of angle between two lines is less than 90, the lines\nare said to form an acute angle one to the other, but when they are at\nmore than 90 degrees of angle they are said to form an obtuse angle Thus, in Figure 60, A and C are at an acute angle, while B and C are at\nan obtuse angle F and G form an acute angle one to the other, as also\ndo G and B, while H and A are at an obtuse angle Between I and J\nthere are 90 degrees of angle; hence they form neither an acute nor an\nobtuse angle, but what is termed a right-angle, or an angle of 90\ndegrees E and B are at an obtuse angle Thus it will be perceived that\nit is the amount of inclination of one line to another that determines\nits angle, irrespective of the positions of the lines, with respect to the\ncircle TRIANGLES A right-angled triangle is one in which two of the sides are at a right\nangle one to the other Figure 61 represents a right-angled triangle, A\nand B forming a right angle The side opposite, as C, is called the\nhypothenuse The other sides, A and B, are called respectively the\nbase and the perpendicular Fig 61 Fig 62 Fig 63 Fig 64 An acute-angled triangle has all its angles acute, as in Figure 63 An obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle, as A, Figure 62 When all the sides of a triangle are equal in length and the angles are\nall equal, as in Figure 63, it is termed an equilateral triangle, and\neither of its sides may be called the base When two only of the sides\nand two only of the angles are equal, as in Figure 64, it is termed an\nisosceles triangle, and the side that is unequal, as A in the figure, is\ntermed the base Fig 65 Fig 66 When all the sides and angles are unequal, as in Figure 65, it is\ntermed a scalene triangle, and either of its sides may be called the\nbase The angle opposite the base of a triangle is called the vertex Fig 67 Fig 68",
    "68 A figure that is bounded by four straight lines is termed a quadrangle,\nquadrilateral or tetragon When opposite sides of the figure are\nparallel to each other it is termed a parallelogram, no matter what the\nangle of the adjoining lines in the figure may be When all the angles\nare right angles, as in Figure 66, the figure is called a rectangle If the\nsides of a rectangle are of equal length, as in Figure 67, the figure is\ncalled a square If two of the parallel sides of a rectangle are longer\nthan the other two sides, as in Figure 66, it is called an oblong If the\nlength of the sides of a parallelogram are all equal and the angles are\nnot right angles, as in Figure 68, it is called a rhomb, rhombus or\ndiamond If two of the parallel sides of a parallelogram are longer\nthan the other two, and the angles are not right angles, as in Figure\n69, it is called a rhomboid If two of the parallel sides of a\nquadrilateral are of unequal lengths and the angles of the other two\nsides are not equal, as in Figure 70, it is termed a trapezoid Fig 69 Fig 70 Fig 71 If none of the sides of a quadrangle are parallel, as in Figure 71, it is\ntermed a trapezium THE CONSTRUCTION OF POLYGONS Fig 71 a Fig 72 The term polygon is applied to figures having flat sides equidistant\nfrom a common centre From this centre a circle may be struck that\nwill touch all the corners of the sides of the polygon, or the point of\neach side that is central in the length of the side In drawing a\npolygon, one of these circles is used upon which to divide the figure\ninto the requisite number of divisions for the sides When the\ndimension of the polygon across its corners is given, the circle drawn\nto that dimension circumscribes the polygon, because the circle is\nwithout or outside of the polygon and touches it at its corners only When the dimension across the flats of the polygon is given, or when\nthe dimension given is that of a circle that can be inscribed or marked\nwithin the polygon, touching its sides but not passing through them,\nthen the polygon circumscribes or envelops the circle, and the circle is\ninscribed or marked within the polygon Thus, in Figure 71 a, the\ncircle is inscribed within the polygon, while in Figure 72 the polygon\nis circumscribed by the circle; the first is therefore a circumscribed\nand the second an inscribed polygon A regular polygon is one the\nsides of which are all of an equal length NAMES OF REGULAR POLYGONS A figure of 3 sides is called a\nTrigon \"\n4\n\"\nTetragon polygon\n5\n\"\nPentagon \"\n6\n\"\nHexagon \"\n7\n\"\nHeptaagon \"\n8\n\"\nOctagon \"\n9\n\"\nEnneagon or Nonagon Fig 73 Fig 74",
    "74 The angles of regular polygons are designated by their degrees of\nangle, \"at the centre\" and \"at the circumference \" By the angle at the\ncentre is meant the angle of a side to a radial line; thus in Figure 73 is\na hexagon, and at C is a radial line; thus the angle of the side D to C is\n60 degrees Or if at the two ends of a side, as A, two radial lines be\ndrawn, as B, C, then the angles of these two lines, one to the other,\n\n\nwill be the \"angle at the centre \" The angle at the circumference is the\nangle of one side to its next neighbor; thus the angle at the\ncircumference in a hexagon is 120 degrees, as shown in the figure for\nthe sides E, F It is obvious that as all the sides are of equal length,\nthey are all at the same angle both to the centre and to one another In Figure 74 is a trigon, the angles at its centre being 120, and the\nangle at the circumference being 60, as marked The angles of regular polygons:\nTrigon, at the centre, 120°, at the circumference, 60° Tetragon,\n\"\n90°,\n\"\n\"\n90° Pentagon,\n\"\n72°,\n\"\n\"\n108° Hexagon,\n\"\n60°,\n\"\n\"\n120° Octagon,\n\"\n45°,\n\"\n\"\n135° Enneagon,\n\"\n40°,\n\"\n\"\n140° Decagon,\n\"\n36°,\n\"\n\"\n144° Dodecagon,\n\"\n30°,\n\"\n\"\n150° THE ELLIPSE An ellipse is a figure bounded by a continuous curve, whose nature\nwill be shown presently The dimensions of an ellipse are taken at its extreme length and\nnarrowest width, and they are designated in three ways, as by the\nlength and breadth, by the major and minor axis (the major axis\nmeaning the length, and the minor the breadth of the figure), and the\nconjugate and transverse diameters, the transverse meaning the\nshortest, and the conjugate the longest diameter of the figure In this book the terms major and minor axis will be used to designate\nthe dimensions The minor and major axes are at a right angle one to the other, and\ntheir point of intersection is termed the axis of the ellipse In an ellipse there are two points situated upon the line representing\nthe major axis, and which are termed the foci when both are spoken\nof, and a focus when one only is referred to, foci simply being the\n\n\nplural of focus These foci are equidistant from the centre of the\nellipse, which is formed as follows: Two pins are driven in on the\nmajor axis to represent the foci A and B, Figure 75, and around these\npins a loop of fine twine is passed; a pencil point, C, is then placed in\nthe loop and pulled outwards, to take up the slack of the twine The\npencil is held vertical and moved around, tracing an ellipse as shown Fig 75 Now it is obvious, from this method of construction, that there will be\nat every point in the pencil's path a length of twine from the final\npoint to each of the foci, and a length from one foci to the other, and\nthe length of twine in the loop remaining constant, it is demonstrated\nthat if in a true ellipse we take any number of points in its curve, and\nfor each point add together its distance to each focus, and to this add\nthe distance apart of the foci, the total sum obtained will be the same\nfor each point taken Fig 76 Fig 77 In Figures 76 and 77 are a series of ellipses marked with pins and a\npiece of twine, as already described The corresponding ellipses, as A\nin both figures, were marked with the same loop, the difference in the\ntwo forms being due to the difference in distance apart of the foci Again, the same loop was used for ellipses B in both figures, as also\nfor C and D From these figures we perceive that—\n1st With a given width or distance apart of foci, the larger the\ndimensions are the nearer the form of the figure will approach to that\nof a circle 2d The nearer the foci are together in an ellipse, having any given\ndimensions, the nearer the form of the figure will approach that of a\ncircle 3d That the proportion of length to width in an ellipse is determined\nby the distance apart of the foci",
    "That the proportion of length to width in an ellipse is determined\nby the distance apart of the foci 4th That the area enclosed within an ellipse of a given circumference\nis greater in proportion as the distance apart of the foci is diminished;\nand,\n5th That an ellipse may be given any required proportion of width to\nlength by locating the foci at the requisite distance apart The form of a true ellipse may be very nearly approached by means of\nthe arcs of circles, if the centres from which those arcs are struck are\nlocated in the most desirable positions for the form of ellipse to be\ndrawn Fig 78 Thus in Figure 78 are three ellipses whose forms were pencilled in by\nmeans of pins and a loop of twine, as already described, but which\nwere inked in by finding four arcs of circles of a radius that would\nmost closely approach the pencilled line; a b are the foci of all three\nellipses A, B, and C; the centre for the end curves of a are at c and d,\nand those for its side arcs are at e and f For B the end centres are at g\nand h, and the side centres at i and j For C the end centres are at k, l,\nand the side centres at m and n It will be noted that, first, all the\ncentres for the end curves fall on the line of the length or major axis,\nwhile all those for the sides fall on the line of width or the minor axis;\nand, second, that as the dimensions of the ellipses increase, the\ncentres for the arcs fall nearer to the axis of the ellipse Now in\nproportion as a greater number of arcs of circles are employed to form\nthe figure, the nearer it will approach the form of a true ellipse; but in\npractice it is not usual to employ more than eight, while it is obvious\nthat not less than four can be used When four are used they will\nalways fall somewhere on the lines on the major and minor axis; but if\neight are used, two will fall on the line of the major axis, two on the\nline of the minor axis, and the remaining four elsewhere Fig 79 In Figure 79 is a construction wherein four arcs are used Draw the\nline a b, the major axis, and at a right angle to it the line c d, the\nminor axis of the figure Now find the difference between the length\nof half the two axes as shown below the figure, the length of line f\n(from g to i) representing half the length of the figure (as from a to e),\nand the length or radius from g to h equalling that from e to d; hence\nfrom h to i is the difference between half the major and half the minor\naxis With the radius (h i), mark from e as a centre the arcs j k, and\njoin j k by line l Take half the length of line l and from j as a centre\nmark a line on a to the arc m Now the radius of m from e will be the\nradius of all the centres from which to draw the figure; hence we may\ndraw in the circle m and draw line s, cutting the circle Then draw line\no, passing through m, and giving the centre p From p we draw the\nline q, cutting the intersection of the circle with line a and giving the\ncentre r From r we draw line s, meeting the circle and the line c, d,\ngiving us the centre t From t we draw line u, passing through the\ncentre m These four lines o, q, s, u are prolonged past the centres,\nbecause they define what part of the curve is to be drawn from each\ncentre: thus from centre m the curve from v to w is drawn, from centre\nt the curve from w to x is drawn From centre r the curve from x to y\nis drawn, and from centre p the curve from y to v is drawn It is to be\nnoted, however, that after the point m is found, the remaining lines\nmay be drawn very quickly, because the line o from m to p may be\ndrawn with the triangle of 45 degrees resting on the square blade The\ntriangle may be turned over, set to point p and line q drawn, and by\nturning the triangle again the line s may be drawn from point r;\nfinally the triangle may be again turned over and line u drawn, which\nrenders the drawing of the circle m unnecessary To draw an elliptical figure whose proportion of width to breadth\nshall remain the same, whatever the length of the major axis may be:\nTake any square figure and bisect it by the line A in Figure 80 Draw,\nin each half of the square, the diagonals E F, G H From P as a centre\nwith the radius P R draw the arc S E R With the same radius draw\nfrom O as a centre the arc T D V With radius L C draw arc R C V, and\nfrom K as a centre draw arc S B T Fig 80 Fig 81",
    "81 A very near approach to the true form of a true ellipse may be drawn\nby the construction given in Figure 81, in which A A and B B are\ncentre lines passing through the major and minor axis of the ellipse, of\nwhich a is the axis or centre, b c is the major axis, and a e half the\nminor axis Draw the rectangle b f g c, and then the diagonal line b e;\nat a right angle to b e draw line f h, cutting B B at i With radius a e\nand from a as a centre draw the dotted arc e j, giving the point j on\nline B B From centre k, which is on the line B B and central between\nb and j, draw the semicircle b m j, cutting A A at l Draw the radius of\nthe semicircle b m j, cutting it at m, and cutting f g at n With the\nradius m n mark on A A at and from a as a centre the point o With\nradius h o and from centre h draw the arc p o q With radius a l and\nfrom b and c as centres, draw arcs cutting p o q at the points p q Draw\nthe lines h p r and h q s and also the lines p i t and q v w From h as a\ncentre draw that part of the ellipse lying between r and s, with radius\np r; from p as a centre draw that part of the ellipse lying between r\nand t, with radius q s, and from q as a centre draw the ellipse from s\nto w, with radius i t; and from i as a centre draw the ellipse from t to b\nand with radius v w, and from v as a centre draw the ellipse from w to\nc, and one-half of the ellipse will be drawn It will be seen that the\nwhole construction has been performed to find the centres h, p, q, i\nand v, and that while v and i may be used to carry the curve around\non the other side of the ellipse, new centres must be provided for h p\nand q, these new centres corresponding in position to h p q Divesting\nthe drawing of all the lines except those determining its dimensions\nand the centres from which the ellipse is struck, we have in Figure 82\nthe same ellipse drawn half as large The centres v, p, q, h correspond\nto the same centres in Figure 81, while v', p', q', h' are in\ncorresponding positions to draw in the other half of the ellipse The\nlength of curve drawn from each centre is denoted by the dotted lines\nradiating from that centre; thus, from h the part from r to s is drawn;\nfrom h' that part from r' to s' At the ends the respective centres v are\nused for the parts from w to w' and from t to t' respectively Fig 82 Fig 83 The most correct method of drawing an ellipse is by means of an\ninstrument termed a trammel, which is shown in Figure 83 It consists\n\n\nof a cross frame in which are two grooves, represented by the broad\nblack lines, one of which is at a right angle to the other In these\ngrooves are closely fitted two sliding blocks, carrying pivots E F,\nwhich may be fastened to the sliding blocks, while leaving them free\nto slide in the grooves at any adjusted distance apart These blocks\ncarry an arm or rod having a tracing point (as pen or pencil) at G When this arm is swept around by the operator, the blocks slide in the\ngrooves and the pen-point describes an ellipse whose proportion of\nwidth to length is determined by the distance apart of the sliding\nblocks, and whose dimensions are determined by the distance of the\npen-point from the sliding block To set the instrument, draw lines\nrepresenting the major and minor axes of the required ellipse, and set\noff on these lines (equidistant from their intersection), to mark the\nrequired length and width of ellipse Place the trammel so that the\ncentre of its slots is directly over the point or centre from which the\naxes are marked (which may be done by setting the centres of the\nslots true to the lines passing through the axis) and set the pivots as\nfollows: Place the pencil-point G so that it coincides with one of the\npoints as C, and place the pivot E so that it comes directly at the point\nof intersection of the two slots, and fasten it there Then turn the arm\nso that the pencil-point G coincides with one of the points of the\nminor axis as D, the arm lying parallel to B D, and place the pivot F\nover the centre of the trammel and fasten it there, and the setting is\ncomplete Fig 84 To draw a parabola mechanically: In Figure 84 C D is the width and H\nJ the height of the curve Bisect H D in K Draw the diagonal line J K\nand draw K E, cutting K at a right angle to J K, and produce it in E With the radius H E, and from J as a centre, mark point F, which will\nbe the focus of the curve At any convenient distance above J fasten a\nstraight-edge A B, setting it parallel to the base C D of the parabola Place a square S with its back against the straight-edge, setting the\nedge O N coincident with the line J H Place a pin in the focus F, and\ntie to it one end of a piece of twine Place a tracing-point at J, pass the\ntwine around the tracing-point, bringing down along the square-blade\nand fasten it at N, with the tracing-point kept against the edge of the\n\n\nsquare and the twine kept taut; slide the square along the straight-\nedge, and the tracing-point will mark the half J C of the parabola Turn the square over and repeat the operation to trace the other half J\nD This method corresponds to the method of drawing an ellipse by\nthe twine and pins, as already described Fig 85 To draw a parabola by lines: Bisect the width A B in Figure 85, and\ndivide each half into any convenient number of equal divisions; and\nthrough these points of division draw vertical lines, as 1, 2, 3, etc (in\neach half) Divide the height A D at one end and B E at the other into\nas many equal divisions as the half of A B is divided into From the\npoints of divisions 1, 2, 3, etc , on lines A D and B E, draw lines\npointing to C, and where these lines intersect the corresponding\nvertical lines are points through which the curve may be drawn Thus\non the side A D of the curve, the intersection of the two lines marked\n1 is a point in the curve; the intersection of the two lines marked 2 is\nanother point in the curve, and so on TO DRAW A HEART CAM Fig 86 Draw the line A B, Figure 86, equal to the length of stroke required Divide it into any number of equal parts, and from C as a centre draw\ncircles through the points of division Draw the outer circle and divide\nits circumference into twice as many equal divisions as the line A B\nwas divided into Draw radial lines from each point of division on the\ncircle, and the points of intersection of the radial lines with the circles\nare points for the outline of the cam, and through these points a\ncurved line may be drawn giving the shape of the cam It is obvious\nthat the greater the number of divisions on A B, the more points and\nthe more perfect the curve may be drawn CHAPTER IV SHADOW LINES AND LINE SHADING SECTION LINING OR CROSS-HATCHING When the interior of a piece is to be shown as a piece cut in half, or\nwhen a piece is broken away, as is done to make more of the parts\nshow, or show more clearly, the surface so broken away or cut off is\nsection-lined or cross-hatched; that is to say, diagonal lines are drawn\nacross it, and to distinguish one piece from another these lines are\ndrawn at varying angles and of varying widths apart In Figure 87 is\ngiven a view of three cylindrical pieces It may be known to be a\nsectional view by the cross-hatching or section lines It would be a\ndifficult matter to represent the three pieces put together without\nshowing them in section, because, in an outline view, the collars and\nrecesses would not appear Each piece could of course be drawn\nseparately, but this would not show how they were placed when put\ntogether They could be shown in one view if they were shaded by\nlines and a piece shown broken out where the collars and, recesses\nare, but line shading is too tedious for detail drawings, beside\ninvolving too much labor in their production Fig 87 Figure 88 represents a case in which there are three cylindrical pieces\none within the other, the two inner ones being fastened together by a\nscrew which is shown dotted in in the end view, and whose position\nalong the pieces is shown in the side view The edges of the fracture\nin the outer piece are in this case cross-hatched, to show the line of\nfracture Fig 88 Fig 89",
    "89 In cross-hatching it is better that the diagonal lines do not quite meet\n\n\nthe edges of the piece, than that they should in the least overrun, as is\nshown in Figure 89, where in the top half the diagonals slightly\noverrun, while in the lower half they do not quite meet the outlines of\nthe piece In Figure 90 are shown in section a number of pieces one within the\nother, the central bore being filled with short plugs All the cross-\nhatching was done with the triangle of 60 degrees and that of 90\ndegrees It is here shown that with these two triangles only, and a\njudicious arrangement of the diagonals, an almost infinite number of\npieces may be shown in cross section without any liability of\nmistaking one for the other, or any doubt as to the form and\narrangement of the pieces; for, beside the difference in spacing in the\ncross-hatching, there are no two adjoining pieces with the diagonals\nrunning in the same direction It will be seen that the narrow pieces\nare most clearly defined by a close spacing of the cross-hatching Fig 90 In Figure 91 are shown three pieces put together and having slots or\nkeyways through them The outer shell is shown to be in one piece\nfrom end to end, because the cross-hatching is not only equally\nspaced, but the diagonals are in the same direction; hence it would be\nknown that D, F, H, and E were slots or recesses through the piece The same remarks apply to piece B, wherein G, J, K are recesses or\nslots Piece C is shown to have in its bore a recess at L In the case of\nB, as of A, there would be no question as to the piece being all one\nfrom end to end, notwithstanding that the two ends are completely\nsevered where the slots G, I, come, because the spacing and direction\nof the cross-hatching are equal on each side of the slots, which they\nwould not be if they were separate pieces Fig 91 Fig 92",
    "92 Section shading or cross-hatching may sometimes cause the lines of\nthe drawing to appear crooked to the eye Thus, in Figure 92, the key\nedge on the right appears curved inwards, while on the left the key\nedge appears curved outwards, although such is not actually the case The same effect is produced in Figure 93 on the right-hand edge of the\n\n\nkey, but not on the left-hand edge Fig 93\nFig 94 A remarkable instance of this kind is shown in Figure 94, when the\nvertical lines appear to the eye to be at a considerable angle one to\nthe other, although they are parallel The lines in sectional shading or cross-hatching may be made to\ndenote the material of which the piece is to be composed Thus\nProfessor Unwin has proposed the system shown in the Figures 95 and\n96 This may be of service in some cases, but it would involve very\nmuch more labor than it is worth in ordinary machine shop drawings,\nexcept in the case of cast iron and wood, these two being shown in\nthe simplest and the usual manner It is much better to write the name\nof the material beneath the piece in a detail drawing Fig 95 Fig 96 LINE SHADING Mechanical drawings are made to look better and to show more\ndistinctly by being line shaded or shaded by lines The simplest form\nof line shading is by the use of the shade or shadow line In a mechanical drawing the light is supposed, for the purposes of line\nshading or of coloring, to come in from the upper left-hand corner of\nthe drawing paper; hence it falls directly upon the upper and left-hand\nlines of each piece, which are therefore represented by fine lines,\nwhile the right hand and lower edges of the piece being on the\nshadow side may therefore, with propriety, be represented by broader\nlines, which are called shadow or shade lines These lines will often\nserve to indicate the shape of some part of the piece represented, as\nwill be seen from the following examples In Figure 97 is a piece that\ncontains a hole, the fact being shown by the circle being thickened at\nA If the circle were thickened on the other side as at B, in Figure 98,\nit would show that it represented a cylindrical stem instead of a hole Fig 97 Fig 98 Fig 99 In Figure 99 is represented a washer, the surfaces that are in the\nshadow side being shown in a shade line or shadow line, as it is often\ncalled In Figure 100 is a key drawn with a shade line, while in Figure 101\nthe shade line is shown applied to a nut The shade line may be\nproduced in straight lines by drawing the line twice over, and slightly\n\n\ninclining the pen, or by opening the pen points a little For circles,\nhowever, it may be produced either by slightly moving the centre\nfrom which the circle is drawn, or by going over the shade part twice,\nand slightly pressing the instrument as it moves, so as to gradually\nspring the legs farther apart, the latter plan being generally\npreferable Fig 100 Fig 101 Fig 102 Figure 102 shows a German pen, that can be regulated to draw lines\nof various breadths The head of the adjusting screw is made rather\nlarger than usual, and is divided at the under side into twenty\ndivisional notches, each alternate notch being marked by a figure on\nthe face By this arrangement a uniform thickness of line may be\nmaintained after filling or clearing the pen, and any desired thickness\nmay be repeated, without any loss of time in trial of thickness on the\npaper A small spring automatically holds the divided screw-head in\nany place With very little practice the click of the spring in the\nnotches becomes a sufficient guide for adjustment, without reference\nto the figures on the screw-head Another meritorious feature of this\npen is that it is armed with sapphire points, which retain their\nsharpness very long, and thus save the time and labor required to\nkeep ordinary instruments in order for the performance of fine work An example of line shading in perspective drawing is shown in the\ndrawing of a pipe threading stock and die in Figure 103 Fig 103",
    "103 Shading by means of lines may be used with excellent effect in\nmechanical drawing, not only to distinguish round from flat surfaces,\nbut also to denote to the eye the relative distances of surfaces Figure\n104 represents a cylindrical pin line shaded As the light is supposed\nto come in from the upper left-hand corner, it will evidently fall more\n\n\nupon the left-hand half of the stem, and of the collar or bead, hence\nthose parts are shaded with lighter or finer lines than the right-hand\nsides are Fig 104 Fig 105 Two cylindrical pieces that join each other may be line shaded at\nwhatever angle they may join Figure 105 represents two such pieces,\none at a right angle to the other, both being of equal diameter Fig 106 Figure 106 represents a drawing of a lathe centre shaded by lines, the\nlines on the taper parts meeting those on the parallel part A, and\nbecoming more nearly parallel to the axis of the piece as the centre of\nthe piece is approached The same is the case where a piece having a\ncurved outline is drawn, which is shown in Figure 107, where the set\nof the bow-pen is gradually increased for drawing the shade lines of\nthe curves The centres of the shade curves fall in each case upon a\nline at a right angle to the axis of the piece, as upon the lines A, B, C,\nthe dotted lines showing the radius for each curve Fig 107",
    "107 The lines are made finer by closing the pen points by means of the\nscrew provided for that purpose The pen requires for this purpose to\nbe cleaned of the ink that is apt to dry in it In Figure 108 line shading is shown applied to a ball or sphere, while\nin Figure 109 it is shown applied to a pin in a socket which is shown\nin section By showing the hollow in connection with the round piece,\nthe difference between the two is quite clearly seen, the light falling\nmost upon the upper half of the pin and the lower half of the hole This perhaps is more clearly shown in the piece of tube in Figure 110,\nwhere the thickness of the tube showing is a great aid to the eye So,\nlikewise, the hollow or hole is more clearly seen where the piece is\nshown in section, as in Figure 111, which is the case even though the\n\n\npiece be taper as in the figure If the body be bell-mouthed, as in\nFigure 112, the hollow curve is readily shown by the shading; but to\nline shade a hollow curve without any of these aids to the eye, as say,\nto show a half of a tin tube, is a very difficult matter if the piece is to\nlook natural; and all that can be done is to shade the top darkly and\nlet the light fall mostly at and near the bottom An example of line\nshading to denote the relative distances from the eye of various\nsurfaces is given in Figure 113, where the surfaces most distant are\nthe most shaded The flat surfaces are lined with lines of equal\nbreadth, the degrees of shading being governed by the width apart of\nthe lines",
    "The flat surfaces are lined with lines of equal\nbreadth, the degrees of shading being governed by the width apart of\nthe lines Fig 108 Fig 109 Fig 110 Fig 111 Fig 112 Fig 113 Line shading is often used to denote that the piece represented is to be\nof wood, the shade lines being in some cases regular in combination\nwith regular ones, or entirely irregular, as in Figure 114 Fig 114 CHAPTER V MARKING DIMENSIONS The dimensions of mechanical drawings are best marked in red ink so\nthat they will show plainly, and that the lines denoting the points at\nwhich the dimension is given shall not be confounded with the lines\nof the drawing The dimension figures should be as large as the drawing will\nconveniently admit; and should be marked at every point at which a\nshoulder or change of form or dimension occurs, except in the case of\nstraight tapers which have their dimensions marked at each end of the\ntaper In the case of a single piece standing by itself the dimension figures\nmay be marked all standing one way, so as to be read without\nchanging the position of the operator or requiring to turn the drawing\naround This is done in Figure 115, which represents the drawing of a\nkey The figures are here placed outside the drawing in all cases\nwhere it can be done, which, in the case of a small drawing, leaves\nthe same clearer Fig 115 In Figure 116 the dimensions are marked, running parallel to the\ndimension for which they are given, so that all measures of length\nstand lengthwise, and those of breadth across the drawing Fig 116 Figure 117 represents a key with a sharp-cornered step in it Here the\ntwo dimensions forming the steps cannot both be coincident with it;\nhence they are marked as near to it as convenient, it being understood\nthat they apply to the step, and not to one side of it When the step\nhas a round instead of a sharp corner, the radius of the arc of the\ncorner may be marked, as shown in Figure 118 Fig 117 Figure 119 represents a key drawn in perspective, so that all the\ndimensions may be marked on one view Perspective sketches may be\nused for single pieces, as they denote the shape of the piece more\nclearly to the eye On account of the skill required in their production,\nthey are not, however, used in mechanical drawing, except as in the\ncase of Patent-Office or similar drawings, where the form and\nconstruction rather than the dimension is the information sought to be\nconveyed Fig 118 Fig 119 CHAPTER VI THE ARRANGEMENT OF DIFFERENT VIEWS THE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF A MECHANICAL DRAWING The word elevation, as applied to mechanical drawing, means simply a\nview; hence a side elevation is a side view, or an end elevation is an\nend view The word plan is employed in place of the word top; hence a plan\nview is a top view, or a view looking down upon the top of the piece A general view means a view showing the machine put together or\nassembled, while a detail drawing is one containing a detail, as a part\nof the machine or a single piece disconnected from the other parts of\nthe whole machine It is obviously desirable in a mechanical drawing to present the piece\nof work in as few views as possible, but in all cases there must be a\nsufficient number to permit of the dimensions in every necessary\ndirection to be marked on the drawing Suppose, then, that in Figure\n120 we have to represent a solid cylinder, whose length equals its\ndiameter, and it is obvious that both the diameter and length may be\nmarked in the one view given; hence, a second view, such as shown\nby the circle in Figure 121, is unnecessary, except it be to distinguish\nthe body from a cube, in which the one view would also be sufficient\nwhereon to mark all the dimensions necessary to enable the piece to\nbe made It happens, however, that a cube and a cylinder are the only\ntwo figures upon which all the dimensions can be marked on one view\nof the piece, and as cylindrical pieces are much more common in\nmachine work than cubes are, it is taken for granted that, where the\npieces are cylindrical, but one view shall be used, and that where they\nare cubes either two views shall be given, or where they are square a\ncross shall be marked upon the parts that are square; thus, in Figure\n122, is shown a cross formed by the lines A B across the face of the\ndrawing, which saves making a second view Fig 120 Fig 121 Fig 122 Fig 123 It would appear that under some conditions this might lead to error;\nas, for example, take the piece in Figure 123, and there is nothing to\ndenote which is the length and which is the diameter of the piece, but\nthere is a certain amount of custom in such cases than will usually\ndetermine this point; thus, the piece will be given a name, as pin or\ndisk, the one denoting that its diameter is less than its length, and the\nother that its diameter is greater than its length In the absence of any\nsuch name, it would be in practice assumed that it was a pin and not a\ndisk; because, if it were a disk, it would either be named or shaded, or\na second view given to show its unusual form, the disk being a more\nunusual form than the pin-form in mechanical structures As an\nexample of the use of the cross to denote a square, we have Figure\n124, which represents a piece having a hexagon head, section a, a',\nthat is rectangular, a collar b, a square part c, and a round stem d Here it will be noted that it is the rectangular part a, a', that renders\nnecessary two views, and that in the absence of the cross, yet another\nview would be necessary to show that part c is square Fig 124 Fig 125 Fig 126",
    "126 A rectangular piece always requires two views and sometimes three In Figure 125, for example, is a piece that would require a side view\nto show the length and breadth, and an edge view to show the\nthickness Suppose the piece to be wedge-shaped in any direction;\nthen another view will be necessary, as is shown in Figs Suppose the piece to be wedge-shaped in any direction;\nthen another view will be necessary, as is shown in Figs 126 and 127 126 and 127 In the former the wedge or taper is in the direction of its length, while\nin the latter it is in the direction of its thickness Outline views,\nhowever, will not in some cases show the form of the figure, however\nmany views be presented An example of this is given in Figure 128,\nwhich represents a ring having a hexagon cross section A sectional\nedge view is here necessary in order to show the hexagonal form Another example of this kind, which occurs more frequently in\npractice, is a cupped ring such as shown in Figure 129 Fig 127 Fig 128 Fig 129 Fig 130 EXAMPLES Let it be required to draw a rectangular piece such as is shown in two\nviews in Figure 130, and the process for the pencil lines is as follows:\nFig 131 With the bow-pencil set to half the required length and breadth of the\nsquare the arcs 1, 2, 3 and 4, in Figure 131, are marked, and then the\nlines 5 and 6, letting them run past the width of the arcs 3 and 4 There is no need to pencil in lines 7 and 8, since they can be inked in\nwithout pencilling, because it is known that they must meet the arcs 3\nand 4 and terminate at the lines 5 and 6 The top and bottom lines of\nthe edge view are merely prolongations of lines 5 and 6; hence the\nlines 9 and 10 are drawn the requisite distance apart for the thickness\nand to meet the top and bottom lines The lines are then inked in, the\npencil lines rubbed out, and the drawing will appear as in Figure 130 Fig 132 Fig 133 Suppose, however, that the piece has a step in it, as in Figure 132, and\nthe pencilling will be as in Figure 133 From the centre, the arcs 1, 2,\n3 and 4 for the outer, and arcs 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the inner square are\nmarked; lines 9 and 10, and their prolongations, 11 and 12, for the\nedge view, are then pencilled; lines 13 and 14, and their\nprolongations, 15 and 16, are then pencilled, and dots to show the\nlocations for lines 21 and 22 maybe marked and the pencilling is\ncomplete Lines 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 may then be inked in,\nin the order named, and then lines 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16,\n\n\nwhen the inking in will be complete Fig 134 In inking in horizontal lines begin at the top and mark in each line as\nthe square comes to it; and in inking the vertical ones begin always at\nthe left hand line and mark the lines as they are come to, moving the\nsquare or the triangle to the right, and great care should be taken not\nto let the lines cross where they meet, as at the corners, since this\nwould greatly impair the appearance of the drawing These figures have been drawn without the aid of a centre line,\nbecause from their shapes it was easy to dispense with it, but in most\ncases a centre line is necessary; thus in Figure 134 we have a body\nhaving a number of steps The diameters of these steps are marked by\narcs, as in the previous examples, and their lengths may be marked by\napplying the measuring rule direct to the drawing paper and making\nthe necessary pencil mark But it would be tedious to mark the successive steps true one with the\nother by measuring each step, because one step would require to be\npencilled in before the next could be marked To avoid this the centre\nline 1, Figure 134, is first marked, and the arcs for the steps are then\nmarked as shown Centre lines are also necessary to show the\nalignment of one part to another; thus in Figure 135 is a cube with a\nhole passing through it The dotted lines in the side view show that\nthe hole passes clear through the piece and is a parallel one, while the\ncentre line, being central to the outline throughout the piece, shows\nthat the hole is equidistant, all through, from the walls of the piece Fig 135 Fig 136 The pencil lines for this piece would be marked as in Figure 136, line\n1 representing the centre line from which all the arcs are marked It\nwill be noted that the length of the piece is marked by arcs which\noccur, because being a cube the set of the compasses for arcs 2, 3, 4\nand 5 will answer without altering to mark arcs 6 and 7 Fig 137 If the hole in the piece were a taper or conical one, it would be\ndenoted by the dotted lines, as in Figure 137, and that the taper is\ncentral to the body is shown by these dotted lines being equidistant\nfrom the centre line Fig 138 Suppose one of the sides to be tapered, as is the side A, in Figure 138,\nand that the hole is not central, and both facts will be shown by the\ncentre lines 1 and 2 in the figure The measurement of face A would\nbe marked from A to line B at each end, but the distance the hole was\nout of the centre would be marked by the distance between the centre\nline 2 and the edge C of the piece Fig 139 If the hole did not pass entirely through the piece, the dotted lines\nwould show it, as in Figure 139 Fig 140 Fig 141",
    "141 The designations of the views of a piece of work depend upon the\nposition in which the piece stands, when in place upon the machine of\nwhich it forms a part Thus in Figure 140 is a lever, and if its shaft\nstood horizontal when the piece is in place in the machine, the view\ngiven is an end one, but suppose that the shaft stood vertical, and the\nsame view becomes a plan or top view Fig 142 Fig 143 In Figure 142 is a view of a lever which is a side view if the lever\nstands horizontal, and lever B hangs down, or a plan view if the shaft\nstands horizontal, but lever B stands also horizontal We may take the\n\n\nsame drawing and turn it around on the paper as in Figure 143, and it\nbecomes a side view if the shaft stands vertical, and a plan view if the\nshaft stands horizontal and arm D vertical above it In a side or an end view, the piece that projects highest in the drawing\nis highest when upon the machine; also in a side elevation the piece\nthat is at the highest point in the drawing extends farthest upward\nwhen the piece is on the machine But in a plan or top view the height\nof vertical pieces is not shown, as appears in the case of arm D in\nFigure 143 Fig 144 In either of the levers, Figures 142 or 143, all the dimensions could be\nmarked if an additional view were given, but this will not be the case\nif an eye have a slot in it, as at E, in Figure 144, or a jaw have a\ntongue in it, as at F: hence, end views of the eye and the jaw must be\ngiven, which may be most conveniently done by showing them\nprojected from the ends of those parts as in the figure This naturally brings us to a consideration as to the best method of\nprojecting one view from another As a general rule, the side elevation\nor side view is the most important, because it shows more of the parts\nand details of the work; hence it should be drawn first, because it\naffords more assistance in drawing the other views Fig 145",
    "145 There are two systems of placing the different views of a piece In the\nfirst the views are presented as the piece would present itself if it were\nlaid upon the paper for the side view, and then turned or rolled upon\nthe paper for the other views, as shown in Figure 145, in which the\npiece consists of five sections or members, marked respectively A, B,\nC, D, and E Now if the piece were turned or rolled so that the end\nface of B were uppermost, and the member E was beneath, it will, by\nthe operation of turning it, have assumed the position in the lower\nview marked position 2; while if it were turned over upon the paper\nin the opposite direction it would assume the position marked 3 This\ngives to the mind a clear idea of the various views and positions; but\nit possesses some disadvantages: thus, if position 1 is a side elevation\nor view of the piece, as it stands when in place of the machine, then E\n\n\nis naturally the bottom member; but it is shown in the top view of the\ndrawing, hence what is actually the bottom view of the piece (position\n3) becomes the top view in the drawing A second disadvantage is\nthat if we desire to put in dotted lines, to show how one view is\nderived from the other, and denote corresponding parts, then these\ndotted lines must be drawn across the face of the drawing, making it\nless distinct; thus the dotted lines connecting stem E in position 1 to E\nin position 3, pass across the faces of both A and B of position 1 Fig 146 In a large drawing, or one composed of many members or parts, it\nwould, therefore, be out of the question to mark in the dotted lines A\nfurther disadvantage in a large drawing is that it is necessary to go\nfrom one side of the drawing to the other to see the construction of\nthe same part Fig 147",
    "147 To obviate these difficulties, a modern method is to suppose the piece,\ninstead of rolling upon the paper, to be lifted from it, turned around\nto present the required view, and then moved upwards on the paper\nfor a top view, sideways for a side view, and below for a bottom view Thus the three views of the piece in Figure 145 would be as in Figure\n146, where position 2 is obtained by supposing the piece to be lifted\nfrom position 1, the bottom face turned uppermost, and the piece\nmoved down the paper to position 2, which is a bottom view of the\npiece, and the bottom view in the drawing Similarly, if the piece be\nlifted from position 1, and the top face in that figure is turned\nuppermost, and the piece is then slid upwards on the paper, view 3 is\nobtained, being a top view of the piece as it lies in position 1, and the\ntop view in the drawing Now suppose we require to find the shape of\nmember B, then in Figure 145 we require to look at the top of position\n1, and then down below to position 2 Fig 148 But in Figure 146 we have the side view and end view both together,\nwhile the dotted lines do not require to cross the face of the side view Now suppose we take a similar piece, and suppose its end faces, as F,\nG, to have holes in them, which require to be shown in both views,\n\n\nand under the one system the drawing would, if the dotted lines were\ndrawn across, appear as in Figure 147, whereas under the other\nsystem the drawing would appear as in Figure 148 And it follows that\nin cases where it is necessary to draw dotted lines from one view to\nthe other, it is best to adopt the new system CHAPTER VII",
    "CHAPTER VII EXAMPLES IN BOLTS, NUTS, AND POLYGONS Fig 149 Fig 150 Fig 151 151 Let it be required to draw a machine screw, and it is not necessary,\nand therefore not usual in small screws to draw the full outline of the\nthread, but to represent it by thick and thin lines running diagonally\nacross the bolt, as in Figure 149, the thick ones representing the\nbottom, and the thin ones the top of the thread The pencil lines\nwould be drawn in the order shown in Figure 150 Line 1 is the centre\nline, and line 2 a line to represent the lower side of the head; from the\nintersection of these two lines as a centre (as at A) short arcs 3 and 6,\nshowing the diameter of the thread, are marked, and the arcs 5 and 6,\nrepresenting the depth of the thread, are marked The arc 7,\nrepresenting the head, is then marked The vertical lines 8, 9, 10, and\n11 are then marked, and the outline of the screw is complete The\nthick lines representing the bottom of the thread are next marked in,\nas in Figure 151, extending from line 9 to line 10 Midway between\nthese lines fine ones are made for the tops of the thread All the lines\nbeing pencilled in, they may be inked in with the drawing\ninstruments, taking care that they do not overrun one another When\nthe pencil lines are rubbed out, the sketch will appear as in Figure\n149 Fig 152 For a bolt with a hexagon head the lines would be drawn in the order\nshown in Figure 152 At a right-angle to centre line 1, line two is\ndrawn The pencil-compasses are then set to half the diameter of the\nbolt, and from point A arcs 3 and 6 are pencilled, thus showing the\nwidth of the front flat of the head, as well as the diameter of the stem From the point where these arcs meet line 2, and with the same\nradius, arcs 5 and 6 are marked, showing the widths of the other two\nflats of the head The thickness of the head and the length of the bolt\nhead may then be marked either by placing a rule on line 1 and\nmarking the short lines (such as line 7) a cross line 1, or the pencil-\ncompasses may be set to the rule and the lengths marked from point\nA In the United States standard for bolt heads and nuts the thickness\nof the head is made equal to the diameter of the bolt With the\ncompasses set for the arcs 3 and 4, we may in two steps, from A along\nthe centre line, mark off the thickness of the head without using the\nrule But as the rule has to be applied along line 1 to mark line 7 for\nthe length of the bolt, it is just as easy to mark the head thickness at\nthe same time The line 8 showing the length of the thread may be\nmarked at the same time as the other lengths are marked, and the\noutlines 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 may be drawn in the order named We have\nnow to mark the arcs at the top of the flats of the head to show the\nchamfer, and to explain how these arcs are obtained we have in\nFigure 153 an enlarged view of the head It is evident that the\nsmallest diameter of the chamfer is represented by the circle A, and\ntherefore the length of the line B must equal A It is also evident that\nthe outer edge of the chamfer will meet the corners at an equal depth\n(from the face of the nut), as represented by the line C C, and it is\nobvious that the curves that represent the outline of the chamfer on\neach side of the head or nut will approach the face of the head or nut\nat an equal distance, as denoted by the line D D It follows that the\ncurve must in each case be such as will, at each of its ends, meet the\nline C, and at its centre meet the line D D, the centres of the\nrespective curves being marked in the figure by X Fig 153 It is sufficiently accurate, therefore, for all practical purposes to set\nthe pencil on the centre-line at the point A in Figure 152 and mark\nthe curve 14, and to then set the compasses by trial to mark the other\ntwo curves of the chamfer, so that they shall be an equal distance\nwith arc 14 from line 9, and join lines 10 and 13 at the same distance\nfrom line 9 that 14 joins lines 3 and 4, so that as in Figure 153 all\nthree of the arcs would touch a line as C, and another line as D Fig 154 The United States standard sizes for forged or unfinished bolts and\nnuts are given in the following table, Figure 154 showing the\ndimensions referred to in the table UNITED STATES STANDARD DIMENSIONS OF BOLTS\nAND NUTS Bolt Bolt\nHead\nand\nNut Diameter Standard\nNumber\nof\nthreads\nper inch\nLong\ndiameter,\nI, or\ndiameter\nacross\ncorners\nShort\ndiameter\nof\nhexagon\nand\nsquare,\nor width\nacross J\nDepth of\nNut, H\nDepth\nof bolt\nhead, K\nNominal",

    "157 If we compare this head with similar views of a square head G, both\nbeing of equal widths, and having their chamfer circles at an equal\ndistance from the sides of the flats, and at the same angle, we perceive\nat once that the amount of chamfer necessary to give the same\n\n\ndistance between the chamfer circle and the side of the bolt (that is,\nthe distance from J to K, being equal to that from L to M), the length\nof the chamfer N for the square head so greatly exceeds the length A\nfor the hexagon head that the eye detects the difference at once, and\nis instinctively informed that G must be square, independently of the\nfact that in the case of the square head, N meets the arc O, while in\nthe hexagon head, A, which corresponds to N, does not meet the arc\nC, which corresponds to O When, however, the chamfer is drawn, but just sufficient to meet the\nflats, as in the case of the hexagon H, and the square I, in Figure 157,\nthe chamfer line passes from the chamfer circle to the side of the\nhead, and the distinction is greater, as will be seen by comparing head\nH with head I, both being of equal width, having the same angle of\nchamfer, and an amount just sufficient to meet the sides of the flats Here it will be seen that in the hexagon H, each side of the head, as P,\nmeets the chamfer circle A Whereas, in the square head these two\nlines are joined by the chamfer line Q, the figures being quite\ndissimilar Fig 158",
    "158 It is obvious that whatever the degree or angle of the chamfer may be,\nthe diameter of the chamfer circle will be the same in any view in\nwhich the head may be presented Thus, in Figure 158, the line G in\nthe side view is in length equal to the diameter of circle G, in the end\nview, and so long as the angle of the chamfer is forty-five degrees, as\nin all the views hitherto given, the width of the chamfer will be equal\nat corresponding points in the different views; thus in the figure the\nwidths A and B in the two views are equal Fig 159 If the other view showing a corner of the head in front of the head be\ngiven, the same fact holds good, as is shown in Figure 159 That the\ntwo outside flats should appear in the drawing to be half the width of\nthe middle flat is also shown in Figure 158, where D and E are each\nhalf the width of C Let us now suppose, that the chamfer be given\nsome other angle than that of 45 degrees, and we shall find that the\neffect is to alter the curves of the chamfer arcs on the flats, as is\nshown in Figure 160, where these arcs E, C, D are shown less curved,\n\n\nbecause the chamfer B has more angle to the flats As a result, the\nwidth or distance between the arcs and line G is different in the two\nviews On this account it is better to draw the chamfer at 45 degrees,\nas correct results may be obtained with the least trouble If no chamfer at all is to be given, a hexagon head may still be\ndistinguished from a square one, providing that the view giving three\nsides of the head, as in Figure 158, is shown, because the two sides D\nand E being half the width of the middle one C, imparts the\ninformation that it is a hexagon head If, however, the view showing\nbut two of the sides and a corner in front is given, and no chamfer is\nused, it could not be known whether the head was to be hexagon or\nsquare, unless an end view be given, as in Figure 161 Fig 160 If the view showing a full side of the head of a square-headed bolt is\ngiven, then either an end view must be given, as in Figure 162, or else\na single view with a cross on its head, as in Figure 163, may be given It is the better plan, both in square and hexagon heads, to give the\nview in which the full face of a flat is presented, that is, as in Figures\n155 and 163; because, in the case of the square, the length of a side\nand the width across the head are both given in that view; whereas if\ntwo sides are shown, as in Figure 161, the width across flats is not\ngiven, and this is the dimension that is wanted to work to, and not the\nwidth across corners In the case of a hexagon the middle of the three\nflats is equal in width to the diameter of the bolt, and the other two\nare one-half its width; all three, therefore, being marked with the\nsame set of compasses as gives the diameter of the body of the bolt,\nwere as shown in Figure 152 For the width across flats there is an\naccepted standard; hence there is no need to mark it upon the\ndrawing, unless in cases where the standard is to be departed from, in\nwhich event an end view may be added, or the view showing two\nsides may be given Fig 161 Fig 162 Fig 163 Fig 164 To draw a square-headed bolt, the pencil lines are marked in the\norder shown by figures in Figure 164 The inking in is done in the\norder of the letters a, b, c, etc It will be observed that pencil lines 2,\n9, and 10 are not drawn to cross, but only to meet the lines at their\nends, a point that, as before stated, should always be carefully\nattended to Fig 165\nTo draw the end view of a hexagon head, first draw a circle of the\ndiameter across the flats, and then rest the triangle of 60 degrees on\nthe blade s of the square, as at T 1, in Figure 165, and mark the lines\na and b Reverse the triangle, as at T 2, and draw lines c and d Then\nplace the triangle as in Figure 166, and draw the lines e and f Fig 166 If the other view of the head is to be drawn, then first draw the lines a\nand b in Figure 167 with the square, then with the 60 degree triangle,\nplaced on the square S, as at T 1, draw the lines c, d, and turning the\nsquare over, as at T 2, mark lines e and f Fig 167 If the diameter across corners of a square head is given, and it be\nrequired to draw the head, the process is as follows: For a view\nshowing one corner in front, as in Figure 168, a circle of the given\ndiameter across corners is pencilled, and the horizontal centre-line a is\nmarked, and the triangle of 45 degrees is rested against the square\nblade S, as in position T 1, and lines b and c marked, b being marked\nfirst; and the triangle is then slid along the square blade to position T\n1, when line c is marked, these two lines just meeting the horizontal\nline a, where it meets the circle The triangle is then moved to the left,\nand line d, joining the ends of b and c, is marked, and by moving it\nstill farther to the left to position T 2, line e is marked Lines b, c, d,\nand e are, of course, the only ones inked in Fig 168 Fig 169 If the flats are to lie in the other direction, the pencilling will be done\nas in Figure 169 The circle is marked as before, and with the triangle\nplaced as shown at T 1, line a, passing through the centre of the\ncircle, is drawn By moving the triangle to the right its edge B will be\nbrought into position to mark line b, also passing through the centre\nof the circle All that remains is to join the ends of these two lines,\nusing the square blade for lines c, d, and the triangle for e and f, its\nposition on the square blade being denoted at T 3; lines c, d, e, f, are\nthe ones inked in Fig 170 For a hexagon head we have the processes, Figures 170 and 171 The\ncircle is struck, and across it line a, Figure 170, passing through its\ncentre, the triangle of sixty degrees will mark the sides b, c, and d, e,\nas shown, and the square blade is used for f, g Fig 171 The chamfer circles are left out of these figures to reduce the number\nof lines and so keep the engraving clear Figure 171 shows the method\nof drawing a hexagon head when the diameter across corners is given,\nthe lines being drawn in the alphabetical order marked, and the\ntriangle used as will now be understood Fig 172 Fig 173",
    "173 It may now be pointed out that the triangle may be used to divide\ncircles much more quickly than they could be divided by stepping\naround them with compasses Suppose, for example, that we require\nto divide a circle into eight equal parts, and we may do so as in Figure\n172, line a being marked from the square, and lines b, c and d from\nthe triangle of forty-five degrees; the lines to be inked in to form an\noctagon need not be pencilled, as their location is clearly defined,\nbeing lines joining the ends of the lines crossing the circle, as for\nexample, lines e, f Let it be required to draw a polygon having twelve equal sides, and\n\n\nthe triangle of sixty is used, marking all the lines within the circle in\nFigure 173, except a, for which the square blade is used; the only lines\nto be inked in are such as b, c In this example there is a corner at the\ntop and bottom, but suppose it were required that a flat should fall\nthere instead of a corner; then all we have to do is to set the square\nblade S at the required angle, as in Figure 174, and then proceed as\nbefore, bearing in mind that the point of the circle nearest to the\nsquare blade, straight-edge, or whatever the triangle is rested on, is\nalways a corner of a polygon having twelve sides Fig 174 Fig 175 175 In both of these examples we have assumed that the diameter across\ncorners of the polygon was given, but suppose the diameter across the\nflats were given, and the construction is a little more complicated Circle a, a, in Figure 175, is drawn of the required diameter across the\nflats, and the lines of division are drawn across with the triangle of 60\nas before; the triangle of 45 is then used to draw the four lines, b, c, d,\ne, joining the ends of lines i, j, k, l, and touching the inner circle, a, a The outer circle is then pencilled in, touching the lines of division\nwhere they meet the lines b, c, d, e, and the rest of the lines for the\nsides of the polygon may then be drawn within the outer circle, as at\ng, h Fig 176 It is obvious, also, that the triangle may be used to draw slots\nradiating from a centre, as in Figure 176, where it is desired to draw a\nchuck-plate having 6 slots The triangle of 60 is used to draw the\ncentre lines, a, b, c, etc , for the slots From the centre, the arcs e, f, g,\nh, etc , are marked, showing where the centres will fall for describing\nthe half circles forming the ends of the slots Then half circles, i, j, k, l,\netc , being drawn, the sides of the slots may be drawn in with the\ntriangle, and the outer circle and the slots inked in If the slots are not to radiate from the centre of the circle the process\nis as follows:\nThe outer circle a, Figure 177, being drawn, an inner one b is drawn,\nits radius equalling the amount; the centres of the slots are to point to\n\n\none side of the centre of circle a The triangle is then used to divide\nthe circle into the requisite number of divisions c for the slots, and\narcs i, j, are then drawn for the lengths of the slots The centre lines e\nare then drawn, passing through the lines c, and the arcs i, j, etc , and\ntouching the perimeter of the inner circle b; arcs f, g, are then marked\nin, and their sides joined with the triangle adjusted by hand All that\nwould be inked in black are the outer circle and the slots, but the\ninner circle b and a centre line of one of the slots should be marked in\nred ink to show how the inclination of the slot was obtained, and\ntherefore its amount Fig 177 For a five-sided figure it is best to step around the circumference of\nthe circle with the compasses, but for a three-sided one, or trigon, the\nconstruction is as follows: It will be found that the compasses set to\nthe radius of a circle will accurately divide it into six equal divisions,\nas is shown in Figure 178; hence every other one of these divisions\nwill be the location for a corner of a trigon The circle being drawn, a line A, 179, is drawn through its centre, and\nfrom its intersection with the circle as at b, here a step on each side is\nmarked as c, d, then lines c to d, and c and d to e, where A meets, the\ncircle will describe a trigon If the figure is to stand vertical, all that is\nnecessary is to draw the line a vertical, as in Figure 180 A ready\nmethod of getting the dimension across corners, across the flats, or\nthe length of a side of a given polygon, is by means of diagrams, such\nas shown in the following figures, which form excellent examples for\npractice Fig 178 Fig 179 Fig 180 Draw the line O P, Figure 181, and at a right angle to it the line O B;\ndivide these two lines into parts of one inch, as shown in the cut,\nwhich is divided into inches and quarter inches, and from these points\nof division draw lines crossing each other as shown Fig 181 From the point O, draw diagonal lines, at suitable angles to the line O\nP As shown in the cut, these diagonal lines are marked:\n40\ndegrees for 5 sided figures 45\n\"\n\"\n6\n\"\n\"\n49\n\"\n\"\n7\n\"\n\"\n52-1/2\n\"\n\"\n8\n\"\n\"\n55-1/2\n\"\n\"\n9\n\"\n\"\nBut still others could be added for figures having a greater number of\nsides 1 Now it will be found as follows: Half the diameter, or the radius of\na piece of cylindrical work being given, and the number of sides it is\nto have being stated, the length of one side will be the distance\nmeasured horizontally from the line O B to the diagonal line for that\nparticular number of sides Example —A piece of work is 2-1/2 inches in diameter, and is\nrequired to have 9 sides: what will be the length of the sides or flats Now the half diameter or radius of 2-1/2 inches is 1-1/4 inches Then\nlook along the line O B for 1-1/4, which is denoted in the cut by\nfigures and the arrow A; set one point of the compasses at A, and the\nother at the point of crossing of the diagonal line with the 1-1/4\nhorizontal line, as shown in the figure at a, and from A to a is the\nlength of one side Again: A piece of work, 4 inches in diameter, is to have 9 sides: how\nlong will each side be Now half of 4 is 2, hence from B to b is the length of each side But suppose that from the length of each side, and the number of\nsides, it is required to find the diameter to which to turn the piece;\nthat is, its diameter across corners, and we simply reverse the process\nthus: A body has 9 sides, each side measures 27/32: what is its\ndiameter across corners Take a rule, apply it horizontally on the figure, and pass it along till\n\n\nthe distance from the line O B to the diagonal line marked 9 sides\nmeasures 27/32, which is from 1-1/4 on O B to a, and the 1-1/4 is the\nradius, which, multiplied by 2, gives 2-1/2 inches, which is the\nrequired diameter across corners For any other number of sides the process is just the same Thus: A\nbody is 3-1/2 inches in diameter, and is to have 5 sides: what will be\nthe length of each side Now half of 3-1/2 is 1-3/4; hence from 1-3/4\non the line O B to the point C, where the diagonal line crosses the\n1-3/4 line, is the length of each of the sides 2 It will be found that the length of a side of a square being given,\nthe size of the square, measured across corners, will be the length of\nthe diagonal line marked 45 degrees, from the point O to the figures\nindicating, on the line O B or on the line O P, the length of one side Example —A square body measures 1 inch on each side: what does it\nmeasure across the corners Answer: From the point O, along\ndiagonal line marked 45 degrees, to the point where it crosses the\nlines 1 (as denoted in the figure by a dot) Again: A cylindrical piece of wood requires to be squared, and each\nside of the square must measure an inch: what diameter must the\npiece be turned to Now the diagonal line marked 45 degrees passes through the 1-inch\nline on O B, and the inch line on O P, at the point where these lines\nmeet; hence all we have to do is to run the eye along either of the\nlines marked inch, and from its point of meeting the 45 degrees line,\nto the point O, is the diameter to turn the piece to There is another way, however, of getting this same measurement,\nwhich is to set a pair of compasses from the line 1 on O B, to line 1 on\nO P, as shown by the line D, which is the full diameter across corners This is apparent, because from point O, along line O B, to 1, thence to\nthe dot, thence down to line 1 on O P, and along that to O, encloses a\nsquare, of which either from O to the dot, or the length of the line D,\nis the measurement across corners, while the length of each side, or\ndiameter across the flats, is from point O to either of the points 1, or\nfrom either of the points 1 to the dot Fig 182 After graphically demonstrating the correctness of the scale we may\nsimplify it considerably In Figure 182, therefore, we have\napplications shown A is a hexagon, and if one of its sides be\nmeasured, it will be found that it measures the same as along line 1\nfrom O B to the diagonal line 45 degrees, which distance is shown by\na thickened line At 1-1/2 is shown a seven-sided figure, whose diameter is 3 inches,\nand radius 1-1/2 inches, and if from the point at 1-1/2 (along the\nthickened horizontal line), to the diagonal marked 49 degrees, be\nmeasured, it will be found exactly equal to the length of a side on the\npolygon At C is shown part of a nine-sided polygon, of 2-inch radius, and the\nlength of one of its sides will be found to equal the distance from the\ndiagonal line marked 52-1/2 degrees, and the line O B at 2 Let it now be noted that if from the point O, as a centre, we describe\narcs of circles from the points of division on O B to O P, one end of\neach arc will meet the same figure on O P as it started from at O B, as\nis shown in Figure 181, and it becomes apparent that in the length of\ndiagonal line between O and the required arc we have the radius of\nthe polygon",
    "Let it now be noted that if from the point O, as a centre, we describe\narcs of circles from the points of division on O B to O P, one end of\neach arc will meet the same figure on O P as it started from at O B, as\nis shown in Figure 181, and it becomes apparent that in the length of\ndiagonal line between O and the required arc we have the radius of\nthe polygon Example —What is the radius across corners of a hexagon or six-\nsided figure, the length of a side being an inch Turning to our scale we find that the place where there is a horizontal\ndistance of an inch between the diagonal 45 degrees, answering to six-\nsided figures, is along line 1 (Figure 182), and the radius of the circle\nenclosing the six-sided body is, therefore, an inch, as will be seen on\nreferring to circle A But it will be noted that the length of diagonal\nline 45 degrees, enclosed between the point O and the arc of circle\nfrom 1 on O B to one on O P, measures also an inch Hence we may\nmeasure the radius along the diagonal lines if we choose This,\nhowever, simply serves to demonstrate the correctness of the scale,\nwhich, being understood, we may dispense with most of the lines,\narriving at a scale such as shown in Figure 183, in which the length of\nthe side of the polygon is the distance from the line O B, measured\n\n\nhorizontally to the diagonal, corresponding to the number of sides of\nthe polygon The radius across corners of the polygon is that of the\ndistance from O along O B to the horizontal line, giving the length of\nthe side of the polygon, and the width across corners for a given\nlength of one side of the square, is measured by the length of the lines\nA, B, C, etc Thus, dotted line 2 shows the length of the side of a nine-\nsided figure, of 2-inch radius, the radius across corners of the figure\nbeing 2 inches Fig 183 The dotted line 2-1/2 shows the length of the side of a nine-sided\npolygon, having a radius across corners of 2-1/2 inches The dotted\nline 1 shows the diameter, across corners, of a square whose sides\nmeasure an inch, and so on Fig 184 This scale lacks, however, one element, in that the diameter across the\nflats of a regular polygon being given, it will not give the diameter\nacross the corners This, however, we may obtain by a somewhat\nsimilar construction Thus, in Figure 184, draw the line O B, and\ndivide it into inches and parts of an inch From these points of\ndivision draw horizontal lines; from the point O draw the following\nlines and at the following angles from the horizontal line O P Fig 185 A line at 75° for polygons having 12 sides \"    72°        \"      \"    10  \"\n\"    67-1/2°    \"      \"    8  \"\n\"    60°        \"      \"    6  \"\nFrom the point O to the numerals denoting the radius of the polygon\nis the radius across the flats, while from point O to the horizontal line\ndrawn from those numerals is the radius across corners of the\npolygon Fig 186 A hexagon measures two inches across the flats: what is its diameter\nmeasured across the corners Now from point O to the horizontal line\nmarked 1 inch, measured along the line of 60 degrees, is 1 5-32nds\ninches: hence the hexagon measures twice that, or 2 5-16ths inches\nacross corners The proof of the construction is shown in the figure,\nthe hexagon and other polygons being marked simply for clearness of\nillustration Fig 187 Fig 188 Let it be required to draw the stud shown in Figure 185, and the\nconstruction would be, for the pencil lines, as shown in Figure 186;\nline 1 is the centre line, arcs, 2 and 3 give the large, and arcs 4 and 5\nthe small diameter, to touch which lines 6, 7, 8, and 9 may be drawn Lines 10, 11, and 12 are then drawn for the lengths, and it remains to\ndraw the curves in In drawing these curves great exactitude is\nrequired to properly find their centres; nothing looks worse in a\ndrawing than an unfair or uneven junction between curves and\nstraight lines To find the location for these centres, set the compasses\nto the required radius for the curve, and from the point or corner A\ndraw the arcs b and c, from c mark the arc e, and from b the arc d, and\nwhere d and e cross is the centre for the curve f Fig 189 Similarly for the curve h, set the compasses on i and mark the arc g,\nand from the point where it crosses line 6, draw the curve h In inking\nin it is best to draw in all curves or arcs of circles first, and the\nstraight lines that join them afterward, because, if the straight lines\nare drawn first, it is a difficult matter to alter the centres of the curves\nto make them fall true, whereas, after the curves are drawn it is an\neasy matter, if it should be necessary, to vary the line a trifle, so as to\nmake it join the curves correctly and fair In inking in these curves\nalso, care must be taken not to draw them too short or too long, as\nthis would impair the appearance very much, as is shown in Figure\n187 Fig 190 Fig 191 To draw the piece shown in Figure 188, the lines are drawn in the\norder indicated by the letters in Figure 189, the example being given\nfor practice It is well for the beginner to draw examples of common\nobjects, such as the hand hammer in Figure 190, or the chuck plate in\nFigure 191, which afford good examples in the drawing of arcs and\ncircles In Figure 191 a is a cap nut, and the order in which the same would\nbe pencilled in is indicated by the respective numerals The circles 3\nand 4 represent the thread Fig 191 a In Figure 192 is shown the pencilling for a link having the hubs on\none side only, so that a centre line is unnecessary on the edge view, as\nall the lengths are derived from the top view, while the thickness of\nthe stem and height of the hubs may be measured from the line A In\nFigure 193 there are hubs (on both sides of the link) of unequal\nheight, hence a centre line is necessary in both views, and from this\nline all measurements should be marked Fig 192 Fig 193 In Figure 194 are represented the pencil lines for a double eye or\nknuckle joint, as it is sometimes termed, an example that it is\ndesirable for the student to draw in various sizes, as it is\nrepresentative of a large class of work These eyes often have an offset, and an example of this is given in\nFigure 195, in which A is the centre line for the stem distant from the\ncentre line B of the eyes to the amount of offset required Fig 194 Fig 195 Fig 196 Fig 197 In Figure 196 is an example of a connecting rod end From a point, as\nA, we draw arcs, as B C for the width, and E D for the length of the\nblock, and through A we draw the centre line It is obvious, however,\nthat we may draw the centre line first, and apply the measuring rule\ndirect to the paper, and mark lines in place of the arcs B, C, D, E, and\nF, G, which are for the stem As the block joins the stem in a straight\nline, the latter is evidently rectangular, as will be seen by referring to\nFigure 197, which represents a rod end with a round stem, the fact\nthat the stem is round being clearly shown by the curves A B The\nradius of these curves is obtained as follows: It is obvious that they\nwill join the rod stem at the same point as the shoulder curves do, as\ndenoted by the dotted vertical line So likewise they join the curves E\nF at the same point in the rod length as the shoulder curves, both\ncurves in fact being formed by the same round corner or shoulder The centre of the radius of A or B must therefore be the same distance\nfrom the centre of the rod as is the centre from which the shoulder\ncurve is struck, and at the same time at such a distance from the\ncorner (as E or F) that the curve will meet the centre line of the rod at\nthe same point in its length as the shoulder curves do Fig 198 Figure 198 gives an example, in which the similar curved lines show\nthat a part is square The figure represents a bolt with a square under\nthe head As but one view is given, that fact alone tells us that it must\nbe round or square Now we might mark a cross on the square part, to\ndenote that it is square; but this is unnecessary, because the curves F\nG show such to be the case These curves are marked as follows: With\nthe compasses set to the radius E, one point is rested at A, and arc B is\ndrawn; then one point of the compass is rested at C, and arc D is\ndrawn; giving the centre for the curve F by a similar process on the\nother side of the figure, curve G is drawn Point C is obtained by\ndrawing the dotted line across where the outline curve meets the\nstem Suppose that the corner where the round stem meets the square\nunder the head was a sharp one instead of a curve, then the\ntraditional cross would require to be put on the square, as in Figure\n199; or the cross will be necessary if the corner be a round one, if the\n\n\nstem is reduced in diameter, as in Figure 200 Fig 199 Fig 200 Fig 201 Figure 201 represents a centre punch, giving an example, in which the\nflat sides gradually run out upon a circle, the edges forming curves, as\nat A, B, etc The length of these curves is determined as follows: They\nmust begin where the taper of the punch joins the parallel, or at C, C,\nand they must end on that part of the taper stem where the diameter\nis equal to the diameter across the flats of the octagon All that is to\nbe done then is to find the diameter across the flats on the end view,\nand mark it on the taper stem, as at D, D, which will show where the\nflats terminate on the taper stem And the curved lines, as A, B, may\nbe drawn in by a curve that must meet at the line C, and also in a\nrounded point at line D CHAPTER VIII SCREW THREADS AND SPIRALS Fig 202 Fig 203",
    "203 The screw thread for small bolts is represented by thick and thin lines,\nsuch as was shown in Figure 152, but in larger sizes; the angles of the\nthread also are drawn in, as in Figure 202, and the method of doing\nthis is shown in Figure 203 The centre line 1 and lines 2 and 3 for the\nfull diameter of the thread being drawn, set the compasses to the\nrequired pitch of the thread, and stepping along line 2, mark the arcs\n4, 5, 6, etc , for the full length the thread is to be marked With the\ntriangle resting against the T-square, the lines 7, 8, 9, etc (for the full\nlength of the thread), are drawn from the points 4, 5, 6, on line 2 These give one side of the thread Reversing the drawing triangle,\nangles 10, 11, etc , are then drawn, which will complete the outline of\nthe thread at the top of the bolt We may now mark the depth of the\nthread by drawing line 12, and with the compasses set on the centre\nline transfer this depth to the other side of the bolt, as denoted by the\narcs 13 and 14 Touching arc 14 we mark line 15 for the thread depth\non that side We have now to get the slant of the thread across the\nbolt It is obvious that in passing once around the bolt the thread\nadvances to the amount of the pitch as from a to b; hence, in passing\nhalf way around, it will advance from a to c; we therefore draw line\n16 at a right-angle to the centre line, and a line that touches the top of\nthe threads at a, where it meets line 2, and also meets line 16, where\nit touches line 3, is the angle or slope for the tops of the threads,\nwhich may be drawn across by lines, as 18, 19, 20, etc From these\nlines the sides of the thread may be drawn at the bottom of the bolt,\nmarking first the angle on one side, as by lines 21, 22, 23, etc , and\nthen the angles on the other, as by lines 24, 25, etc Fig 204 There now remain the bottoms of the thread to draw, and this is done\nby drawing lines from the bottom of the thread on one side of the bolt\n\n\nto the bottom on the other, as shown in the cut by a dotted line;\nhence, we may set a square blade to that angle, and mark in these\nlines, as 26, 27, 28, etc , and the thread is pencilled in complete If the student will follow out this example upon paper, it will appear\nto him that after the thread had been marked out on one side of the\nbolt, the angle of the thread might be obtained, as shown by lines 16\nand 17, and that the bottoms of the thread as well as the tops might\nbe carried across the bolt to the other side Figure 204 represents a\ncase in which this has been done, and it will be observed that the\nlines denoting the bottom of the thread do not meet the bottoms of\nthe thread, which occurs for the reason that the angle for the bottom\nis not the same as that for the top of the thread Fig 205 Fig 206",
    "206 In inking in the thread, it enhances the appearance to give the bottom\nof the thread and the right-hand side of the same, heavy shade lines,\nas in Figure 202, a plan that is usually adopted for threads of large\ndiameter and coarse pitch A double thread, such as in Figure 205, is drawn in the same way,\nexcept that the slant of the thread is doubled, and the square is to be\nset for the thread-pitch A, A, both for the tops and bottoms of the\nthread Fig 207 A round top and bottom thread, as the Whitworth thread, is drawn by\nsingle lines, as in Figure 206 A left-hand thread, Figure 207, is\nobviously drawn by the same process as a right-hand one, except that\nthe slant of the thread is given in the opposite direction For screw threads of a large diameter it is not uncommon to draw in\nthe thread curves as they appear to the eye, and the method of doing\nthis is shown in Figure 208 The thread is first marked on both sides\nof the bolt, as explained, and instead of drawing, straight across the\nbolt, lines to represent the tops and bottoms of the thread, a template\nto draw the curves by is required To get these curves, two half-\ncircles, one equal in diameter to the top, and one equal to the bottom\n\n\nof the thread, are drawn, as in Figure 208 Fig 208 These half-circles are divided into any convenient number of equal\ndivisions: thus in Figure 208, each has eight divisions, as a, b, c, etc ,\nfor the outer, and i, j, k, etc , for the inner one The pitch of the thread\nis then divided off by vertical lines into as many equal divisions as the\nhalf-circles are divided into, as by the lines a, b, c, etc",
    "The pitch of the thread\nis then divided off by vertical lines into as many equal divisions as the\nhalf-circles are divided into, as by the lines a, b, c, etc , to o Of these,\nthe seven from a, to h, correspond to the seven from a' to g', and are\nfor the top of the thread, and the seven from i to o correspond to the\nseven on the inner half-circle, as i, j, k, etc Horizontal lines are then\ndrawn from the points of the division to meet the vertical lines of\ndivision; thus the horizontal dotted line from a' meets the vertical line\na, and where they meet, as at A, a dot is made Where the dotted line\nfrom b' meets vertical line b, another dot is made, as at B, and so on\nuntil the point G is found A curve drawn to pass from the top of the\nthread on one side of the bolt to the top of the other side, and passing\nthrough these points, as from A to G, will be the curve for the top of\nthe thread, and from this curve a template may be made to mark all\nthe other thread-tops from, because manifestly all the tops of the\nthread on the bolt will be alike For the bottoms of the thread, lines are similarly drawn, as from i' to\nmeet i, where dot I is marked J is got from j' and j, while K is got\nfrom the intersection of k' with k, and so on, the dots from I to O\nbeing those through which a curve is drawn for the bottom of the\nthread, and from this curve a template also may be made to mark all\nthe thread bottoms We have in our example used eight points of\ndivision in each half-circle, but either more or less points maybe used,\nthe only requisite being that the pitch of the thread must be divided\ninto as many divisions as the two half-circles are But it is not\nabsolutely necessary that both half-circles be divided into the same\nnumber of equal divisions Thus, suppose the large half-circle were\ndivided into ten divisions, then instead of the first half of the pitch\nbeing divided into eight (as from a to h) it would require to have ten\nlines But the inner half-circle may have eight only, as in our example It is more convenient, however, to use the same number of divisions\nfor both circles, so that they may both be divided together by lines\n\n\nradiating from the centre The more the points of division, the greater\nnumber of points to draw the curves through; hence it is desirable to\nhave as many as possible, which is governed by the pitch of the\nthread, it being obvious that the finer the pitch the less the number of\ndistinct and clear divisions it is practicable to divide it into In our\nexample the angles of the thread are spread out to cause these lines to\nbe thrown further apart than they would be in a bolt of that diameter;\nhence it will be seen that in threads of but two or three inches in\ndiameter the lines would fall very close together, and would require\nto be drawn finely and with care to keep them distinct",
    "In our\nexample the angles of the thread are spread out to cause these lines to\nbe thrown further apart than they would be in a bolt of that diameter;\nhence it will be seen that in threads of but two or three inches in\ndiameter the lines would fall very close together, and would require\nto be drawn finely and with care to keep them distinct Fig 208 a Fig 209 The curves for a United States standard form of thread are obtained in\nthe same manner as from the V thread in Figure 208, but the thread\nitself is more difficult to draw The construction of this thread is\nshown in Figure 208, it having a flat place at the top and at the\nbottom of the thread A common V thread has its sides at an angle of\n60 degrees, one to the other, the top and bottom meeting in a point The United States standard is obtained from drawing a common V\nthread and dividing its depth into eight equal divisions, as at x, in\nFigure 208 a, and cutting off one of these divisions at the top and\nfilling in one at the bottom to form flat places, as shown in the figure But the thread cannot be sketched on a bolt by this means unless\ntemporary lines are used to get the thread from, these temporary lines\nbeing drawn to represent a bolt one-fourth the depth of the thread too\nlarge in diameter Thus, in Figure 208 a, it is seen that cutting off one-\neighth the depth of the thread reduces the diameter of the thread It is\nnecessary, then, to draw the flat place on top of the thread first, the\norder of procedure being shown in Figure 209 The lines for the full\ndiameter of the thread being drawn, the pitch is stepped off by arcs,\nas 1, 2, 3, etc ; and from these, arcs, as 4, 5, 6, etc , are marked for the\nwidth of the flat places at the tops of the threads Then one side of the\nthread is marked off by lines, as 7, which meet the arcs 1, 2, 3, etc , as\nat a, c, etc Similar lines, as 8 and 9, are marked for the other side of\nthe thread, these lines, 7, 8 and 9, projecting until they cross each\nother Line 10 is then drawn, making a flat place at the bottom of the\nthread equal in width to that at the top Line 12 is then drawn square\n\n\nacross the bolt, starting from the bottom of the thread, and line 13 is\ndrawn starting from the corner f on one side of the thread and\nmeeting line 12 on the other side of the thread, which gives the angle\nfor the tops of the thread The depth of the thread may then be\nmarked on the other side of the bolt by the arcs d and e, and the line\n14 The tops of all the threads may then be drawn in, as by lines 15,\n16, 17 and 18, and by lines, as 19, etc , the thread sides may be\ndrawn on the other side of the bolt All that remains is to join the\nbottoms of the threads by lines across the bolt, and the pencil lines\nwill be complete, ready to ink in If the thread is to be shown curved\ninstead of drawn straight across, the curve may be obtained by the\nconstruction in Figure 208, which is similar to that in Figure 207,\nexcept that while the pitch is divided off into 16 divisions, the whole\nof these 16 divisions are not used to get the curves, some of them\nbeing used twice over; thus for the bottom the eight divisions from b\nto i are used, while for the tops the eight from g to o are used Hence\ng, h and i are used for getting both curves, the divisions from a to b\nand from o to p being taken up by the flat top and bottom of the\nthread It will be noted that in Figure 207, the top of the thread is\ndrawn first, while in Figure 208 the bottom is drawn first, and that in\nthe latter (for the U S standard) the pitch is marked from centre to\ncentre of the flats of the thread Fig 210 To draw a square thread the pencil lines are marked in the order\nshown in Figure 210, in which 1 represents the centre line and 2, 3, 4\nand 5, the diameter and depth of the thread The pitch of the thread is\nmarked off by arcs, as 6, 7, etc , or by laying a rule directly on the\ncentre line and marking with a lead pencil To obtain the slant of the\nthread, lines 8 and 9 are drawn, and from these line 10, touching 8\nand 9 where they meet lines 2 and 5; the threads may then be drawn\nin from the arcs as 6, 7, etc The side of the thread will show at the\ntop and the bottom as at A B, because of the coarse pitch and the\nthread on the other or unseen side of the bolt slants, as denoted by the\nlines 12, 13; and hence to draw the sides A B, the triangle must be set\nfrom one thread to the next on the opposite side of the bolt, as\ndenoted by the dotted lines 12 and 13 Fig 211 If the curves of the thread are to be drawn in, they may be obtained\nas in Figure 211, which is substantially the same as described for a V\nthread The curves f, representing the sides of the thread, terminate at\nthe centre line g, and the curves e are equidistant with the curves c\nfrom the vertical lines d As the curves f above the line are the same\nas f below the line, the template for f need not be made to extend the\nwhole distance across, but one-half only; as is shown by the dotted\ncurve g, in the construction for finding the curve for square-threaded\nnuts in Figure 212 Fig 212 Fig 213 A specimen of the form of template for drawing these curves is shown\nin Figure 213; g g, is the centre line parallel to the edges R, S; lines m,\nn, represent the diameter of the thread at the top, and o, p, that at the\nbottom or root; edge a is formed to the points (found by the\nconstructions in the figures as already explained) for the tops of the\nthread, and edge f is so formed for the curve at the thread bottoms The edge, as S or R, is laid against the square-blade to steady it while\ndrawing in the curves It may be noted, however, that since the curve\nis the same below the centre line as it is above, the template may be\nmade to serve for one-half the thread diameter, as at f, where it is\nmade from o to g, only being turned upside down to draw the other\nhalf of the curve; the notches cut out at x, x, are merely to let the\npencil-lines in the drawing show plainly when setting the template When the thread of a nut is shown in section, it slants in the opposite\ndirection to that which appears on the bolt-thread, because it shows\nthe thread that fits to the opposite side of the bolt, which, therefore,\nslants in the opposite direction, as shown by the lines 12 and 13 in\nFigure 210 In a top or end view of a nut the thread depth is usually shown by a\nsimple circle, as in Figure 214 Fig 214",
    "214 To draw a spiral spring, draw the centre line A, and lines B, C, Figure\n215, distant apart the diameter the spring is to be less the diameter of\nthe wire of which it is to be made On the centre line A mark two\nlines a b, c d, representing the pitch of the spring Divide the distance\nbetween a and b into four equal divisions, as by lines 1, 2, 3, letting\nline 3 meet line B Line e meeting the centre line at line a, and the line\nB at its intersection with line 3, is the angle of the coil on one side of\nthe spring; hence it may be marked in at all the locations, as at e f,\netc These lines give at their intersections with the lines C and B the\ncentres for the half circles g, which being drawn, the sides h, i, j, k,\netc , of the spring, may all be marked in By the lines m, n, o, p, the\nother sides of the spring may be marked in Fig 215 215 The end of the spring is usually marked straight across, as at L If it is\nrequired to draw the coils curved instead of straight across, a template\nmust be made, the curve being obtained as already described for\nthreads It may be pointed out, however, that to obtain as accurate a\ndivision as possible of the lines that divide the pitch, the pitch may be\ndivided upon a diagonal line, as F, Figure 216, which will greatly\nfacilitate the operation Fig 216",
    "216 Before going into projections it may be as well to give some examples\nfor practice CHAPTER IX EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE Figure 217 represents a simple example for practice, which the\nstudent may draw the size of the engraving, or he may draw it twice\nthe size Figure 217 represents a simple example for practice, which the\nstudent may draw the size of the engraving, or he may draw it twice\nthe size It is a locomotive spring, composed of leaves or plates, held\ntogether by a central band Fig 217 Figure 218 is an example of a stuffing box and gland, supposed to\nstand vertical, hence the gland has an oil cup or receptacle Fig 218 In Figure 219 are working drawings of a coupling rod, with the\ndimensions and directions marked in It may be remarked, however, that the drawings of a workshop are,\nwhere large quantities of the same kind of work is done, varied in\ncharacter to suit some special departments—that is to say, special\nextra drawings are made for these departments In Figures 220 and\n221 is a drawing of a connecting rod drawn, put together as it would\nbe for the lathe, vise or erecting shop Fig 219 (Page 169 )\nFig 220 Fig 221 Fig 222 To the two views shown there would be necessary detail sketches of\nthe set screws, gibbs, and keys, all the rest being shown; the necessary\ndimensions being, of course, marked on the general drawing and on\nthe details In so simple a thing as a connecting rod, however, there would be no\nquestion as to how the parts go together; hence detail drawings of\neach separate piece would answer for the lathe or vise bands But in many cases this would not be the case, and the drawing would\nrequire to show the parts put together, and be accompanied with such\ndetail sketches as might be necessary to show parts that could not be\nclearly defined in the general views The blacksmith, for example, is only concerned with the making of\nthe separate pieces, and has no concern as to how the parts go\ntogether Furthermore, there are parts and dimensions in the general\ndrawing with which the blacksmith has nothing to do Thus the location and dimensions of the keyways, the dimensions of\nthe brasses, and the location of the bolt holes, are matters that have\nno reference to the blacksmith's work, because the keyways, bolt\nholes, and set-screw holes would be cut out of the solid in the\nmachine shop It is customary, therefore, to send to the blacksmith\nshop drawings containing separate views of each piece drawn to the\nshape it is to be forged; and drawn full size, or else on a scale\nsufficiently large to make each part show clearly without close\ninspection, marking thereon the full sizes, and stating beneath the\nnumber of pieces of each detail (As in Figure 222, which represents\nthe iron work of the connecting rod in Figure 220) In some cases the\nfinished sizes are marked, and it is left to the blacksmith's judgment\nhow much to leave for the finishing This is undesirable, because\neither the blacksmith is left to judge what parts are to be finished, or\n\n\nelse there must be on the drawing instructions on this point, or else\nsigns or symbols that are understood to convey the information It is\nbetter, therefore, to make for the blacksmith a special sketch, and\nmark thereon the full-forged sizes, stating on the drawing that such is\nthe case Fig",
    "Fig 223\nAs to the material of which the pieces are to be made, the greater part\nof blacksmith work is made of wrought iron, and it is, therefore,\nunnecessary to write \"wrought iron\" beneath each piece When the\npieces are to be of steel, however, it should be marked on the drawing\nand beneath the piece In special cases, as where the greater part of\nthe work of the shop is of steel, the rule may, of course, be reversed,\nand the parts made of iron may be the ones marked, whereas when\nparts are sometimes of iron, and at others of steel, each piece should\nbe marked As a general rule the blacksmith knows, from the custom of the shop\nor the nature of the work, what the quality or kind of iron is to be,\nand it is, therefore, only in exceptional cases that they need to be\nmentioned on the drawing Thus in a carriage manufactory, Norway\nor Swede iron will be found, as well as the better grades of refined\niron, but the blacksmith will know what iron to use, for certain parts,\nor the shop may be so regulated that the selection of the iron is not\nleft to him In marking the number of pieces required, it is better to\nuse the word \"thus\" than the words \"of this,\" or \"off this,\" because it is\nshorter and more correct, for the forging is not taken off the drawing,\nnor is it of the same; the drawing gives the shape and the size, and the\nword \"thus\" conveys that idea better than \"of,\" \"off,\" or \"like this \"\nIn shops where there are many of the same pieces forged, the\nblacksmith is furnished with sheet-iron templates that he can lay\ndirectly upon the forging and test its dimensions at once, which is an\nexcellent plan in large work Such templates are, of course, made from\nthe drawings, and it becomes a question as to whether their\ndimensions should be the forged or the finished ones If they are the\nforged, they may cause trouble, because a forging may have a scant\nplace that it is difficult for the blacksmith to bring up to the size of\n\n\nthe template, and he is in doubt whether there is enough metal in the\nscant place to allow the job to clean up It is better, therefore, to make\nthem to finished sizes, so that he can see at once if the work will clean\nup, notwithstanding the scant place This will lead to no errors in\nlarge work, because such work is marked out by lines, and the scant\npart will therefore be discovered by the machinist, who will line out\nthe piece accordingly Figure 223 is a drawing of a locomotive frame, which the student may\nas well draw three or four times as large as the engraving, which\nbrings us to the subject of enlarging or reducing scales REDUCING SCALES Fig 224 Fig 225 Fig 225a It is sometimes necessary to reduce a drawing to a smaller scale, or to\nfind a minute fraction of a given dimension, such fraction not being\nmarked on the lineal measuring rules at hand Figure 224 represents a\nscale for finding minute fractions Draw seven lines parallel to each\nother, and equidistant draw vertical lines dividing the scale into half-\ninches, as at a, b, c, etc Divide the first space e d into equal halves,\ndraw diagonal lines, and number them as in the figure The distance\nof point 1, which is at the intersection of diagonal with the second\nhorizontal line, will be 1/24 inch from vertical line e Point 2 will be\n2/24 inch from line e, and so on For tenths of inches there would\nrequire to be but six horizontal lines, the diagonals being drawn as\nbefore A similar scale is shown in Figure 225 Draw the lines A B, B\nD, D C, C A, enclosing a square inch Divide each of these lines into\nten equal divisions, and number and letter them as shown Draw also\nthe diagonal lines A 1, a 2, B 3, and so on; then the distances from the\nline A C to the points of intersection of the diagonals with the\nhorizontal lines represent hundredths of an inch Suppose, for example, we trace one diagonal line in its path across the\n\n\nfigure, taking that which starts from A and ends at 1 on the top\nhorizontal line; then where the diagonal intersects horizontal line 1, is\n99/100 from the line B D, and 1/100 from the line A C, while where\nit intersects horizontal line 2, is 98/100 from line B D, and 2/100 from\nline A C, and so on If we require to set the compasses to 67/100 inch,\nwe set them to the radius of n, and the figure 3 on line B D, because\nfrom that 3 to the vertical line d 4 is 6/10 or 60/100 inch, and from\nthat vertical line to the diagonal at n is seven divisions from the line C\nD of the figure In making a drawing to scale, however, it is an excellent plan to draw\na line and divide it off to suit the required scale Suppose, for\nexample, that the given scale is one-quarter size, or three inches per\nfoot; then a line three inches long may be divided into twelve equal\ndivisions, representing twelve inches, and these may be subdivided\ninto half or quarter inches and so on It is recommended to the\nbeginner, however, to spend all his time making simple drawings,\nwithout making them to scale, in order to become so familiar with the\nuse of the instruments as to feel at home with them, avoiding the\ncomplication of early studies that would accompany drawing to scale",
    "It is recommended to the\nbeginner, however, to spend all his time making simple drawings,\nwithout making them to scale, in order to become so familiar with the\nuse of the instruments as to feel at home with them, avoiding the\ncomplication of early studies that would accompany drawing to scale CHAPTER X PROJECTIONS In projecting, the lines in one view are used to mark those in other\nviews, and to find their shapes or curvature as they will appear in\nother views Thus, in Figure 225a we have a spiral, wound around a\ncylinder whose end is cut off at an angle The pitch of the spiral is the\ndistance A B, and we may delineate the curve of the spiral looking at\nthe cylinder from two positions (one at a right-angle to the other, as is\nshown in the figure), by means of a circle having a circumference\nequal to that of the cylinder The circumference of this circle we divide into any number of\nequidistant divisions, as from 1 to 24 The pitch A B of the spiral or\nthread is then divided off also into 24 equidistant divisions, as marked\non the left hand of the figure; vertical lines are then drawn from the\npoints of division on the circle to the points correspondingly\nnumbered on the lines dividing the pitch; and where line 1 on the\ncircle intersects line 1 on the pitch is one point in the curve Similarly,\nwhere point 2 on the circle intersects line 2 on the pitch is another\npoint in the curve, and so on for the whole 24 divisions on the circle\nand on the pitch In this view, however, the path of the spiral from\nline 7 to line 19 lies on the other side of the cylinder, and is marked\nin dotted lines, because it is hidden by the cylinder In the right-hand\nview, however, a different portion of the spiral or thread is hidden,\nnamely from lines 1 to 13 inclusive, being an equal proportion to that\nhidden in the left-hand view Fig 226 The top of the cylinder is shown in the left-hand view to be cut off at\nan angle to the axis, and will therefore appear elliptical; in the right-\nhand view, to delineate this oval, the same vertical lines from the\ncircle may be carried up as shown on the right hand, and horizontal\nlines may be drawn from the inclined face in one view across the end\n\n\nof the other view, as at P; the divisions on the circle may be carried\nup on the right-hand view by means of straight lines, as Q, and arcs of\ncircle, as at R, and vertical lines drawn from these arcs, as line S, and\nwhere these vertical lines S intersect the horizontal lines as P, are\npoints in the ellipse Let it be required to draw a cylindrical body joining another at a\nright-angle; as for example, a Tee, such as in Figure 226, and the\noutline can all be shown in one view, but it is required to find the line\nof junction of one piece, A, with the other, B; that is, find or mark the\nlines of junction C Now when the diameters of A and B are equal, the\nline of junction C is a straight line, but it becomes a curved one when\nthe diameter of A is less than that of B, or vice versa; hence it may be\nas well to project it in both cases For this purpose the three views are\nnecessary One-quarter of the circle of B, in the end view, is divided\noff into any number of equal divisions; thus we have chosen the\ndivisions marked a, b, c, d, e, etc ; a quarter of the top view is\nsimilarly divided off, as at f, g, h, i, j; from these points of division\nlines are projected on to the side view, as shown by the dotted lines k,\nl, m, n, o, p, etc , and where these lines meet, as denoted by the dots,\nis in each case a point in the line of junction of the two cylinders A, B Fig 227 Fig 228 Figure 227 represents a Tee, in which B is less in diameter than A;\nhence the two join in a curve, which is found in a similar manner, as\nis shown in Figure 227 Suppose that the end and top views are\ndrawn, and that the side view is drawn in outline, but that the curve\nof junction or intersection is to be found Now it is evident that since\nthe centre line 1 passes through the side and end views, that the face\na, in the end view, will be even with the face a' in the side view, both\nbeing the same face, and as the full length of the side of B in the end\nview is marked by line b, therefore line c projected down from b will\nat its junction with line b', which corresponds to line b, give the\nextreme depth to which b' extends into the body A, and therefore, the\napex of the curve of intersection of B with A To obtain other points,\nwe divide one-quarter of the circumference of the circle B in the top\nview into four equal divisions, as by lines d, e, f, and from the points\nof division we draw lines j, i, g, to the centre line marked 2, these\n\n\nlines being thickened in the cut for clearness of illustration The\ncompasses are then set to the length of thickened line g, and from\npoint h, in the end view, as a centre, the arc g' is marked With the\ncompasses set to the length of thickened line i, and from h as a centre,\narc i' is marked, and with the length of thickened line j as a radius and\nfrom h as a centre arc j' is marked; from these arcs lines k, l, m are\ndrawn, and from the intersection of k, l, m, with the circle of A, lines\nn, o, p are let fall From the lines of division, d, e, f, the lines q, r, s are\ndrawn, and where lines n, o, p join lines q, r, s, are points in the curve,\nas shown by the dots, and by drawing a line to intersect these dots the\ncurve is obtained on one-half of B Since the axis of B is in the same\nplane as that of A, the lower half of the curve is of the same curvature\nas the upper, as is shown by the dotted curve Fig 229 In Figure 228 the axis of piece B is not in the same plane as that of D,\nbut to one side of it to the distance between the centre lines C, D,\nwhich is most clearly seen in the top view In this case the process is\nthe same except in the following points: In the side view the line w,\ncorresponding to the line w in the end view, passes within the line x\nbefore the curve of intersection begins, and in transferring the lengths\nof the full lines b, c, d, e, f to the end view, and marking the arcs b', c',\nd', e', f', they are marked from the point w (the point where the centre\nline of B intersects the outline of A), instead of from the point x In all\nother respects the construction is the same as that in Figure 227 Fig 230",
    "230 In these examples the axis of B stands at a right-angle to that of A But\nin Figure 229 is shown the construction where the axis of B is not at a\nright-angle to A In this case there is projected from B, in the side\nview, an end view of B as at B', and across this end at a right-angle to\nthe centre line of B is marked a centre line C C of B', which is divided\nas before by lines d, e, f, g, h, their respective lengths being transferred\nfrom W as a centre, and marked by the arcs d', e', f', which are marked\non a vertical line and carried by horizontal lines, to the arc of A as at\ni, j, k From these points, i, j, k, the perpendicular lines l, m, n, o, are\ndropped, and where these lines meet lines p, q, r, s, t, are points in the\ncurve of intersection of B with A It will be observed that each of the\nlines m, n, o, serves for two of the points in the curve; thus, m meets q\n\n\nand s, while n meets p and t, and o meets the outline on each side of\nB, in the side view, and as i, j, k are obtained from d and e, the lines g\nand h might have been omitted, being inserted merely for the sake of\nillustration In Figure 230 is an example in which a cylinder intersects a cone, the\naxes being parallel To obtain the curve of intersection in this case,\nthe side view is divided by any convenient number of lines, as a, b, c,\netc , drawn at a right-angle to its axis A A, and from one end of these\nlines are let fall the perpendiculars f, g, h, i, j; from the ends of these\n(where they meet the centre line of A in the top view), half-circles k, l,\nm, n, o, are drawn to meet the circle of B in the top view, and from\ntheir points of intersection with B, lines p, q, r, s, t, are drawn, and\nwhere these meet lines a, b, c, d and e, which is at u, v, w, x, y, are\npoints in the curve Fig 231 Fig 231 a It will be observed, on referring again to Figure 229, that the branch\nor cylinder B appears to be of elliptical section on its end face, which\noccurs because it is seen at an angle to its end surface; now the\nmethod of finding the ellipse for any given degree of angle is as in\nFigure 231, in which B represents a cylindrical body whose top face\nwould, if viewed from point I, appear as a straight line, while if\nviewed from point J it would appear in outline a circle Now if viewed\nfrom point E its apparent dimension in one direction will obviously be\ndefined by the lines S, Z So that if on a line G G at a right angle to the\nline of vision E, we mark points touching lines S, Z, we get points 1\nand 2, representing the apparent dimension in that direction which is\nthe width of the ellipse The length of the ellipse will obviously be the\nfull diameter of the cylinder B; hence from E as a centre we mark\npoints 3 and 4, and of the remaining points we will speak presently Suppose now the angle the top face of B is viewed from is denoted by\nthe line L, and lines S', Z, parallel to L, will be the width for the ellipse\nwhose length is marked by dots, equidistant on each side of centre\nline G' G', which equal in their widths one from the other the full\ndiameter of B In this construction the ellipse will be drawn away\nfrom the cylinder B, and the ellipse, after being found, would have to\nbe transferred to the end of B But since centre line G G is obviously at\n\n\nthe same angle to A A that A A is to G G, we may start from the centre\nline of the body whose elliptical appearance is to be drawn, and draw\na centre line A A at the same angle to G G as the end of B is supposed\nto be viewed from This is done in Figure 231 a, in which the end face\nof B is to be drawn viewed from a point on the line G G, but at an\nangle of 45 degrees; hence line A A is drawn at an angle of 45 degrees\nto centre line G G, and centre line E is drawn from the centre of the\nend of B at a right angle to G G, and from where it cuts A A, as at F, a\nside view of B is drawn, or a single line of a length equal to the\ndiameter of B may be drawn at a right angle to A A and equidistant on\neach side of F A line, D D, at a right angle to A A, and at any\nconvenient distance above F, is then drawn, and from its intersection\nwith A A as a centre, a circle C equal to the diameter of B is drawn;\none-half of the circumference of C is divided off into any number of\nequal divisions as by arcs a, b, c, d, e, f From these points of division,\nlines g, h, i, j, k, l are drawn, and also lines m, n, o, p, q, r From the\nintersection of these last lines with the face in the side view, lines s, t,\nu, t, w, x, y, z are drawn, and from point F line E is drawn Now it is\nclear that the width of the end face of the cylinder will appear the\nsame from any point of view it may be looked at, hence the sides H H\nare made to equal the diameter of the cylinder B and marked up to\ncentre line E",
    "Now it is\nclear that the width of the end face of the cylinder will appear the\nsame from any point of view it may be looked at, hence the sides H H\nare made to equal the diameter of the cylinder B and marked up to\ncentre line E Fig 232 Fig 233 It is obvious also that the lines s, z, drawn from the extremes of the\nface to be projected will define the width of the ellipse, hence we\nhave four of the points (marked respectively 1, 2, 3, 4) in the ellipse To obtain the remaining points, lines t, u, v, w, x, y (which start from\nthe point on the face F where the lines m, n, o, p, q, r, respectively\nmeet it) are drawn across the face of B as shown The compasses are\nthen set to the radius g; that is, from centre line D to division a on the\ncircle, and this radius is transferred to the face to be projected the\ncompass-point being rested at the intersection of centre line G and\nline t, and two arcs as 5 and 6 drawn, giving two more points in the\ncurve of the ellipse The compasses are then set to the length of line h\n(that is, from centre line D to point of division b), and this distance is\ntransferred, setting the compasses on centre line G where it is\n\n\nintersected by line u, and arcs 7, 8 are marked, giving two more\npoints in the ellipse In like manner points 9 and 10 are obtained from\nthe length of line i, 11 and 12 from that of j; points 13 and 14 from\nthe length of k, and 15 and 16 from l, and the ellipse may be drawn in\nfrom these points It may be pointed out, however, that since points 5 and 6 are the\nsame distance from G that points 15 and 16 are, and since points 7\nand 8 are the same distance from G that points 13 and 14 are, while\npoints 9 and 10 are the same distance from G that 11 and 12 are, the\nlines, j, k, l are unnecessary, since l and g are of equal length, as are\nalso h and k and i and j In Figure 232 the cylinders are line shaded to\nmake them show plainer to the eye, and but three lines (a, b, c) are\nused to get the radius wherefrom to mark the arcs where the points in\nthe ellipse shall fall; thus, radius a gives points 1, 2, 3 and 4; radius b\ngives points 5, 6, 7 and 8, and radius c gives 9, 10, 11 and 12, the\nextreme diameter being obtained from lines S, Z, and H, H CHAPTER XI",
    "CHAPTER XI DRAWING GEAR WHEELS The names given to the various lines of a tooth on a gear-wheel are as\nfollows:\nIn Figure 233, A is the face and B the flank of a tooth, while C is the\npoint, and D the root of the tooth; E is the height or depth, and F the\nbreadth P P is the pitch circle, and the space between the two teeth,\nas H, is termed a space Fig 234 Fig 235 235 It is obvious that the points of the teeth and the bottoms of the spaces,\nas well as the pitch circle, are concentric to the axis of the wheel bore And to pencil in the teeth these circles must be fully drawn, as in\nFigure 234, in which P P is the pitch circle This circle is divided into\nas many equal divisions as the wheel is to have teeth, these divisions\nbeing denoted by the radial lines, A, B, C, etc Where these divisions\nintersect the pitch circle are the centres from which all the teeth\ncurves may be drawn The compasses are set to a radius equal to the\npitch, less one-half the thickness of the tooth, and from a centre, as R,\ntwo face curves, as F G, may be marked; from the next centre, as at S,\nthe curves D E may be marked, and so on for all the faces; that is, the\ntooth curves lying between the outer circle X and the pitch circle P For the flank curves, that is, the curve from P to Y, the compasses are\nset to a radius equal to the pitch; and from the sides of the teeth the\nflank curves are drawn Thus from J, as a centre flank, K is drawn;\nfrom V, as a centre flank, H is drawn, and so on The proportions of the teeth for cast gears generally accepted in this\n\n\ncountry are those given by Professor Willis, as average practice, and\nare as follows:\nDepth to pitch line, 3/10 of the pitch Working depth,\n6/10\n\"\n\"\nWhole depth,\n7/10\n\"\n\"\nThickness of tooth, 5/11\n\"\n\"\nBreadth of space,\n6/11\n\"\n\"\nInstead, however, of calculating the dimensions these proportions give\nfor any particular pitch, a diagram or scale may be made from which\nthey may be taken for any pitch by a direct application of the\ncompasses A scale of this kind is given in Figure 235, in which the\nline A B is divided into inches and parts to represent the pitches; its\ntotal length representing the coarsest pitch within the capacity of the\nscale; and, the line B C (at a right-angle to A B) the whole depth of the\ntooth for the coarsest pitch, being 7/10 of the length of A B Fig 236 The other diagonal lines are for the proportion of the dimensions\nmarked on the figure Thus the depth of face, or distance from the\npitch line to the extremity or tooth point for a 4 inch pitch, would be\nmeasured along the line B C, from the vertical line B to the first\ndiagonal The thickness of the tooth would be for a 4 inch pitch along\nline B C from B to the second diagonal, and so on For a 3 inch pitch\nthe measurement would be taken along the horizontal line, starting\nfrom the 3 on the line A B, and so on On the left of the diagram or\nscale is marked the lbs strain each pitch will safely transmit per inch\nwidth of wheel face, according to Professor Marks Fig 237 The application of the scale as follows: The pitch circles P P and P' P',\nFigure 236, for the respective wheels, are drawn, and the height of the\nteeth is obtained from the scale and marked beyond the pitch circles,\nwhen circles Q and Q' may be drawn Similarly, the depths of the\nteeth within the pitch circles are obtained from the scale or diagram\nand marked within the respective pitch circles, and circles R and R'\nare marked in The pitch circles are divided off into as many points of\n\n\nequal division, as at a, b, c, d, e, etc , as the respective wheels are to\nhave teeth, and the thickness of tooth having been obtained from the\nscale, this thickness is marked from the points of division on the pitch\ncircles, as at f in the figure, and the tooth curves may then be drawn\nin It may be observed, however, that the tooth thicknesses will not be\nstrictly correct, because the scale gives the same chord pitch for the\nteeth on both wheels which will give different arc pitches to the teeth\non the two wheels; whereas, it is the arc pitches, and not the chord\npitches, that should be correct This error obviously increases as there\nis a greater amount of difference between the two wheels The curves given to the teeth in Figure 234 are not the proper ones to\ntransmit uniform motion, but are curves merely used by draughtsmen\nto save the trouble of finding the true curves, which if it be required,\nmay be drawn with a very near approach to accuracy, as follows,\nwhich is a construction given by Rankine:\nDraw the rolling circle D, Figure 237, and draw A D, the line of\ncentres From the point of contact at C, mark on D, a point distant\nfrom C one-half the amount of the pitch, as at P, and draw the line P\nC of indefinite length beyond C Draw the line P E passing through the\nline of centres at E, which is equidistant between C and A Then\nincrease the length of line P F to the right of C by an amount equal to\nthe radius A C, and then diminish it to an amount equal to the radius\nE D, thus obtaining the point F and the latter will be the location of\ncentre for compasses to strike the face curve Fig 238 Fig 239 Another method of finding the face curve, with compasses, is as\nfollows: In Figure 238 let P P represent the pitch circle of the wheel to\nbe marked, and B C the path of the centre of the generating or\ndescribing circle as it rolls outside of P P Let the point B represent the\ncentre of the generating circle when it is in contact with the pitch\ncircle at A Then from B mark off, on B C, any number of equidistant\npoints, as D, E, F, G, H, and from A mark on the pitch circle, with the\nsame radius, an equal number of points of division, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 With the compasses set to the radius of the generating circle, that is, A\nB, from B, as a centre, mark the arc I, from D, the arc J, from E, the\narc K, from F, and so on, marking as many arcs as there are points of\ndivision on B C With the compasses set to the radius of divisions 1, 2,\netc , step off on arc M the five divisions, N, O, S, T, V, and at V will be\na point on the epicycloidal curve From point of division 4, step off on\nL four points of division, as a, b, c, d; and d will be another point on\nthe epicycloidal curve From point 3, set off three divisions, and so on,\nand through the points so obtained draw by hand, or with a scroll, the\ncurve Hypocycloids for the flanks of the teeth maybe traced in a similar\nmanner Thus in Figure 239, P P is the pitch circle, and B C the line of\nmotion of the centre of the generating circle to be rolled within P P From 1 to 6 are points of equal division on the pitch circle, and D to I\nare arc locations for the centre of the generating circle Starting from\nA, which represents the location for the centre of the generating\ncircle, the point of contact between the generating and base circles\nwill be at B Then from 1 to 6 are points of equal division on the pitch\ncircle, and from D to I are the corresponding locations for the centres\nof the generating circle From these centres the arcs J, K, L, M, N, O,\nare struck The six divisions on O, from a to f, give at f a point in the\ncurve Five divisions on N, four on M, and so on, give, respectively,\npoints in the curve There is this, however, to be noted concerning the construction of the\nlast two figures Since the circle described by the centre of the\ngenerating circle is of a different arc or curve to that of the pitch\n\n\ncircle, the length of an arc having an equal radius on each will be\ndifferent The amount is so small as to be practically correct The\ndirection of the error is to give to the curves a less curvature, as\nthough they had been produced by a generating circle of larger\ndiameter Suppose, for example, that the difference between the arc a,\nb, and its chord is 1, and that the difference between the arc 4, 5, and\nits chord is 01, then the error in one step is 09, and, as the point f is\nformed in five steps, it will contain this error multiplied five times Point d would contain it multiplied three times, because it has three\nsteps, and so on The error will increase in proportion as the diameter of the generating\nis less than that of the pitch circle, and though in large wheels,\nworking with large wheels, so that the difference between the radius\nof the generating circle and that of the smallest wheel is not excessive,\nit is so small as to be practically inappreciable, yet in small wheels,\nworking with large ones, it may form a sensible error Fig 240 For showing the dimensions through the arms and hub, a sectional\nview of a section of the wheel may be given, as in Figure 240, which\nrepresents a section of a wheel, and a pinion, and on these two views\nall the necessary dimensions may be marked Fig 240 a (Page 203 )\nIf it is desired to draw an edge view of a wheel (which the student\nwill find excellent practice), the lines for the teeth may be projected\nfrom the teeth in the side view, as in Figure 240 a Thus tooth E is\nprojected by drawing lines from the corners A, B, C, in the side view\nacross the face in the edge view, as at A, B, C in the latter view, and\nsimilar lines may be obtained in the same way for all the teeth When the teeth of wheels are to be cut to form in a gear-cutting\n\n\nmachine, the thickness of the teeth is nearly equal to the thickness of\nthe spaces, there being just sufficient difference to prevent the teeth of\none wheel from becoming locked in the spaces of the other; but when\nthe teeth are to be cast upon the wheel, the tooth thickness is made\nless than the width of the space to an amount that is usually a certain\nproportion of the pitch, and is termed the side clearance In all\nwheels, whether with cut or cast teeth, there is given a certain amount\nof top and bottom clearance; that is to say, the points of the teeth of\none wheel do not reach to the bottom of the spaces in the other Thus\nin the Pratt and Whitney system the top and bottom clearance is one-\neighth of the pitch, while in the Brown and Sharpe system for involute\nteeth the clearance is equal to one-tenth the thickness of the tooth In drawing bevil gear wheels, the pitch line of each tooth on each\nwheel, and the surfaces of the points, as well as those at the bottom of\nthe spaces, must all point to a centre, as E in Figure 241, which centre\nis where the axes of the shafts would meet It is unnecessary to mark\nin the correct curves for the teeth, for reasons already stated, with\nreference to the curves for a spur wheel But if it is required to do so,\nthe construction to find the curves is as shown in Figure 242, in which\nlet A A represent the axis of one shaft, and B that of the other of the\npair of bevil wheels that are to work together, their axes meeting at\nW; draw the line E at a right angle to A A, and representing the pitch\ncircle diameter of one wheel, and draw F at a right angle to B, and\nrepresenting the pitch circle of the other wheel; draw the line G G,\npassing through the point W and the point T, where the pitch circles\nor lines E F meet, and G G will be the line of contact of the tooth of\none wheel upon the tooth of the other wheel; or in other words, the\npitch line of the tooth Fig 241 Fig 242 Draw lines, as H and I, representing the tooth breadth From W, as a\ncentre, draw on each side of G G dotted lines, as P, representing the\nheight of the tooth above and below the pitch line G G At a right\nangle to G G draw the line J K; and from where this line meets B, as at\nQ, mark the arc a, which will represent the pitch circle for the large\ndiameter of the pinion D [The smallest wheel of a pair of gears is\ntermed the pinion ] Draw the arc b for the height, and circle c for the\n\n\ndepth of the teeth, thus defining the height of the tooth at that end Similarly from P, as a centre mark (for the large diameter of wheel C,)\narcs g, h, and i, arc g representing the pitch circle, i the height, and h\nthe depth of the tooth On these arcs draw the proper tooth curves in\nthe same manner as for spur wheels; that is, obtain the curves by the\nconstruction shown in Figures 237, or by those in Figures 238 and\n239 To obtain the arcs for the other end of the tooth, draw line M M\nparallel to line J K; set the compasses to the radius R L, and from P, as\na centre, draw the pitch circle k For the depth of the tooth draw the\ndotted line p, meeting the circle h and the point W A similar line,\nfrom i to W, will give the height of the tooth at its inner end Then the\ntooth curves may be drawn on these three arcs, k, l, m, in the same as\nif they were for a spur wheel Similarly for the pitch circle of the inner and small end of the pinion\nteeth, set the compasses to radius S L, and from Q as a centre mark\nthe pitch circle d Outside of d mark e for the height above pitch lines\nof the tooth, and inside of d mark the arc f for the depth below pitch\nline of the tooth at that end The distance between the dotted lines as\np, represents the full height of the tooth; hence h meets p, which is the\nroot of the tooth on the large wheel To give clearance and prevent\nthe tops of the teeth on one wheel from bearing against the bottoms of\nthe spaces in the other wheel, the point of the pinion teeth is marked\nbelow; thus arc b does not meet h or p, but is short to the amount of\nclearance Having obtained the arcs d, e, f, the curves may be marked\nthereon as for a spur wheel A tooth thus marked is shown at x, and\nfrom its curves between b and c, a template may be made for the large\ndiameter or outer end of the pinion teeth Similarly for the wheel C\nthe outer end curves are marked on the arcs g, h, i, and those for the\nother end of the tooth are marked between the arcs l, m Fig 243 (Page 207 )\nFig 244 Figure 243 represents a drawing of one-half of a bevil gear, and an\nedge view projected from the same The point E corresponds to point\nE in Figure 241, or W in 242 The line F shows that the top surface of\nthe teeth points to E Line G shows that the pitch line of each tooth\npoints to E, and lines H show that the bottom of the surface of a space\nalso points to E Line 1 shows that the sides of each tooth point to E And it follows that the outer end of a tooth is both higher or deeper\nand also thicker than its inner end; thus J is thicker and deeper than\nend K of the tooth Lines F G, representing the top and bottom of a\ntooth in Figure 243, obviously correspond to dotted lines p in Figure\n242 The outer and inner ends of the teeth in the edge view are\nprojected from the outer and inner ends in the face view, as is shown\nby the dotted lines carried from tooth L in the face view, to tooth L in\nthe edge view, and it is obvious from what has been said that in\ndrawing the lines for the tooth in the edge view they will point to the\ncentre E Fig 245 To save work in drawing bevil gear wheels, they are sometimes drawn\nin section or in outline only; thus in Figure 244 is shown a pair of\nbevil wheels shown in section, and in Figure 245 is a drawing of a\npart of an Ames lathe feed motion B C D and E are spur gears, while\nG H and I are bevil gears, the cone surface on which the teeth lie\nbeing left blank, save at the edges where a tooth is in each case drawn\nin Wheel D is shown in section so as to show the means by which it\nmay be moved out of gear with C and E Small bevil gears may also be\nrepresented by simple line shading; thus in Figure 247 the two bodies\nA and C would readily be understood to be a bevil gear and pinion Similarly small spur wheels\nmay be represented by simple circles in a side view and by line\nshading in an edge view; thus it would answer every practical purpose\nif such small wheels as in Figures 246 and 247 at D, F, G, K, P, H, I\nand J, were drawn as shown The pitch circles, however, are usually\ndrawn in red ink to distinguish them Fig 246 Fig 247 In Figure 248 is an example in which part of the gear is shown with\nteeth in, and the remainder is illustrated by circles Fig 248 In Figure 250 is a drawing of part of the feed motions of a Niles Tool\nWorks horizontal boring mill, Figure 251 being an end view of the\nsame, f is a friction disk, and g a friction pinion, g' is a rack, F is a\nfeed-screw, p is a bevil pinion, and q a bevil wheel; i, m, o, are gear\nwheels, and J a worm operating a worm-pinion and the gears shown Figure 249 represents three bevil gears, the upper of which is line\nshaded, forming an excellent example for the student to copy Fig 249 (Page 210 )\nFig 250 Fig 251 (Page 209 )\nThe construction of oval gearing is shown in Figures 252, 253, 254,\n255, and 256 The pitch-circle is drawn by the construction for\ndrawing an ellipse that was given with reference to Figure 81, but as\nthat construction is by means of arcs of circles, and therefore not\nstrictly correct, Professor McCord, in an article on elliptical gearing,\nsays, concerning it and the construction of oval gearing generally, as\nfollows:\nFig",
    "The pitch-circle is drawn by the construction for\ndrawing an ellipse that was given with reference to Figure 81, but as\nthat construction is by means of arcs of circles, and therefore not\nstrictly correct, Professor McCord, in an article on elliptical gearing,\nsays, concerning it and the construction of oval gearing generally, as\nfollows:\nFig 252 But these circular arcs may be rectified and subdivided with great\nfacility and accuracy by a very simple process, which we take from\nProf Rankine's \"Machinery and Mill Work,\" and is illustrated in Figure\n252 Let O B be tangent at O to the arc O D, of which C is the centre Draw the chord D O, bisect it in E, and produce it to A, making O\nA=O E; with centre A and radius A D describe an arc cutting the\ntangent in B; then O B will be very nearly equal in length to the arc O\n\n\nD, which, however, should not exceed about 60 degrees; if it be 60\ndegrees, the error is theoretically about 1/900 of the length of the arc,\nO B being so much too short; but this error varies with the fourth\npower of the angle subtended by the arc, so that for 30 degrees it is\nreduced to 1/16 of that amount, that is, to 1/14400 Conversely, let O\nB be a tangent of given length; make O F=1/4 O B; then with centre\nF and radius F B describe an arc cutting the circle O D G (tangent to O\nB at O) in the point D; then O D will be approximately equal to O B,\nthe error being the same as in the other construction and following\nthe same law The extreme simplicity of these two constructions and the facility with\nwhich they may be made with ordinary drawing instruments make\nthem exceedingly convenient, and they should be more widely known\nthan they are Their application to the present problem is shown in\nFigure 253, which represents a quadrant of an ellipse, the\napproximate arcs C D, E, E F, F A having been determined by trial and\nerror In order to space this off, for the positions of the teeth, a\ntangent is drawn at D, upon which is constructed the rectification of D\nC, which is D G, and also that of D E in the opposite direction, that is,\nD H, by the process just explained Then, drawing the tangent at F, we\nset off in the same manner F I = F E, and F K = F A, and then\nmeasuring H L = I K, we have finally G L, equal to the whole\nquadrant of the ellipse Fig 253 Fig 254 Let it now be required to lay out twenty-four teeth upon this ellipse;\nthat is, six in each quadrant; and for symmetry's sake we will suppose\nthat the centre of one tooth is to be at A, and that of another at C,\nFigure 253 We, therefore, divide L G into six equal parts at the points\n1, 2, 3, etc , which will be the centres of the teeth upon the rectified\nellipse It is practically necessary to make the spaces a little greater\nthan the teeth; but if the greatest attainable exactness in the operation\nof the wheels is aimed at, it is important to observe that backlash, in\nelliptical gearing, has an effect quite different from that resulting in\nthe case of circular wheels When the pitch-curves are circles, they are\nalways in contact; and we may, if we choose, make the tooth only half\nthe breadth of the space, so long as its outline is correct When the\n\n\nmotion of the driver is reversed, the follower will stand still until the\nbacklash is taken up, when the motion will go on with a perfectly\nconstant velocity ratio as before But in the case of two elliptical\nwheels, if the follower stand still while the driver moves, which must\nhappen when the motion is reversed if backlash exists, the pitch-\ncurves are thrown out of contact, and, although the continuity of the\nmotion will not be interrupted, the velocity ratio will be affected If\nthe motion is never to be reversed, the perfect law of the velocity\nratio due to the elliptical pitch-curve may be preserved by reducing\nthe thickness of the tooth, not equally on each side, as is done in\ncircular wheels, but wholly on the side not in action But if the\nmachine must be capable of acting indifferently in both directions, the\nreduction must be made on both sides of the tooth: evidently the\naction will be slightly impaired, for which reason the backlash should\nbe reduced to a minimum Precisely what is the minimum is not so\neasy to say, as it evidently depends much upon the excellence of the\ntools and the skill of the workman In many treatises on constructive\nmechanism it is variously stated that the backlash should be from one-\nfifteenth to one-eleventh of the pitch, which would seem to be an\nample allowance in reasonably good castings not intended to be\nfinished, and quite excessive if the teeth are to be cut; nor is it very\nobvious that its amount should depend upon the pitch any more than\nupon the precession of the equinoxes On paper, at any rate, we may\nreduce it to zero, and make the teeth and spaces equal in breadth, as\nshown in the figure, the teeth being indicated by the double lines Those upon the portion L H are then laid off upon K I, after which\nthese divisions are transferred to the ellipse by the second of Prof Rankine's constructions, and we are then ready to draw the teeth The outlines of these, as of any other teeth upon pitch-curves which\nroll together in the same plane, depend upon the general law that\nthey must be such as can be marked out upon the planes of the\ncurves, as they roll by a tracing-point, which is rigidly connected with\nand carried by a third line, moving in rolling contact with both the\npitch-curves And since under that condition the motion of this third\nline, relatively to each of the others, is the same as though it rolled\nalong each of them separately while they remained fixed, the process\nof constructing the generated curves becomes comparatively simple For the describing line we naturally select a circle, which, in order to\nfulfil the condition, must be small enough to roll within the pitch\n\n\nellipse; its diameter is determined by the consideration that if it be\nequal to A P, the radius of the arc A F, the flanks of the teeth in that\nregion will be radial We have, therefore, chosen a circle whose\ndiameter, A B, is three-fourths of A P, as shown, so that the teeth,\neven at the ends of the wheels, will be broader at the base than on the\npitch line This circle ought strictly to roll upon the true elliptical\ncurve; and assuming, as usual, the tracing-point upon the\ncircumference, the generated curves would vary slightly from true\nepicycloids, and no two of those used in the same quadrant of the\nellipse would be exactly alike Were it possible to divide the ellipse\naccurately, there would be no difficulty in laying out these curves; but\nhaving substituted the circular arcs, we must now roll the generating\ncircle upon these as bases, thus forming true epicycloidal teeth, of\nwhich those lying upon the same approximating arc will be exactly\nalike Should the junction of two of these arcs fall within the breadth\nof a tooth, as at D, evidently both the face and the flank on one side of\nthat tooth will be different from those on the other side; should the\njunction coincide with the edge of a tooth, which is very nearly the\ncase at F, then the face on that side will be the epicycloid belonging to\none of the arcs, its flank a hypocycloid belonging to the other; and it\nis possible that either the face or the flank on one side should be\ngenerated by the rolling of the describing circle partly on one arc,\npartly on the one adjacent, which, upon a large scale, and where the\nbest results are aimed at, may make a sensible change in the form of\nthe curve The convenience of the constructions given in Figure 252 is nowhere\nmore apparent than in the drawing of the epicycloids, when, as in the\ncase in hand the base and generating circles may be of\nincommensurable diameters; for which reason we have, in Figure 254,\nshown its application in connection with the most rapid and accurate\nmode yet known of describing those curves Let C be the centre of the\nbase circle; B, that of the rolling one; A, the point of contact Divide\nthe semi-circumference of B into six equal parts at 1, 2, 3, etc ; draw\nthe common tangent at A, upon which rectify the arc A 2 by process\nNo 1; then by process No 2 set out an equal arc A 2 on the base\ncircle, and stepping it off three times to the right and left, bisect these\nspaces, thus making subdivisions on the base circle equal in length to\nthose on the rolling one Take in succession as radii the chords A 1, A\n2, A 3, etc , of the describing circle, and with centres 1, 2, 3, etc , on\n\n\nthe base circle, strike arcs either externally or internally, as shown\nrespectively on the right and left; the curve tangent to the external\narcs is the epicycloid, that tangent to the internal ones the\nhypocycloid, forming the face and flank of a tooth for the base circle Fig 255 In the diagram, Figure 253, we have shown a part of an ellipse whose\nlength is ten inches, and breadth six, the figure being half size In\norder to give an idea of the actual appearance of the combination\nwhen complete, we show in Figure 255 the pair in gear, on a scale of\nthree inches to the foot The excessive eccentricity was selected\nmerely for the purpose of illustration Figure 255 will serve also to\ncall attention to another serious circumstance, which is, that although\nthe ellipses are alike, the wheels are not; nor can they be made so if\nthere be an even number of teeth, for the obvious reason that a tooth\nupon one wheel must fit into a space on the other; and since in the\nfirst wheel, Figure 255, we chose to place a tooth at the extremity of\neach axis, we must in the second one place there a space instead;\nbecause at one time the major axes must coincide; at another, the\nminor axes, as in Figure 255 If, then, we use even numbers, the\ndistribution, and even the forms of the teeth, are not the same in the\ntwo wheels of the pair But this complication may be avoided by using\nan odd number of teeth, since, placing a tooth at one extremity of the\nmajor axes, a space will come at the other It is not, however, always necessary to cut teeth all round these\nwheels, as will be seen by an examination of Figure 256, C and D\nbeing the fixed centres of the two ellipses in contact at P Now P must\nbe on the line C D, whence, considering the free foci, we see that P B\nis equal to P C, and P A to P D; and the common tangent at P makes\nequal angles with C P and P A, as is also with P B and P D; therefore,\nC D being a straight line, A B is also a straight line and equal to C D If\nthen the wheels be overhung, that is, fixed on the ends of the shafts\noutside the bearings, leaving the outer faces free, the moving foci may\nbe connected by a rigid link A B, as shown Fig 256",
    "256 This link will then communicate the same motion that would result\nfrom the use of the complete elliptical wheels, and we may therefore\ndispense with the most of the teeth, retaining only those near the\nextremities of the major axes, which are necessary in order to assist\nand control the motion of the link at and near the dead-points The\narc of the pitch-curves through which the teeth must extend will vary\nwith their eccentricity; but in many cases it would not be greater than\nthat which in the approximation may be struck about one centre; so\nthat, in fact, it would not be necessary to go through the process of\nrectifying and subdividing the quarter of the ellipse at all, as in this\ncase it can make no possible difference whether the spacing adopted\nfor the teeth to be cut would \"come out even\" or not, if carried around\nthe curve By this expedient, then, we may save not only the trouble\nof drawing, but a great deal of labor in making, the teeth round the\nwhole ellipse We might even omit the intermediate portions of the\npitch ellipses themselves; but as they move in rolling contact their\nretention can do no harm, and in one part of the movement will be\nbeneficial, as they will do part of the work; for if, when turning, as\nshown by the arrows, we consider the wheel whose axis is D as the\ndriver, it will be noted that its radius of contact, C P, is on the\nincrease; and so long as this is the case the other wheel will be\ncompelled to move by contact of the pitch lines, although the link be\nomitted And even if teeth be cut all round the wheels, this link is a\ncomparatively inexpensive and a useful addition to the combination,\nespecially if the eccentricity be considerable Of course the wheels\nshown in Figure 255 might also have been made alike, by placing a\ntooth at one end of the major axis and a space at the other, as above\nsuggested In regard to the variation in the velocity ratio, it will be\nseen, by reference to Figure 256, that if D be the axis of the driver, the\nfollower will in the position there shown move faster, the ratio of the\nangular velocities being P × D/P × B; if the driver turn uniformly,\nthe velocity of the follower will diminish, until at the end of half a\nrevolution, the velocity ratio will be P × B/P × D; in the other half\nof the revolution these changes will occur in a reverse order But P D\n= L B; if then the centres B D are given in position, we know L P, the\nmajor axis; and in order to produce any assumed maximum or\nminimum velocity ratio, we have only to divide L P into segments\n\n\nwhose ratio is equal to that assumed value, which will give the foci of\nthe ellipse, whence the minor axis may be found and the curve\ndescribed For instance, in Figure 255 the velocity ratio being nine to\none at the maximum, the major axis is divided into two parts, of\nwhich one is nine times as long as the other; in Figure 256 the ratio is\nas one to three, so that the major axis being divided into four parts,\nthe distance A C between the foci is equal to two of them, and the\ndistance of either focus from the nearest extremity of the major axis is\nequal to one, and from the more remote extremity is equal to three of\nthese parts CHAPTER XII PLOTTING MECHANICAL MOTIONS Fig 257 Let it be required to find how much motion an eccentric will give to\nits rod, the distance from the centre of its bore to the centre of the\ncircumference, which is called the throw, being the distance from A to\nB in Figure 257 Now as the eccentric is moved around by the shaft, it\nis evident that the axis of its motion will be the axis A of the shaft Then from A as a centre, and with radius from A to C, we draw the\ndotted circle D, and from E to F will be the amount of motion of the\nrod in the direction of the arrow This becomes obvious if we suppose a lead pencil to be placed against\nthe eccentric at E, and suppose the eccentric to make half a\nrevolution, whereupon the pencil will be pushed out to F If now we\nmeasure the distance from E to F, we shall find it is just twice that\nfrom A to B We may find the amount of motion, however, in another\nway, as by striking the dotted half circle G, showing the path of\nmotion of B, the diameter of this path of motion being the amount of\nlateral motion given to the rod Fig 258 In Figure 258 is a two arm lever fast upon the same axis or shaft, and\nit is required to find how much a given amount of motion of the long\narm will move the short one Suppose the distance the long arm\nmoves is to A Then draw the line B from A to the axis of the shaft,\nand the line C the centre line of the long arm From the axis of the\nshaft as a centre, draw the circle D, passing through the eye or centre\nE of the short arm Take the radius from F to G, and from E as a\ncentre mark it on D as at H, and H is where E will be when the long\narm moves to A We have here simply decreased the motion in the\nsame proportion as one arm is shorter than the other The principle\ninvolved is to take the motion of both arms at an equal distance from\ntheir axis of motion, which is the axis of the shaft S",
    "The principle\ninvolved is to take the motion of both arms at an equal distance from\ntheir axis of motion, which is the axis of the shaft S Fig 259 In Figure 259 we have a case in which the end of a lever acts directly\nupon a shoe Now let it be required to find how much a given motion\nof the lever will cause the shoe to slide along the line x; the point H is\nhere found precisely as before, and from it as a centre, the dotted\ncircle equal in diameter to the small circle at E is drawn from the\nperimeter of the dotted circle, a dotted line is carried up and another\nis carried up from the face of the shoe The distance K between these\ndotted lines is the amount of motion of the shoe In Figure 260 we have the same conditions as in Figure 259, but the\nshort arm has a roller acting against a larger roller R The point H is\nfound as before The amount of motion of R is the distance of K from\nJ; hence we may transfer this distance from the centre of R, producing\nthe point P, from which the new position may be marked by a dotted\ncircle as shown Fig 260 In Figure 261 a link is introduced in place of the roller, and it is\nrequired to find the amount of motion of rod R The point H is found\nas before, and then the length from centre to centre of link L is found,\nand with this radius and from H as a centre the arc P is drawn, and\nwhere P intersects the centre line J of R is the new position for the\neye or centre Q of R Fig 261 In Figure 262 we have a case of a similar lever actuating a plunger in\na vertical line, it being required to find how much a given amount of\nmotion of the long arm will actuate the plunger Suppose the long arm\nto move to A, then draw the lines B C and the circle D Take the\nradius or distance F, G, and from E mark on D the arc H Mark the\ncentre line J of the rod Now take the length from E to I of the link,\nand from H as a centre mark arc K, and at the intersection of K with J\nis where the eye I will be when the long arm has moved to A Fig 262 In Figure 263 are two levers upon their axles or shafts S and S'; arm A\n\n\nis connected by a link to arm B, and arm C is connected direct to a rod\nR It is required to find the position of centre G of the rod eye when D\nis in position E, and when it is also in position F Now the points E\nand F are, of course, on an arc struck from the axis S, and it is obvious\nthat in whatever position the centre H may be it will be somewhere\non the arc I, I, which is struck from the centre S' Now suppose that D\nmoves to E, and if we take the radius D, H, and from E mark it upon\nthe arc I as at V, then H will obviously be the new position of H To\nfind the new position of G we first strike the arc J, J, because in every\nposition of G it will be somewhere on the arc J, J To find where that\nwill be when H is at V, take the radius H, G, and from V as a centre\nmark it on J, J, as at K, which is the position of G when D is at E and\nH is at V For the positions when D is at F we repeat the process,\ntaking the radius D, H, and from F marking P, and with the radius H,\nG, and from P as a centre marking Q; then P is the new position for H,\nand Q is that for G Fig 263 In Figure 264 a lever arm A and cam C are in one piece on a shaft S is\na shoe sliding on the line x, and held against the cam face by the rod\nR; it is required to find the position of the face of the shoe against the\ncam when the end of the arm is at D Draw line E from D to the axis of the shaft and line F From the shaft\naxis as a centre draw circle W; draw line J parallel to x Take the\nradius G H, and from K as a centre mark point P on W; draw line Q\nfrom the shaft axis through P, and mark point T From the shaft axis\nas a centre draw from T an arc, cutting J at V, and V is the point\nwhere the face of the shoe and the face of the cam will touch when\nthe arm stands at D Fig 264",
    "264 Let it be required to find the amount of motion imparted in a straight\nline to a rod attached to an eccentric strap, and the following\nconstruction may be used In Figure 265 let A represent the centre of\nthe shaft, and, therefore, the axis about which the eccentric revolves Let B represent the centre of the eccentric, and let it be required to\nfind in what position on the line of motion x, the centre C of the rod\neye will be when the centre B of the eccentric has moved to E Now\n\n\nsince A is the axis, the centre B of the eccentric must rotate about it as\ndenoted by the circle D, and all that is necessary to find the position\nof C for any position of eccentric is to mark the position of B on circle\nD, as at E, and from that position, as from E, as a centre, and with the\nlength of the rod as a radius, mark the new position of C on the line x\nof its motion With the centre of the eccentric at B, the line Q,\nrepresenting the faces of the straps, will stand at a right angle to the\nline of motion, and the length of the rod is from B to C; when the\neccentric centre moves to E, the centre line of the rod will be moved\nto position P, the line Q will have assumed position R, and point C\nwill have moved from its position in the drawing to G on line x If the\neccentric centre be supposed to move on to F, the point C will move\nto H, the radii B C, E G, and F H all being equal in length Now when\nthe eccentric centre is at E it will have moved one-quarter of a\nrevolution, and yet the point C will only have moved to G, which is\nnot central between C and H, as is denoted by the dotted half circle I Fig 265",
    "265 On the other hand, while the eccentric centre is moving from E to F,\nwhich is but one-quarter of a revolution, the rod end will move from\nG to H This occurs because the rod not only moves endwise, but the\nend connected to the eccentric strap moves towards and away from\nthe line x This is shown in the figure, the rod centre line being\nmarked in full line from B to x And when B has moved to E, the rod\ncentre line is marked by dotted line E, so that it has moved away from\nthe line of motion B x In Figure 266 the eccentric centre is shown to\nstand at an angle of 45 degrees from line q, which is at a right angle\nto the line of motion x x, and the position of the rod end is shown at\nC, J and H representing the extremes of motion, and G the centre of\nthe motion Fig 266 266 If now we suppose the eccentric centre to stand at T, which is also an\nangle of 45 degrees to q, then the rod end will stand at K, which is\n\n\nfurther away from G than C is; hence we find that on account of the\nmovement of the rod out of the straight end motion, the motion of the\nrod end becomes irregular in proportion to that of the eccentric,\nwhose action in moving the eye C of the rod in a straight line is\nincreased (by the rod) while it is moving through the half rotation\ndenoted by V in figure, and diminished during the other half rotation In many cases, as, for example, on the river steamboats in the Western\nand Southern States, cams are employed instead of eccentrics, and the\nprinciples involved in drawing or marking out such cams are given in\nthe following remarks, which contain the substance of a paper read by\nLewis Johnson before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers In Figure 267 is a side view of a pair of cams; one, C, being a full\nstroke cam for operating the valve that admits steam to the engine\ncylinder; and the other, D, being a cam to cut off the steam supply at\nthe required point in the engine stroke The positions of these cams\nwith relation to the position of the crank-pin need not be commented\nupon here, more than to remark that obviously the cam C must\noperate to open the steam inlet valve in advance of cam D, which\noperates to close it and cause the steam to act expansively in the\ncylinder, and that the angle of the throw line of the cut-off valve D to\nthe other cam or to the crank-pin varies according as it is required to\ncut off the steam either earlier or later in the stroke The cam yoke is composed of two halves, Y and Y', bolted together by\nbolts B, which have a collar at one end and two nuts at the other end,\nthe inner nuts N N enabling the letting together of the two halves\nFig 267 of the yoke to take up the wear It is obvious that as the shaft revolves\nand carries the cam with it, it will, by reason of its shape, move the\nyoke back and forth; thus, in the position of the parts shown in Figure\n267, the direction of rotation being denoted by the arrow, cam C will,\nas it rotates, move the yoke to the left, and this motion will occur\nfrom the time corner a of the cam meets the face of Y' until corner b\nhas passed the centre line d Now since that part of the circumference\n\n\nlying between points a and b of the cam is an arc of a circle, of which\nthe axis of the shaft is the centre, the yoke will remain at rest until\nsuch time as b has passed line d and corner a meets the jaw Y of the\nyoke; hence the period of rest is determined by the amount of\ncircumference that is made concentric to the shaft; or, in other words,\nis determined by the distance between a and b The object of using a cam instead of an eccentric is to enable the\nopening of the valves abruptly at the beginning of the piston stroke,\nmaintaining a uniform steam-port opening during nearly the entire\nlength of stroke, and as abruptly closing the valves at the termination\nof the stroke Figure 268 is a top view of the mechanism in Figure 267; and Figure\n269 shows an end view of the yoke At B, in Figure 268, is shown a\nguide through which the yoke-stem passes so as to be guided to move\nin a straight line, there being a guide of this kind on each side of the\nyoke Fig 268 The two cams are bolted to a collar that is secured to the crank-shaft,\nand are made in halves, as shown in the figures and also in Figures\n270 and 271, which represent cams removed from the other\nmechanism To enable a certain amount of adjustment of the cams\nupon the collar, the bolts which hold them to the collar fit closely in\nthe holes in the collar, but the cams are provided with oblong bolt\nholes as shown, so that the position of either cam, either with relation\nto the other cam or with relation to the crank-pin, can be adjusted to\nthe extent permitted by the length of the oblong holes",
    "To enable a certain amount of adjustment of the cams\nupon the collar, the bolts which hold them to the collar fit closely in\nthe holes in the collar, but the cams are provided with oblong bolt\nholes as shown, so that the position of either cam, either with relation\nto the other cam or with relation to the crank-pin, can be adjusted to\nthe extent permitted by the length of the oblong holes Fig 269 269 The crank is assumed in the figures to be on its dead centre nearest to\nthe engine cylinder, and to revolve in the direction of the arrows The\ncams are so arranged that their plain unflanged surfaces bolt against\n\n\nthe collar The method of drawing or marking out a full stroke cam, such as C in\nFigure 267, is illustrated in Figure 272, in which the dimensions are\nassumed to be as follows:\nDiameter of crank shaft, 7-1/2 inches; travel of cam, 3 inches; width\nof yoke, 18 inches Fig 270 The circumference of the cam is composed of four curved lines, P, P',\nK 1, and K 2 The position of the centre of the crank shaft in this\nirregularly curved body is at X The arcs K 1 and K 2 differ in radius,\nbut are drawn from the same point, X, and hence are concentric with\nthe crank shaft The arcs P, P', are of like radius, but are drawn from the opposite\npoints S, S', shown at the intersection of the arcs P, P', with the arc K\n1 Thus arcs P, P', are eccentric to the crank shaft Fig 271 Fig 272 Fig 273 Fig 274 To draw the cam place one point of the dividers at X, which is the\ncentre of the crank shaft, and draw the circle E equal to width of\nyoke, 18 inches Through this centre X, draw the two right lines A and\nB On the line B, at the intersection of the curved line E, draw the two\nvertical lines A 1, A 1 With a radius of 10-1/2 inches, and with one\npoint of the dividers at X, draw the arc K 1 With a radius of 7-1/2\ninches, and one point of the dividers at X, draw the arc K 2 With a\nradius of 18 inches, and one point of the dividers at the intersection of\nthe arc E, with the vertical line A 1 at S, draw the arc P opposite to S,\nand let it merge or lose itself in the curved line K 2 Draw the other\ncurved line P' from the other point S, and we have a full stroke cam of\nthe dimensions required, and which is represented in Figure 273,\nremoved from the lines used in constructing it Fig 275 The engravings from and including Figure 274 illustrate the lines\nembracing cut-off cams of varying limits of cut-off, but all of like\ntravel and dimensions, which are the same as those given for the full\nstroke cam in Figure 272 In drawing cut-off cams, the stroke of the engine plays a part in\ndetermining their conformation, and in the examples shown this is\nassumed to be 4 feet Figure 274 illustrates the manner of finding\nessential points in drawing or marking out cut-off cams With X as a\ncentre, and a radius of 2 feet, draw the circle E 1, showing the path of\nthe crank-pin in making a revolution This circle has a diameter of 4\nfeet, equal to the stroke of the engine Draw the horizontal line B,\npassing through the centre of circle E 1 Within the limits of circle E 1,\nsubdivide line B into eight equal parts, as at 1, 2, 3, 4, etc Draw the\nvertical lines, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc , until they each intersect the circle E 1 With X as a centre, draw the circle E, having a diameter of 18 inches,\nequal to the space in the yoke embracing the cam From the centre X draw the series of radial lines through the points of\nintersection of the vertical lines 1, 2, 3, 4, etc , from the circle E 1,\nand terminating at X We will now proceed to utilize the scale\nafforded by Figure 274, in laying off the cut-off cam shown in Figure\n276, of half stroke limit Fig 276 Fig 277 With X as a centre, draw the circle E, Figure 275, having a diameter of\n18 inches Bisect this circle with the straight lines A and B, which bear\nthe same relation to their enclosing circle that the lines A, B, do to the\ncircle E in Figure 274 It will be observed, in Figure 274, that the vertical line A is (at the top\nhalf) also No 4, representing 4/8, or half of the stroke With a radius\nof 18 inches, and one point of the dividers placed at V, which is at the\nintersection of the circle E with the horizontal line B in Figure 275,\ndraw the arc P With the same radius and with one compass point\nrested at V', draw the arc P'; then two arcs, P and P', intersecting at\n\n\nthe point S With the same radius and one point of the compasses at S, draw the\narc H H The arcs K 1 and K 2 are drawn from the centre X, with a\nradius of 10-1/2 for K 1 and 7-1/2 inches for K 2, and only serve in a\nhalf stroke cam to intersect the curved lines already drawn, as shown\nin Figure 275 In practice, the sharp corner at S would be\nobjectionable, owing to rapid wear at this point; and hence a\nmodification of the dimensions for this half stroke cam would be\nrequired to obtain a larger wearing surface at the point S, but the cam\nof this limit (1/2 stroke) is correctly drawn by the process described\nwith reference to Figure 275, the outline of the cam so constructed\nbeing shown in Figure 276 In Figure 278 is shown a cam designed to cut off the steam at five-\neighths of the piston stroke, the construction lines being given in\nFigure 277, for which draw circle E and straight lines A and B, as in\nthe preceding example By reference to Figure 274 it will be observed\nthat the diagonal line drawn through circle E at 5 is drawn from the\nstraight line marked 5, which intersects circle E 1, and as this straight\nline 5 represents five-eighths of the stroke laid off on line B, it\ndetermines the limit of cut-off on the five-eighths cam in Figure 277 Fig 278 Fig 279 Fig 280 Turning then to Figure 274, take on circle E the radius from radial\nline 4 to radial line 5, and mark it in Figure 277 from the vertical line\nproducing V' Now, with a radius of 18 inches, and one point of the dividers fixed at\npoint V, forming the intersection of the circle E with the horizontal\nline B, draw the arc P With the same radius, and one point of the\ndividers fixed at point V', draw the opposite arc P' With a radius of\n10-1/2 inches from the centre X, draw the arc K 1, intersecting lines P\nP', at S S With a radius of 7-1/2 inches, draw the curved line K 2,\nopposite to curved line K 1 Now, with a radius of 18 inches, and one\n\n\npoint of the dividers fixed alternately at S S, draw the arcs H, H, from\ntheir intersection with the circle E, until they merge into the curved\nline K 2 These curved lines embrace a cut-off cam of five-eighths\nlimit, shown complete in Figure 278 From the instructions already given it should be easy to understand\nthat the three-fourths and seven-eighths cams, shown in Figures 279,\n280, 281 and 282, are drawn by taking the points of their cut-off from\nthe same scale shown in Figure 274, at the diagonal points 6 and 7,\nintersecting circle E in that figure; and cut-off cams of intermediate\nlimit of cut-off can be drawn by further subdividing the stroke line B,\nin Figure 274, into the required limits Fig 281 Cut-off cams of any limit are necessarily imperfect in their operations\nas to uniformity of cut-off from opposite ends of the slides, not from\nany defect in the rule for laying them off, but from the well-known\nfact of the crank pin travelling a greater distance, while driven by the\npiston from the centre of the cylinder, through its curved path from\nthe cylinder, over its centre, and back to the centre of the cylinder,\nthan in accomplishing the remaining distance of its path in making a\ncomplete revolution; and, although the subdivisions of eighths of the\nstroke line B, in Figure 274, does not truly represent a like division of\nthe piston stroke, owing to deviation, caused by inclination of the\nconnecting rod in traversing from the centres to half stroke, still it will\nbe found that laying off a cut-off cam by this rule is more nearly\ncorrect than if the divisions on stroke line B were made to correspond\nexactly with a subdivision of piston stroke into eighths",
    "Cut-off cams of any limit are necessarily imperfect in their operations\nas to uniformity of cut-off from opposite ends of the slides, not from\nany defect in the rule for laying them off, but from the well-known\nfact of the crank pin travelling a greater distance, while driven by the\npiston from the centre of the cylinder, through its curved path from\nthe cylinder, over its centre, and back to the centre of the cylinder,\nthan in accomplishing the remaining distance of its path in making a\ncomplete revolution; and, although the subdivisions of eighths of the\nstroke line B, in Figure 274, does not truly represent a like division of\nthe piston stroke, owing to deviation, caused by inclination of the\nconnecting rod in traversing from the centres to half stroke, still it will\nbe found that laying off a cut-off cam by this rule is more nearly\ncorrect than if the divisions on stroke line B were made to correspond\nexactly with a subdivision of piston stroke into eighths Fig 282 282 The cut-off in cams laid off by the rules herein described is greater in\ntravelling from one side of the slides than in travelling from the\nopposite end, one cut-off being more than the actual cut-off of piston\nstroke, and the other less; and in practical use, owing to play or lost\nmotion in the connections from cam to valve, the actual cut-off is less\nthan the theoretical; hence cut-off cams are usually laid off to\ncompensate for lost motion; that is, laid off with more limit; for\ninstance, a five-eighths cam would be laid off to cut-off at eleven-\nsixteenths instead of five-eighths",
    "The cut-off in cams laid off by the rules herein described is greater in\ntravelling from one side of the slides than in travelling from the\nopposite end, one cut-off being more than the actual cut-off of piston\nstroke, and the other less; and in practical use, owing to play or lost\nmotion in the connections from cam to valve, the actual cut-off is less\nthan the theoretical; hence cut-off cams are usually laid off to\ncompensate for lost motion; that is, laid off with more limit; for\ninstance, a five-eighths cam would be laid off to cut-off at eleven-\nsixteenths instead of five-eighths Fig 283 Figure 283 represents the motion a crank, C, imparts to a connecting\nrod, represented by the thick line R, whose end, B, is supposed to be\nguided to move in a straight line The circle H represents the path of\nthe crank-pin, and dots 1, 2, 3, etc , are 24 different crank-pin\npositions equidistant on the circle of crank-pin revolution Suppose\nthe crank-pin to have moved to position 1, and with the compasses set\nto the length of the rod R, we set one point on the centre of position\n1, and mark on the line of motion m the line a, which will be the\nposition rod end B will have moved to Suppose next that the crank-\npin has moved into position 2, and with the compass point on the\ncentre of 2 we mark line 2, showing that while the crank-pin moved\nfrom 1 to 2, the rod end moved from a to b; by continuing this process\nwe are enabled to discern the motion for the whole of the stroke The\nbackward stroke will be the same, for corresponding crank-pin\npositions, for both strokes; thus, when the rod end is at 7 the crank-\npin may be at 7 or at 17 This fact enables us to find the positions for\nthe positions later than 6, on the other side of the circle, as at 17, 16,\n15, etc , which keeps the engraving clear Fig 284 In Figure 284 a pinion, P, drives a gear-wheel, D, on which there is a\npin driving the sliding die A in the link L, which is pivoted at C, and\nconnected at its upper end to a rod, R, which is connected to a bolt, B,\nfast to a slide, S It is required to find the motion of S, it moving in a\nstraight line, dotted circle H' representing the path of the pin in the\nsliding die A, arc H representing the line of motion of the upper end\nof link L, and lines N, O, its centre line at the extreme ends of its\nvibrating motion In Figure 285 the letters of reference refer to the\nsame parts as those in Figure 284 We divide the circle H' of pin\nmotion into 24 equidistant parts marked by dots, and through these\nwe draw lines radiating from centre, C, and cutting arc H, obtaining\non the arc H the various positions for end Z of rod R, these positions\nbeing marked respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, etc , up to 24",
    ", up to 24 With a pair of\ncompasses set to the length of rod R from 1 on H, as a centre, we\nmark on the line of motion of the slide, line a, which shows where the\nother end of rod R will be (or in other words, it shows the position of\nbolt B in Figure 284), when the centre of A, Figure 284, is in position\n\n\n1, Figure 285 Fig 285 From 2 on arc H, we mark with the compasses line b on line M,\nshowing that while the pin moved from 1 to 2, the rod R would move\nslide S, Figure 284, from a to b, in Figure 285 From 3 we mark c, and\nso on, all these marks being above the horizontal line M, representing\nthe line of motion, and being for the forward stroke For the backward\nstroke we draw the dotted line from position 17 up to arc H, and with\nthe compasses at 17 mark a line beneath the line M of motion,\npursuing the same course for all the other pin motions, as 18, 19, etc ,\nuntil the pin arrives again at position 24, and the link at O, and has\nmade a full revolution, and we shall have the motion of the forward\nstroke above and that of the backward one below the line of motion of\nthe slide, and may compare the two Fig 286 Fig 287 Fig 288 Fig 289 Figures 286 and 287 represent the Whitworth quick return motion\nthat is employed in many machines F represents a frame supporting a\nfixed journal, B, on which revolves a gear-wheel, G, operated by a\npinion, P At A is an arm having journal bearing in B at C This arm is\ndriven by a pin, D, fast in the gear, G; hence as the gear revolves, pin\nD moves A around on C as a centre of motion A is provided with a\nslot carrying a pin, X, on which is pivoted the rod, R The motion of\nend N of the rod R being in a straight line, M, it is required to find the\npositions of N during twenty-four periods in one revolution of G In\nFigure 288 let H' represent the path of motion of the driving pin D,\nabout the centre of B, and H the path of motion of X about the centre\nC; these two centres corresponding to the centres of B and C\nrespectively, in Figure 287 Let the line M correspond to the line of\nmotion M in Figure 286 Now since it is the pin D, Figure 287, that\n\n\ndrives, and since its speed of revolution is uniform, we divide its circle\nof motion H' into twenty-four equal divisions, and by drawing lines\nradiating from centre C, and passing through the lines of division on\nH' we get on circle H twenty-four positions for the pin X in Figure\n286 Then setting the compasses to the length of the rod (R, Figure\n286), we mark from position 1 on circle H as a centre line, a; from\nposition 2 on H we mark line b, and so on for the whole twenty-four\npositions on circle H, obtaining from a to n for the forward, and from\nn to y for the motion during the backward stroke Suppose now that\nthe mechanism remaining precisely the same as before, the line M of\nmotion be in a line with the centres C, B, instead of at a right angle to\nit, as it is in Figure 286, and the motion under this new condition will\nbe as in Figure 289; the process for finding the amount of motion\nalong M from the motion around H being precisely as before Fig 290 In Figure 290 is shown a cutter-head for a wood moulding machine,\nand it is required to find what shape the cutting edge of the cutter\nmust be to form a moulding such as is shown in the end view of the\nmoulding in the figure Now the line A A being at a right angle to the\nline of motion of the moulding as it is passed beneath the revolving\ncutter, or, what is the same thing, at a right angle to the face of the\ntable on which the moulding is moved, it is obvious that the highest\npoint C of the moulding will be cut to shape by the point C of the\ncutter; and that since the line of motion of the end of the cutter is the\narc D, the lowest part of the cutter action upon the moulding will be\nat point E It will also be obvious that as the cutter edge passes, at\neach point, its length across the line A A, it forms the moulding to\nshape, while all the cutting action that occurs on either side of that\nline is serving simply to remove material All that we have to\nconsider, therefore, is the action on line A A",
    "All that we have to\nconsider, therefore, is the action on line A A It may be observed also that the highest point C of the cutter edge\nmust not be less than 1/4 inch from the corner of the cutter head,\nwhich gives room for the nut N (that holds the cutter to the head) to\npass over the top of the moulding in a 2-1/2 inch head In proportion\nas the heads are made larger, however, less clearance is necessary for\n\n\nthe nut, as is shown in Figure 291, the cutter edge extending to C, and\ntherefore nearly up to the corner of the head Its path of motion at C\nis shown by dotted arc B, which it will be observed amply clears the\nnut N In practice, however, point C is not in any size of cutter-head\nplaced nearer than 1/4 inch from corner X of the cutter-head To find the length of the cutter edge necessary to produce a given\ndepth of moulding, we may draw a circle i, Figure 292, equal in\ndiameter to the size of the cutter head to be used, and line A A The\nhighest point of cutting edge being at e, and the lowest at g, then\ncircles d and f represent the line of motion of these two points; and if\nwe mark the cutter in, the necessary length of cutting edge on the\ncutter is obviously from a to b Fig 291 Fig 292 Now the necessary depth of cutter edge being found for any given\nmoulding, or part of a moulding, the curves for the edge may be\nfound as follows: Suppose the moulding is to be half round, as in the\nend view in Figure 290 The width of the cutter must of course equal\nthe width of the moulding, and the length or depth of cutting edge\nrequired may be found from the construction shown in Figure 292;\nhence all that remains is to find the curve for the cutting edge In\nFigure 293, let A A represent the centre of the cutter width, its sides\nbeing F F', and its end B B From centre C draw circle D, the upper\nhalf of which will serve to represent the moulding Mark on A the\nlength or depth the cutting edge requires to be, ascertaining the same\nfrom the construction shown in Figure 292, and mark it as from C to\nK' Then draw line E E, passing through point K Draw line G, standing\nat the same angle to A A as the face h b, Figure 292, of the cutter does\nto the line A A, and draw line H H, parallel to G From any point on\nG, as at I, with radius J, draw a quarter of a circle, as K Mark off this\nquarter circle into equal points of division, as by 1, 2, 3, etc , and\nfrom these points of division draw lines, as a, b, c, etc ; and from these\nlines draw horizontal lines d, e, f, etc Now divide the lower half of\ncircle D into twice as many equal divisions as quarter circle K is\ndivided into, and from these points of division draw perpendiculars g,\nh, i, etc And where these perpendiculars cross the horizontal lines, as\nd, will be points through which the curve may be drawn, three of such\n\n\npoints being marked by dots at p, q, r If the student will, after having\ndrawn the curve by this construction, draw it by the construction that\nwas explained in connection with Figure 79, he will find the two\nmethods give so nearly identical curves, that the latter and more\nsimple method may be used without sensible error Fig 293 Fig 294 When the curves of the moulding are not arcs of circles they may be\nmarked as follows:\nTake the drawing of the moulding and divide each member or step of\nit by equidistant lines, as a, b, c, d, e, f, g, in Figure 294; above the\nmoulding draw lines representing the cutter, and having found the\ndepth of cutting edge for each member by the construction shown in\nFigure 292, finding a separate line, a b, for each member of the\nmoulding, transfer the depths so found to the face of the cutter; divide\nthe depth of each member of the cutter into as many equal divisions\nas the corresponding member of the moulding is divided into, as by\nlines h, i, j, k, l, m, n Then draw vertical lines, as o, p, q, r, etc ; and\nwhere these lines meet the respective lines h, i, j, etc , are points in\nthe curve, such points being marked on the cutter by dots CHAPTER XIII EXAMPLES IN LINE-SHADING AND DRAWINGS FOR\nLINE-SHADED ENGRAVINGS Although in workshop drawings, line-shading is rarely employed, yet\nwhere a design rather than the particular details of construction is to\nbe shown, line-shading is a valuable accessory Figure 295, for\nexample, is intended to show an arrangement of idle pulleys to guide\nbelts from one pulley to another; the principle being that so long as\nthe belt passes to a pulley moving in line with the line of rotation of\nthe pulley, the belt will run correctly, although it may leave the pulley\nat considerable angle When a belt envelops two pulleys that are at a\nright angle to each other, two guide pulleys are needed in order that\nthe belt may, in passing to each pulley, move in the same plane as the\npulley rotates in, and the belt is in this case given what is termed a\nquarter twist It will be observed that by the line-shading even the twist of the belt\nis much more clearly shown than it would be if left unshaded An excellent example of shading is given in Figure 296, which is\nextracted from the American Machinist, and represents a cutting tool\nfor a planing machine The figure is from a wood engraving, but the\neffect may be produced by lines, the black parts being considered as\nsimply broad black lines Fig 295",
    "295 The drawings from which engravings are made are drawn to conform\nto the process by which the engraving is to be produced Drawings\nthat are shaded by plain lines may be engraved by three methods First, the drawing may be photo-engraved, in which process the\ndrawing is photographed on the metal, and every line appears in the\nengraving precisely as it appears in the drawing Fig 296 For this kind of engraving the drawing may be made of any\nconvenient size that is larger than the size of engraving to be\nproduced, the reduction of size being produced in the photographing\nprocess Drawings for photo-engraving require to have the lines jet\nblack, and it is to be remembered that if red centrelines are marked\non the drawing, they will be produced as ordinary black lines in the\nengraving The shading on a drawing to be photo-engraved must be produced by\nlines, and not by tints, for tints, whether of black or of colors, will not\nphoto-engrave properly It is generally preferred to make the drawing for a photo-engraving\nlarger than the engraving that is to be made from it, a good\nproportion being to make the drawing twice the length the engraving\nis to be This serves to reduce the magnitude of any roughness in the\nlines of the drawing, and, therefore, to make the engraving better\nthan the drawing The thickness of the lines in the drawing should be made to suit the\namount of reduction to be made, because the lines are reduced in\nthickness in the same proportion as the engraving is reduced from the\ndrawing Thus the lines on an engraving reduced to one-half the\ndimensions of the drawing would be one-half as thick as the lines on\nthe drawing Drawings for photo-engraving should be made on smooth-faced paper;\nas, for example, on Bristol board; and to make the lines clean and\nclear, the drawing instruments should be in the best of condition, and\nthe paper or Bristol board quite dry The India rubber should be used\nas little as possible on drawings to be photo-engraved, because, if used\nbefore the lines are inked in, it roughens the surface of the paper, and\nthe inking lines will be less smooth and even at their edges; and for\nthis reason it is better not to rub out any lines until all the lines have\nbeen inked in If used to excess after the lines have been inked in it\nserves to reduce the blackness of the lines, and may so pale them that\nthey will not properly photo-engrave To make a drawing for an engraver in wood it would be drawn\ndirectly on the face of the box-wood block, on which it is to be\n\n\nengraved The surface of the block is first whitened by a white water\ncolor, as Chinese white If the drawing that is to be used as a copy is\non sufficiently thin paper, its outline may be traced over by pencil\nlines, and the copy may then be laid face down on the wood block\nand its edges held to the block by wax, the pencilled lines being face\nto the block The outline may then be again traced over with a pencil\nor pointed instrument, causing the imprint of the lead pencil lines to\nbe left on the whitened surface of the block If the copy is on paper\ntoo thick to be thus employed, a tracing may be made and used as\nabove; it being borne in mind that the tracing must be laid with the\npencilled lines on the block, because what is the right hand of the\ndrawing on the block is the left hand in the print it gives The shading\non wood blocks is given by tints of India ink aided by pencilled lines,\nor of course pencilled lines only may for less artistic work be used Another method is to photograph the drawing direct upon the surface\nof the wood block; it is unnecessary, however, to enter into this part\nof the subject The third method of producing an engraving from a drawing is by\nmeans of what is known as the wax process Drawings for this process\nshould be made on thin paper, for the following reasons: The process\nconsists, briefly stated, in coating a copper plate with a layer of wax\nabout 1/32 inch deep, and in drawing upon the wax the lines to\ncompose the engraving, which lines are produced by means of tools\nthat remove the wax down to the surface of the copper The plate and wax are then placed in a battery and a deposit of\ncopper fills in the lines and surface of the wax, thus forming the\nengraving Now if the drawing is made on thin paper, the engraver\ncoats the surface of the drawing with a dry red pigment, and with a\npointed instrument traces over the lines of the drawing, which causes\nthem to leave a red imprint on the surface of the wax, and after the\ndrawing is removed the engraver cuts these imprinted lines in the\nwax If the drawing is on thick paper, this method of transferring the\ndrawing to the wax cannot be used, and the engraver may take a\ntracing from the drawing and transfer from the tracing to the wax It\nis obvious, also, that for wax engravings the drawing should be made\nof the same size that the engraving is required to be, or otherwise the\ntracing process described cannot be used Figure 297 represents an\nengraving made by the wax process from a print from a wood\nengraving, and it is obvious that since all the lines drawn on the wax\n\n\nsink down to the surface of the copper plate, the shading is virtually\ncomposed of lines, the black surfaces being where the lines have been\nsufficiently close together and broad to remove all the wax enclosed\nwithin those surfaces Fig 297 Fig 298",
    "298 The wax process is, however, more suitable for engravings in plain\noutline only, and is especially excellent when the parts are small and\nthe lines fall close together; as, for example, in Figures 298 and 299,\nwhich are engravings of a boiler drilling machine, and were produced\nfor the American Machinist by tracing over a wood engraving from\nLondon, \"Engineering\" in the manner already described The fineness\nand cleanness of the lines in the wax process is here well illustrated,\nthe disposition of the parts being easily seen from the engraving, and\neasily followed in connection with the following description:\nThe machine consists of two horizontal bed-plates A 1 and A 2, made\nwith V slides on top, and placed at right angles to each other Upon\neach of the bed-plates is fitted a vertical arm B 1 and B 2, each of\nwhich carries two saddles, C 1 and C 2, these being each adjustable\nvertically on its respective arm by means of rack and pinion and hand\nwheels D 1 and D 2 The saddles are balanced so that the least\npossible exertion is sufficient to adjust them The vertical arms, B 1\nand B 2, are cast each with a round foot by which the arms are\nattached to the square boxes E 1 and E 2, which are fitted to the V\nslides on the horizontal beds A 1 and A 2, and are adjustable thereon\nby means of screw and ratchet motion F 1 and F 2 Each of the square\nboxes has cast on it a small arm G 1 and G 2, carrying studs upon\nwhich run pinions gearing into the circular racks at the foot of the\nvertical arms The square boxes have each a circular groove turned in\nthe top to receive the bolts by which the vertical arms are connected\nto them, and thus the vertical arms, and with them the drill spindles N\n\n\n1 and N 2, are adjustable radially with the boiler—the adjustment\nbeing effected by means of the pinions and circular racks The pinions\nare arranged so that they can be worked with the same screw key that\nis used for the bolts in the circular grooves The shell to be drilled is placed upon the circular table H, which is\ncarried by suitable framework adjustable by means of screw on a V\nslide I, placed at an angle of 45° with the horizontal bed-plates By\nthis arrangement, when the table is moved along I, it will approach to\nor recede from all the drills equally J 1 and J 2 are girders forming\nadditional bearings for the framework of the table The bed-plates and\nslides for the table are bolted and braced together, making the whole\nmachine very firm and rigid Power is applied to the machine through\nthe cones K 1 and K 2, working the horizontal and vertical shafts L 1\nand L 2, etc On the vertical shafts are fitted coarse pitch worms\nsliding on feather keys, and carried with the saddles C 1 and C 2, etc The worms gearing with the worm wheels M 1 and M 2 are fitted on\nthe sleeves of the steel spindles N 1 and N 2 The spindles are fitted\nwith self-acting motions O 1 and O 2, which are easily thrown in and\nout of gear The machine is also used for turning the edge of the flanges which\nsome makers prefer to have on the end plates of marine boilers The\nplates are very readily fixed to the circular table H, and the edge of\nthe flange trued up much quicker than by the ordinary means of\nchipping When the machine is used for this purpose, the cross beam\nP, which is removable, is fastened to the two upright brackets R 1 and\nR 2 The cross beam is cast with V slides at one side for a little more\nthan half its length from one end, and on the opposite side for the\nsame length, but from the opposite end The V slides are each fitted\nwith a tool box S 1 and S 2, having a screw adjustment for setting the\ntool to the depth of cut, and adjustable on the V slides of the cross\nbeam to the diameter of the plate to be turned This arrangement of\nthe machine is also used for cutting out the furnace mouths in the\nboiler ends The plate is fastened to the circular table, the centre of\nthe hole to be cut out being placed over the centre of table; one or\nboth of the tool boxes may be used There is sufficient space between\nthe upright brackets R 1 and R 2, to allow that section of a boiler end\nwhich contains the furnace mouths to revolve while the holes are\nbeing cut out; the plate belonging to the end of a boiler of the largest\ndiameter that the machine will take in for drilling The holes cut out\n\n\nwill be from 2 feet 3 inches in diameter and upwards",
    "The holes cut out\n\n\nwill be from 2 feet 3 inches in diameter and upwards Power for using\nthe turntable is applied through the cone T The bevel wheels, worms,\nworm wheels, and pinions for driving the tables are of cast steel,\nwhich is necessary for the rough work of turning the flanges Fig 299 (Page 275 )\nAs to the practical results of using the machine, the drills are driven at\na speed of 340 feet per minute at the cutting edges A jet of soapsuds\nplays on each drill from an orifice 1/32 in in diameter, and at a\npressure of 60 lbs per square inch A joint composed of two 1-inch\nplates, and having holes 1 and one-eighth in in diameter, can be\ndrilled in about 2-1/2 minutes, and allowing about half a minute for\nadjusting the drill, each drill will do about 20 holes per hour The\nmachine is designed to stand any amount of work that the drills will\nbear The time required for putting on the end of a boiler and turning\nthe flange thereon (say 14 feet diameter) is about 2-1/2 hours; much,\nhowever, depends on the state of the flanges, as sometimes they are\nvery rough, while at others very little is necessary to true them up The time required for putting on the plate containing the furnace\nmouths and cutting out three holes 2 feet 6 in in diameter, the plate\nbeing 1 and one-eighth in thick, is three hours Of course, if several\nboilers of one size are being made at the same time, the holes in two\nor more of these plates can be cut out at once The machine is of such\ndesign that it can be placed with one of the horizontal bed-plates (say\nA 1), parallel and close up to a wall of the boiler shop; and when the\nturning apparatus is being used, the vertical arm B 2 can be swiveled\nhalf way round on its square box E 2, and used for drilling and\ntapping the stay holes in marine boiler ends after they are put\ntogether; of course sufficient room must be left between bed-plate A 2,\nand the wall of boiler shop parallel with it, to allow for reception of\nthe boiler to be operated upon It would obviously be quite difficult to draw such drawings as in\nFigures 298 and 299 on thin paper, so as to enable the drawing to be\ntraced on the wax direct by the process before described, unless\nindeed the draftsman had considerable experience in fine work;\nhence, it is not uncommon to make the drawing large, and on\n\n\nordinary drawing paper The engraver then has the drawing\nphotographed on the surface of the wax, and works to the\nphotograph The letters of reference in wax engravings are put in by\nimpressing type in the wax, and in this connection it may be remarked\nthat the letters I and O should not be used on drawings to be engraved\nby the wax process, unless they are situated outside the outlines of the\ndrawing, because the I looks so much like part of a dotted line that it\nis often indistinguishable therefrom, while the O looks like a circle or\nan ellipse CHAPTER XIV SHADING AND COLORING DRAWINGS The shading or coloring of drawings by tints is more employed in\nlarge drawings than in small ones, and in Europe than in the United\nStates; while on the other hand tinting by means of line-shading is\nmore employed in the United States than in Europe, and more on\nsmall drawings than on large ones Many draftsmen adopt the plan of coloring the journals of shafts, etc ,\nwith a light tint, giving them the deepest tint at the circumference to\ngive them a cylindrical appearance This makes the drawing much\nclearer and takes but little time to do, and is especially advantageous\nwhere the parts are small or on a small scale, so that the lines are\ncomparatively close together For simple shading purposes black tints of various degrees of darkness\nmay be employed, but it is usual to tint brass work with yellow Cast\niron with India ink, wrought iron with Prussian blue, steel with as\nlight purple tint produced by mixing India ink, Prussian blue and a\ntinge of crimson lake Copper is tinted red On plane surfaces an even\ntint of color is laid, but if the surfaces are cylindrical they are usually\ncolored deeper at and near the circumference, and are tinted over the\ncolors with light tints of India ink to show their cylindrical form If a drawing is to be colored or shaded with India ink the paper\nshould be glued all around its edges to the drawing board, and then\ndampened evenly all over with a sponge, which will cause the paper\nto shrink and lay close to the surface of the drawing board If, in\napplying a color or a tint, the color dries before the whole surface is\ncolored, the color will not be of an equal shade; hence it is necessary\nbefore applying the color to dampen the surface, if it is a large one, so\nthat the color at one part shall not get dry before there has been time\nto go over the whole surface; a more even depth of color is attained\nby the application of several coats of a light tint, than with one coat,\ngiving the full depth of color But if the paper is not allowed to dry\nsufficiently between the coats, or if it has been made too wet previous\nto the application of the colors, it will run in places, leaving other\n\n\nhollows into which the color will flow, making darker-colored spots To avoid this the paper may be dried somewhat by the application of\nclean blotting paper To maintain an even shade of color, it is necessary to slightly stir up\nthe color each time the brush is dipped into the color saucer or\npalette, especially when the coloring is composed of mixed colors,\nbecause the coloring matter is apt to separate from the water and sink\nto the bottom So, also, in mixing colors it is best to apply the end of the color to the\nsurface of the palette and not to apply the brush direct to the cake of\ncolor, because the color is more completely mixed by contact with the\npalette than it can be by the brush, which may retain a speck of color\nthat will, unless washed out, make a streak upon the drawing To graduate the depth of tint for a cylindrical surface, it is best to mix\nseveral, as, say three depths or degrees of tint, and to first use the\ndarkest, applying it in the direction in which the piece is to be shaded\ndarkest The width this dark application should be is obviously\ndetermined by the diameter of the piece The next operation is to\nlighten or draw the part, line or streak thus dark colored, causing it to\nget paler and paler as it approaches the axial line of the piece or\ncylinder This lightening is accomplished as follows: The dark streak is\napplied along such a length of the piece that it will not dry before\nthere has been time to draw it out or lighten it on the side towards the\naxis A separate brush may then be wetted and drawn along the edge\nof the dark streak in short strokes, causing the color to run outwards\nand become lighter as it approaches the axis It will be found that\nduring this process the brush will occasionally require washing in\nwater, because from continuous contact with the dark streak the tint it\ncontains will darken When the first coat has been laid and spread or\ndrawn out from end to end of the piece, the process may be repeated\ntwo or three times, the most even results being obtained by making\nthe first dark streak not too dark, and going over the drawing several\ntimes, but allowing the paper to get very nearly dry between each\ncoat In small cylindrical bodies, as, say 1/4 inch in diameter, the\ndarkest line of shadow may be located at the lines representing the\ndiameter of the piece, but in pieces of larger diameter the darkest line\nmay be located at a short distance from the line that denotes the\ndiameter or perimeter on the shadow or right-hand side of the piece,\n\n\nas is shown in many of the engravings that follow It is obvious that if\na drawing is to have dimensions marked on it, the coloring or tinting\nshould not be deep enough to make it difficult to see the dimension\nfigures The size of the brush to be used depends, of course, upon the size of\nthe piece to be shaded or colored, and it is best to keep one brush for\nthe dark tint and to never let the brush dry with the tint in it, as this\nmakes it harsh In a good brush the hairs are fine, lie close together\nwhen moistened, are smooth and yet sufficiently stiff or elastic to\nbend back slightly when the pressure is removed If, when under\npressure and nearly dry, the hairs will separate or the brush has no\nelasticity in it, good results cannot be obtained All brushes should be\nwell dried after use The light in shading is supposed to come in at the left-hand corner of\nthe drawing, as was explained with reference to the shade line Excellent examples to copy and shade with the brush are given as\nfollows:\nFigure 300 represents a Medart pulley, constructed by the Hartford\nSteam Engineering Company; the arms and hub are cast in one piece,\nand the rim is a wrought iron band riveted to the arms, whose ends\nare turned or ground true with the hub bore The figure is obviously a\nwood engraving, but it presents the varying degrees of shade or\nshadow with sufficient accuracy to form a good example to copy and\nbrush shade with India ink Figure 301 represents a similar pulley\nwith a double set of arms, forming an excellent example in\nperspective drawing, as well as for brush-shading Fig 300 In brush-shading as with line-shading, the difficulties increase with an\nincrease in the size of the piece, and the learner will find that after he\nhas succeeded tolerably well in shading these small pulleys, it will be\nquite difficult, but excellent practice to shade the large pulley in\nFigure 302 One of the principal considerations is to not let the color dry at the\nedges in one part while continuing the shading in another part of the\nsame surface, hence it is best to begin at the edge or outline of the\ndrawing and carry the work forward as quickly as possible,\noccasionally slightly wetting with water edges that require to be left\nwhile the shading is proceeding in another direction",
    "One of the principal considerations is to not let the color dry at the\nedges in one part while continuing the shading in another part of the\nsame surface, hence it is best to begin at the edge or outline of the\ndrawing and carry the work forward as quickly as possible,\noccasionally slightly wetting with water edges that require to be left\nwhile the shading is proceeding in another direction Fig 301 When it is required to show by the shading that the surfaces are\nhighly polished, the lighter parts of the shading are made to contain\nwhat may be termed splashes of lighter and darker shadow, as in\nFigure 303, which represents an oil cup, having a brass casing\nenclosing a glass cylinder, which appears through the openings in the\nbrass shell Figure 304 represents an iron planing machine whose line-shading is\nso evenly effected that it affords an excellent example of shading Its\nparts are similar to those shown in the iron planer in Figure 297, save\nthat it carries two sliding heads, so as to enable the use,\nsimultaneously, of two cutting tools Fig 302 A superior example in shading is shown in Figures 305 and 306,\nwhich represent a plan and a sectional view of the steam-cylinder of a\nBlake's patent direct-acting steam-pump The construction of the parts\n\n\nis as follows: A is the steam-piston, H 1 and H are the cylinder steam-\npassages; M is the cylinder exhaust port The construction of the parts\n\n\nis as follows: A is the steam-piston, H 1 and H are the cylinder steam-\npassages; M is the cylinder exhaust port Fig 303 Fig 304 (Page 282 )\nFig 305 The main valve, whose movement alternately opens the ports for the\nadmission of steam to, and the escape of steam from, the main\ncylinder, is divided into two parts, one of which, C, slides upon a seat\non the main cylinder, and at the same time affords a seat for the other\npart, D, which slides upon the upper face of C As shown in the\nengravings, D is at the left-hand end of its stroke, and C at the\nopposite or right-hand end of its stroke Steam from the steam-chest,\nJ, is therefore entering the right-hand end of the main cylinder\nthrough the ports E and H, and the exhaust is escaping through the\nports H 1, E 1, K and M, which causes the main piston A to move from\nright to left When this piston has nearly reached the left-hand end of\nits cylinder, the tappet arm, T, attached to the piston-rod, comes in\ncontact with, and moves the valve rod collar O 1 and valve rod P, and\nthus causes C, together with the supplemental valves R and S S 1,\nwhich form, with C, one casting, to be moved from right to left This\nmovement causes steam to be admitted to the left-hand end of the\nsupplemental cylinder, whereby its piston B will be forced towards the\nright, carrying D to the opposite or right-hand end of its stroke; for\nthe movement of S closes N (the steam-port leading to the right-hand\nend), and the movement of S 1 opens N 1 (the steam-port leading to\nthe opposite or left-hand end), at the same time the movement of V\nopens the right-hand end of this cylinder to the exhaust, through the\n\n\nexhaust ports X and Z The parts C and D now have positions opposite\nto those shown in the engravings, and steam is therefore entering the\nmain cylinder through the ports E 1 and H 1, and escaping through\nthe ports H, E, K and M, which causes the main piston A to move in\nthe opposite direction, or from left to right, and operations similar to\nthose already described will follow, when the piston approaches the\nright-hand end of its cylinder By this simple arrangement the pump is\nrendered positive in its action; that is, it will instantly start and\ncontinue working the moment steam is admitted to the steam-chest,\nwhile at the same time the piston is enabled to move as slowly as the\nnature of the duty may require It will be noted that in Figure 305, the\nports of C are shown through D, whose location is marked by dark\nshading This obviously is not correct, because D being above C\nshould be shaded lighter than C, and again the ports E 1 and K could\nnot show dark through the port D They might, of course, be shown by\ndotted outlines, but they would not appear to such advantage, and on\nthis account it is permissible where artistic effect is sought, the object\nbeing to subserve the shading to making the mechanism and its\noperation clearly and readily understood Fig 306 Figure 307 affords another excellent example for shading It consists\nof an independent condenser, whose steam-cylinder and valve\nmechanism is the same as that described with reference to Figures\n305 and 306",

    "This construction admits of the\nvalve leaving the seat, if necessary, to relieve the cylinder from water,\nas in the instance of priming, and also, by the reduction of these\npieces, admits of ready adjustment to contact, should it become\nnecessary Fig 311—Valve Motion The cover plate is provided with recesses on its inner surface which\nexactly correspond with the ports in the valve face, and the\ncorresponding ports and recesses are kept in communication with\neach other by means of relief passages in the valve From this it will\nbe seen that the valve is subjected to equal and balanced pressure on\neach of its sides, and hence, is in equilibrium The valve is operated through the valve motion, shown in Figure 311,\nthe eccentric rod of which hooks on a slightly tapered block that turns\non the pin of the rock arm, like an ordinary journal box The expansion, or cut-off, is automatically regulated by the operation\nof the governor in swinging the slotted eccentric in a manner\nsubstantially equivalent to moving it across the shaft, but is however\nfavorably modified by the arrangement of the rock arm, which, in\ncombination with the other motions, neutralizes the unfavorable\noperation of the usual shifting eccentric, and which, in connection\nwith the large double port opening, provides for a good use of steam\nfrom 0 to 3/4 stroke The governor shown in Figure 312 is of the disc and single ball type,\nthe centrifugal force of the ball being counteracted by a powerful\nspring Friction is reduced to a minimum in the governor connection,\nby introducing steel rollers and hardened steel plates in such a\nmanner as to provide rolling instead of sliding motion In order that a governor shall correctly perform its functions, it is\n\n\nunquestionably necessary that it have power largely in excess of the\nwork required of it, and also that the friction shall represent a very\nlow percentage of that power In respect to this, especial means have\nbeen employed to reduce the friction; the valve being balanced,\nrequires but little power to move it, while the governor ball being\nmade heavy for the purpose of counterbalancing the weight of the\neccentric and strap, its centrifugal force when the engine is at full\nspeed is enormous, the spring to counteract it having to sustain from\ntwo to three thousand pounds Under these circumstances, as might be\nexpected, the regulation is remarkably good This is a very important\nconsideration in an engine working under the conditions of a roll-\ntrain engine",
    "This is a very important\nconsideration in an engine working under the conditions of a roll-\ntrain engine Fig 312—Governor Fig 313—Section of Pillow Block Figure 313 represents a section of the pillow block box, crank-pin and\nwheel, together with the main journal It will be seen that the end of\nthe box next the crank wheel has a circular groove around its outside,\nand that a corresponding groove in the crank wheel projects over this\ngroove From this latter groove an oil hole of liberal size extends, as\nshown, to the surface of the crank-pin Any oil placed at the upper\npart of the groove on the box finds its way by gravity into the groove\nin the crank wheel, and is carried by centrifugal force to the outside\nsurface of the crank-pin; so that whatever other means of lubrication\nmay be employed, this one will always be positive in its action This\ncut also shows the manner in which the box overlaps the main journal\nand forms the oil reservoir This\ncut also shows the manner in which the box overlaps the main journal\nand forms the oil reservoir Fig 314—Connecting Rod (Page 295 (Page 295 )\n\n\nAnother feature in the construction of this box is the means by which\nit is made to adjust itself in line with the shaft It will be observed that\nit rests on the bottom of the jaws of the frame on two inclined\nsurfaces, which form equal angles with the axis of the shaft when in\nits normal position, and that by moving longitudinally in either\ndirection, as may be necessary, the box will accommodate itself to a\nchange in the alignment of the shaft In order that it may be free to\nmove for this purpose it is not fitted with the usual fore and aft\nflanges By this means any slight derangement, as in either the\noutboard or inboard bearing wearing down the fastest, is taken care\nof, the movement of the box on the inclined surfaces being for this\npurpose equivalent to the operation of a ball and socket bearing Figure 314 gives a side and an edge view of the connecting rod, the\nrod being in section in the edge view, and the brasses in section lined\nin both views The cross-head pin, it will be observed, is tapered, and is drawn home\nin the cross-head by a bolt; the sides of the pin are flattened\nsomewhat where the journal is, so that the pin may not wear oval, as\nit is apt to do, because of the pull and thrust strain of the rod brasses\nfalling mainly upon the top and bottom of the journal, where the most\nwear therefore takes place The brasses at the crossed end are set up\nby a wedge adjustable by means of the screw bolts shown The cross-\nhead wrist pin being removable from the cross-head enables the upper\nend of the rod to have a solid end, since it can be passed into place in\nthe crossed and the wrist pin inserted through the two The lower\nends of the connecting-rod and the crank-pin possess a peculiar\nfeature, inasmuch as by enlarging the diameter of the crank-pin, the\nends of the brasses overlap, to a certain extent, the ends of the\njournal, thus holding the oil and affording increased lubrication The\nsegments that partly envelop the cross-head pin and crank-pin, and\nare section lined in two directions, producing crossing section lines, or\nsmall squares, show that the brasses are lined with babbitt metal,\nwhich is represented by this kind of cross-hatching These drawings\nare sufficiently open and clear to form very good examples to copy\nand to trace on tracing paper Fig 315 (Page 296 )\nFig 316 Fig 317 Figures 315, 316 and 317 represent, in place upon its setting, a 200\nhorse-power horizontal steam-boiler for a stationary engine, and are\nthe design of William H Hoffman The cross-sectional view of the\nboiler shell in Figure 315 shows the arrangement of the tubes, which,\nhaving clear or unobstructed passages between the vertical rows of\ntubes, permits the steam to rise freely and assists the circulation of the\nwater The dry pipe (which is also shown in Figure 316) is a\nperforated pipe through which the steam passes to the engine\ncylinder, its object being to carry off the steam as dry as possible; that\nis to say, without its carrying away with the steam any entrained\nwater that may be held in suspension Figure 316 is a side elevation\nwith the setting shown in section, and Figure 317 is an end view of\nthe boiler and setting at the furnace end The boiler is supported on\neach side by channel iron columns, these being riveted to the boiler\nshell angle pieces which rest upon the columns The heat and products\nof combustion pass from the furnace along the bottom of the boiler,\nand at the end pass into and through the tubes and thence over the\ntop of the boiler to the chimney flue There is shown in the bridge\nwall an opening, and its service is to admit air to the gases after they\nhave passed the bridge wall, and thus complete the combustion of\nsuch gases as may have remained unconsumed in the furnace The\ncleansing door at one end and that lined with asbestos at the other,\nare to admit the passage of the tube cleaners The asbestos at the top\nof the boiler shell is to protect it from any undue rise in temperature,\nsteam being a poorer conductor of heat than water, and it being\nobvious that if one side of the boiler is hotter than the other it\nexpands more from the heat and becomes longer, causing the boiler to\n\n\nbend, which strains and weakens it The sides of the setting are\ncomposed of a double row of brick walls with an air space of three\ninches between them, the object being to prevent as far as possible the\nradiation of heat from the walls The brick-staves are simply stays to\nhold the brick work together and prevent its cracking, as it is apt, in\nthe absence of staying, to do Fig 318 (P\nFigures from 318 to 330 are working drawings of a 100-horse engine,\ndesigned also by William H Hoffman Figure 318 represents a plan and a side view of the bed-plate with the\nmain bearing and the guide bars in place The cylinder is bolted at the\nstuffing box end to the bed-plate, and is supported at the outer end by\nan expansion link pivoted to the bed-plate The main bearing is\nprovided with a screw for adjusting the height of the bottom piece of\nthe bearing, and thus taking up the wear The guide bars are held to\nthe bed in the middle as well as at each end Figures 319 and 320 represent cross sections of the bed-plate Fig 319—Cross Section of Bed Plate near Junction with Cylinder (Page 299 )\nFig 320\nFigure 321 represents a side elevation of the cylinder, and Figure 322\nan end view of the same, the expansion support being for the purpose\nof permitting the cylinder to expand and contract under variations of\ntemperature without acting to bend the bed-plate, while at the same\ntime the cylinder is supported at both ends The cylinder and cylinder\ncovers are jacketted with live steam in the steam-spaces shown",
