    "### **Dark Matter, Mass Scales Sequence, and Superstructure** **in the Universe (with extension and summary)**\n\nWuliang Huang\n\n\nInstitute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences,\n\nP O Box 918(3), Beijing 100049, China\n\n\nXiaodong Huang\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095, U S A **Abstract**\nThe original intention of the first version of this paper is to search for the mass rang\nof dark matter particles (fermions or bosons) _m_ according to the material state equations in _d_\n\nthe evolved universe It shows the mass rang of _m_ is around _d_ 10 [] 1 _eV_, i e into H\ndecoupling area The dark matter particles with low (light) mass are related to the\nsuperstructure and belong to a mass scale sequence in the universe The cosmic structure is\nnot only from primary perturbation of early universe but also from perturbation and Jeans\ndensity wave of dark matter in the superstructure The environment inside superstructure\n(SS) speed up the formation of sub-structure in SS by H-decoupling period The environment inside superstructure\n(SS) speed up the formation of sub-structure in SS by H-decoupling period If dark matter is\ndominated by bosons, the cosmology principle is needed; if dark matter is dominated by\nfermions, it tends to spherical universe (finite universe) The second section (extension section) of this paper describes the extension of the\nmass scales sequence (mass tree) and describes new particles ( _u_ -particle, Planck particle,\n\n_A_ -particle,  -particle, _graviton_,  -particle, heavy electron…) This can be used to\nexplore the state of matter with super-high density, inflation, lightest black hole (LBH),\nBSM, CGB etc in the early universe Measuring the rate of change of _c_ and  at the present\ntime is one way to check whether the cosmological constant/dark energy exists or not The third section of this paper is a summary From mass tree, the evolution of the\nuniverse is described by three stages: chaos, inflation and expansion The first two stages\nhave _c_ mutations and the inflation appears as a step by step fission process of black holes The dark matter particles with low mass (  and  ) are described in a dual/two-fold SM\nwith new symmetry and new interaction, and  -particle is like inert neutrino but has\nbaryon number (L-B conservation) We emphasize how to search for  -particle, how to\nresearch critical energy, critical density  _cr_, background particles, and spherical universe  _cr_ relates to a type of pseudo-balance black holes/celestial bodies Minimum black hole\n\nradius _r_ min  _[r]_ _p_ means we live in a sphere universe, which belong to a big universe, mainly\ncharacterized by proton It appears in a new manner for the super-high energy physics,\nwhich may determine the applicable region for the modern physics including relativity PACS numbers: 95 35 +d, 98 65 D, 98 80

be put\ninto the category of dark matter) Dark matter particles _d_ (mass _m_ _d_ ) could be\nfermions _f_ with mass _m_ _f_ or bosons _b_ with mass _m_ _b_ Because _e_ and  make\nonly a small contribution to the total mass of the universe at the present time,\nwe are confronted with a multi-component ( _n_  _d_ ) universe, in which the\ntypical mass scale is the solar mass _M_ On the other hand, from the \nfundamental physical constants (except electric charge) the speed of light _c_,\nthe gravitation constant _G_ and the Planck constant, a mass scale\n\n\n(Planck mass): _m_ _pl_

a\ndegenerate system composed of neutral nucleons (fermions) Inside the\nneutron star, the boundary momentum of fermions comes to the maximum\nvalue _m_ _n_ _c_ At this time the total number of

_m_ _f_ is indeed ~10 [] [1] _eV_ However, the maximum scale of superstructures from observations is\n\n~10 [3] _Mpc_ [[6]], corresponding to a typical mass scale _M_ _F_ mentioned above The\nsuperstructures appeared during H-decoupling, when _m_ _f_ ~10 [] [1] _eV_ Once a\nsuperstructure has broken away from the cosmic expansion, the inner\nenvironment is like a quasi-static universe Thus, celestial bodies with\ndifferent scales originating from various cosmic perturbations were rapidly\nproduced in the superstructure [ In the formation of celestial bodies, one of 9]\nthe essential conditions is that the particles of cosmic medium must be in a\nnon-relativistic state with an average thermal velocity ~~_v_~~ ~ _v_ _s_ ~ 0 1 _c_ From\nEq (6) and Eq (7), we know at this time _z_ is ~ 10, and may be near the time\nthat superstructures broke away from the cosmic expansion Thus, the\nexistence of stable NBDMP with mass ~10 [] [1] _eV_ is not in contradiction with\nthe recent report about the existence of galaxies at large redshift _z_ ~10 [[10]] Another way to calculate the matter state of the _f_ -particle is to substitute\nthe evolutionary equation of

is related to the superstructure of the\nuniverse These particles are fermions or bosons In either case, we deduced\nthat the particle mass is ~ 10  1 _eV_ and the absolute value of its chemical\n\n1\npotential is  10 [] _eV_ These results are not in contradiction with the\nexistence of galaxies at large red shift _z_ ~ 10, nor with the dip phenomena of\nthe ultra-high energy primary cosmic ray spectrum at ~ 10 15 _eV_ (“knee”)\ncorresponding to fermion NBDMP  and at ~ 10 18 _eV_ (“ankle”)\ncorresponding to boson NBDMP ** _or to the fourth stable elementary particle -_\n_fermion_  _ If dark matter is dominated by bosons, cosmological principle is necessary _\n_If dark matter is dominated by fermions, it favors the spherical universe theory_ (2) This\npaper is consistent with our previous works [8],[12],[13] If the NBDMP with mass\n~ 10  1 _eV_ do exist in the universe, they can be used to explain the large scale\nstream [ and the filament 8] [12] in the universe, as well as the flatness of the\nrotational velocity distribution in spiral galaxies [13] (3) If the _f_ -particles are\nneutrinos, the neutrino mass is also ~ 10  1 _eV_ [14] since the value of _m_ is not _f_\nsensitive to parameter  _f_ (4) If the superstructure scale _M_ indeed exists in _F_\nthe universe, the cosmology principle must be based on superstructures Therefore, the observed value of the Hubble constant _H_ and the _o_\ncosmological constant  must take into consideration the influence of the\nsuperstructure _M_ That is, the value of _F_  from the data about the SNe\nIa [15] could still be equal to zero [16] (5) The concept of large number was\nintroduced by P",

 1 _eV_ ) [11] During the cooling process of LBH (and also of the collision fire\nball in laboratory), if a lot of electrons are created before protons, the Dual SM is more\nsupported #### Search for  -particle\n\n(1)According to Dual SM/two-fold SM, the  particle is like an inert neutrino but with a\nbaryon number We may use high energy protons (>0 5 TeV) to collide carbon/beryllium\ntargets to produce  particles Another option is to refer the equipment that was used to\nsearch for cosmic neutrinos (2)For the ultra-high energy primary cosmic ray spectrum (UEPCRS), the “knee” could\nbe related to the interaction between proton and _C_  _B_ : ( _p_  / ~~~~  ~~_e_~~  _n_ / ~~_n_~~ ) and the\n“ankle” could be related to the interaction between proton and _C_  _B_ :\n( _p_  /   _p_  _n_ / ~~_n_~~ ) If space electron spectrum is correlated with UEPCRS, it will\nappear as two abnormalities by 10 0 _TeV_ and 10 2 _TeV_ The latter is related to  particle [17]\nBesides, for cosmic ultra-high energy particles (such as   ), the key is the production\n\nof ultra-high energy neutrons, which may be created in the interaction process of  and _p_ (3) If we deduce the influence of photons-baryons from CMB anisotropy spectrum, then\nit may reflect the mass spectrum of  particles and  particles (4)Based on the mass tree, it is preferable to look for  -particles in galaxy-clusters #### Critical density  cr and critical energy E cr\n\nThe energy scale at _R_ is the critical energy 4 _E_, and _cr_  _cr_ ~ _A_ 2   _p_ ~  1 in which\n\n\n\n _p_ ~ _m_ 3 _p_ From  _cr_ we have _E_ _cr_ ~ ( _m_ 2 _p_ _c_ 9  _G_  1 ) 1/ 4 ~ 10 18 _eV_, which is like the cutoff of\n\n\n\n~ _p_\n\n_p_ 3\n_r_\n\n\n\n~\n3\n\n\n\n_p_\n\n\n\nrenormalization At _E_, when LBH are produced, the boundaries of elementary particles _cr_\n\nfor SM or BSM in our spherical universe have disappeared Without skin, where do the\nhairs adhere So, This means that the interacted fields are also “disappeared” (unified) When the density at the center of a black hole became  _cr_, the total mass and total\n\ngravitation of the black hole appear unchanged while accretion is processing It is a type\nof pseudo-balance black holes/celestial bodies 17\n\n\n#### Minimum black hole radius r min and LBH\n\nProton is an elementary particle with complex structure but so stable, we adopt _r_ min  _[r]_ _p_\nmeans we live in a sphere universe, which belong to a big universe, mainly characterized by\nproton One can adopt different _r_ min and that is corresponding to a different spherical\n\nuniverse and so on LBHs play a special effect in inflation process and at beginning of expansion process for\ncosmic evolution Super heavy particle _m_ 1 is a puzzle **Spherical universe**\n(1) GRBs Ring, multi-components universe and pancake Recently it was reported a giant ring-like structure with a diameter of 1 7 Gpc\ndisplayed by GRBs [16] This giant ring can be explained by pancake process in a\n(B+  ) two components superstructure [, 4] _m_  ~ 10  1 _eV_, and our universe is\n\ninhomogeneous We think that the cosmology principle needs to be reassessed (2) CMB cold spot and spherical universe The report about CMB cold spot have been around a long time [17] [,18] One of the\npossible explanations is that our universe is finite (spherical universe with\npresent _R_ _CMB_ ~ 10 28 _cm_ ) and the earth is not at the center, but near the center If that is\n\nthe case, we can deduce the CMB anisotropy spectrums of cold semi-sphere is\ndifferent to that of hot semi-sphere When we make observation face or away from\nthe CMB cold spot, the first peak of the CMB anisotropy spectrum will drop or rise\nwhile the sixth peak will rise or drop respectively The CMB anisotropy spectrum\nitself is “anisotropic” (3) The civilization layer (ball) We live in a spherical universe According to the size of the CMB cold spot, recently\nthe distance we deviate from the center of the sphere (using light year) is in numerical\nless than the H-decoupling time (using year) The center region of the spherical universe is the civilization layer (ball) According\nto astronomical scale, it is just nearby the Earth (4) It is possible that spherical universe itself does not have dark energy, which is the\n\nsuperstructure effect However, dark energy may associate with the background\nparticles/field of the big universe in which our spherical universe is located and\nsometimes immersed in “  ” background field or cloud (5) We may be able to obtain information from other spherical universe, especially its\n\ninformation in very early epoch\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\n(1) The speed of light _c_ is not a constant It has a mutation (phase transition) when\n\n_E_ = _E_ at the point _cr_ _n_  4 of mass tree At point _n_  8,7,6,5 of the mass tree, there\n\ncould be different phase transitions 18\n\n\n(2) The speed of light represents the limit of the speed of movement of elementary\n\nparticles The maximum speed of particles that belong to different category or\ndifferent cosmic level ( _n_  8,7,6,5,4 ) are different \n(3) As for  _c_  _const_ , there are two region for  : at the early universe, when _c_\nmonotonously decreases, the  monotonously increases After the universe became\ntransparent, the  monotonously decreases as _c_ decreases and finally tends to zero (4) The microwave background (CMB) is on an atomic level Correspondingly, the\n\ngravitational wave background (CGB) is on a nuclear level As the collisions of\nelectrons and positrons generate photons, the collisions of protons and anti-protons\n(or deuterons and anti-deuterons) create gravitons (5) The laws of nature can be expressed by mathematics under some simplifications In\n\nother words, any physics theory is just an approximation We discussed some\nphenomena related to super-high energy physics, which may determine the\napplicable region for modern physics including relativity #### **Reference (for summary section)**\n\n[1] Huang Wuliang, High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics (in Chinese), **20**\n(1996), 409;
