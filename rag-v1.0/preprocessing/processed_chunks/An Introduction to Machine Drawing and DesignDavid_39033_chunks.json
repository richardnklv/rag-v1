OF THE PEOPLE'S PALACE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS,\nLONDON\nAUTHOR OF 'A TEXT-BOOK ON PRACTICAL SOLID OR DESCRIPTIVE\nGEOMETRY'\n'AN ELEMENTARY TEXT-BOOK OF APPLIED MECHANICS' ETC FOURTH EDITION\n \nLONDON\nLONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO AND NEW YORK: 15 EAST 16th STREET\n1890\n\n\nPRINTED BY\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO , NEW-STREET SQUARE\nLONDON\n\n\nPREFACE It is now generally recognised that the old-fashioned method of\nteaching machine drawing is very unsatisfactory In teaching by this\nmethod an undimensioned scale drawing, often of a very elaborate\ndescription, is placed before the student, who is required to copy it Very often the student succeeds in making a good copy of the drawing\nplaced before him without learning very much about the object\nrepresented by it, and this state of matters is sometimes not much\nimproved by the presence of the teacher, who is often simply an art\nmaster, knowing nothing about machine design It is related of one\nschool that a pupil, after making a copy of a particular drawing, had a\ndiscussion with his teacher as to whether the object represented was a\nsewing machine or an electrical machine Evidently the publisher of\nthe drawing example in this case did not adopt the precaution which\na backward student used at an examination in machine design: he put\non a full title above his drawing, for the information of his examiner Now, if machine drawing is to be of practical use to any one, he\nmust be able to understand the form and arrangement of the parts of a\nmachine from an inspection of suitable drawings of them without\nseeing the parts themselves Also he ought to be able to make suitable\ndrawings of a machine or parts of a machine from the machine or the\nparts themselves In producing this work the author has aimed at placing before\nyoung engineers and others, who wish to acquire the skill and\nknowledge necessary for making the simpler working drawings such as\nare produced in engineers' drawing offices, a number of good\nexercises in drawing, sufficient for one session's work, and at the same\ntime a corresponding amount of information on the design of machine\ndetails generally The exercises set are of various kinds In the first and simplest\ncertain views of some machine detail are given, generally drawn to a\nsmall scale, which the student is asked to reproduce to dimensions\nmarked on these views, and he is expected to keep to these dimensions,\nand not to measure anything from the given illustrations In the\nsecond kind of exercise the student is asked to reproduce certain\n\n\nviews shown to dimensions given in words or in tabular form In the\nthird kind of exercise the student is required to make, in addition to\ncertain views shown to given dimensions, others which he can only\ndraw correctly if he thoroughly understands the design before him In\nthe fourth kind of exercise the student is asked to make the necessary\nworking drawings for some part of a machine which has been\npreviously described and illustrated, the dimensions to be calculated by\nrules given in the text The illustrations for this work are all new, and have been specially\nprepared by the author from working drawings, and he believes that\nthey will be found to represent the best modern practice As exercises in drawing, those given in this book are not numbered\nexactly in their order of difficulty, but unless on the recommendation\nof a teacher, the student should take them up in the order given,\nomitting the following:—26, 27, 28, 35, 40, 42, 43, 45, 49, 50, 54, 60,\n61, as he comes to them, until he has been right through the book;\nafterwards he should work out those which he omitted on first going\nover the book In addition to the exercises given in this work the student should\npractise making freehand sketches of machine details from actual\nmachines or good models of them Upon these sketches he should put\nthe proper dimensions, got by direct measurement from the machine\nor model by himself These sketches should be made in a note-book\nkept for the purpose, and no opportunity should be lost of inserting a\nsketch of any design which may be new to the student, always putting\non the dimensions if possible These sketches form excellent examples\nfrom which to make working drawings The student should also note\nany rules which he may meet with for proportioning machines, taking\ncare, however, in each case to state the source of such information for\nhis future guidance and reference As machine drawing is simply the application of the principles of\ndescriptive geometry to the representation of machines, the student of\nthe former subject, if he is not already acquainted with the latter,\nshould commence to study it at once D A L Glasgow: March 1887 PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION To this edition another chapter has been added, containing a\nnumber of miscellaneous exercises, which it is hoped will add to the\nusefulness of the work as a text-book in science classes The latest\nexamination paper in machine drawing by the Science and Art\nDepartment has also been added to the Appendix D A L London:

Instruments —For working the exercises in this book the\nstudent should be provided with the following:—A well-seasoned\nyellow pine drawing-board, 24 inches long, 17 inches wide, and 3⁄8\ninch or 1⁄2 inch thick, provided with cross-bars on the back to give it\nstrength and to prevent warping A T square, with a blade 24 inches\nlong attached permanently to the stock, but not sunk into it One 45°\nand one 60° set square The short edges of the former may be about 6\ninches and the short edge of the latter about 5 inches long A pair of\ncompasses with pen and pencil attachments, and having legs from 5\ninches to 6 inches long A pair of dividers, with screw adjustment if\npossible A pair of small steel spring pencil bows for drawing small\ncircles, and a pair of small steel spring pen bows for inking in the same A drawing pen for inking in straight lines All compasses should have\nround points, and if possible needle points A piece of india-rubber will\nalso be required, besides two pencils, one marked H or HH and one\nmarked HB or F; the latter to be used for lining in a drawing which is\nnot to be inked in, or for freehand work Pencils for mechanical drawing should be sharpened with a chisel\npoint, and those for freehand work with a round point Do not wet the\npencil, as the lines afterwards made with it are very difficult to rub\nout Drawing-paper for working drawings may be secured to the board\nby drawing-pins, but the paper for finished drawings or drawings upon\nwhich there is to be a large amount of colouring should be stretched\nupon the board The student should get the best instruments he can afford to buy,\nand he should rather have a few good instruments than a large box of\ninferior ones Drawing-paper —The names and sizes of the sheets of drawing\npaper are given in the following table:—\nInches\nDemy\n20 × 15\n\n\nMedium\n22 × 17\nRoyal\n24 × 19\nImperial\n30 × 22\nAtlas\n34 × 26\nDouble Elephant     40 × 27\nAntiquarian\n52 × 31\nThe above sizes must not be taken as exact In practice they will be\nfound to vary in some cases as much as an inch Cartridge-paper is made in sheets of various sizes, and also in rolls Hand-made paper is the best, but it is expensive Good cartridge-\npaper is quite suitable for ordinary drawings Centre Lines —Drawings of most parts of machines will be found to\nbe symmetrical about certain lines called centre lines These lines\nshould be drawn first with great care On a pencil drawing centre\nlines should be thin continuous lines; in this book they are shown thus\n— - — - — After drawing the centre line of any part the dimensions of that\npart must be marked off from the centre line, so as to insure that it\nreally is the centre line of that part: thus in making a drawing of a\nrivet, such as is shown at (a) fig 1, after drawing the centre line, half\nthe diameter of the rivet would be marked off on each side of that\nline, in order to determine the lines for the sides of the rivet Inking —For inking in drawings the best Indian ink should be used,\nand not common writing ink Common ink does not dry quick enough,\nand rapidly corrodes the drawing pens The pen should be filled by\nmeans of a brush or a narrow strip of paper, and not by dipping the\npen into the ink In cases where there are straight lines and arcs of circles touching\none another ink in the arcs first, then the straight lines; in this way it is\neasier to hide the joints Colouring —Camel's-hair or sable brushes should be used; the latter\nare the best, but are much more expensive than the former",
    "—Camel's-hair or sable brushes should be used; the latter\nare the best, but are much more expensive than the former The\ncolour should be rubbed down in a dish, and the tint should be light The mistake which a beginner invariably makes is in having the\ncolour of too dark a tint First go over the part to be coloured with the brush and clean\nwater for the purpose of damping it Next dry with clean blotting-\npaper to take off any superfluous water Then take another brush with\nthe colour, and beginning at the top, work from left to right and\ndownwards If it is necessary to recolour any part let the first coating\ndry before beginning Engineers have adopted certain colours to represent particular\nmaterials; these are given in the following table:—\nTable showing Colours used to represent Different Materials Material\nColour\nCast iron\nPayne's grey or neutral tint Wrought iron\nPrussian blue Steel\nPurple (mixture of Prussian blue and crimson lake) Brass\nGamboge with a little sienna or a very little red\nadded Copper\nA mixture of crimson lake and gamboge, the former\ncolour predominating Lead\nLight Indian ink with a very little indigo added Brickwork\nCrimson lake and burnt sienna Firebrick\nYellow and Vandyke brown Greystones\nLight sepia or pale Indian ink, with a little Prussian\nblue added Brown\nfreestone    \nMixture of pale Indian ink, burnt sienna, and\ncarmine Soft woods\nFor ground work, pale tint of sienna Hard woods\nFor ground work, pale tint of sienna with a little red\nadded For graining woods use darker tint with a greater\nproportion of red Printing —A good drawing should have its title printed, a plain\nstyle of letter being used for this purpose, such as the following:—\nThe following letters look well if they are well made, but they are\nmuch more difficult to draw For remarks on a drawing the following style is most suitable:—\nAll printing should be done by freehand Border lines are seldom put on engineering drawings Working Drawings —A good working drawing should be prepared\nin the following manner It must first be carefully outlined in pencil\nand then inked in After this all parts cut by planes of section should\nbe coloured, the colours used indicating the materials of which the\nparts are made Parts which are round may also be lightly shaded\nwith the brush and colours to suit the materials The centre lines are\nnow inked in with red or blue ink The red ink may be prepared by\nrubbing down the cake of crimson lake, and the blue ink in like\nmanner from the cake of Prussian blue Next come the distance or\ndimension lines, which should be put in with blue or red ink, depending\non which colour was used for the centre lines Dimension lines and\ncentre lines are best put in of different colour The arrow-heads at the\nends of the dimension lines are now put in with black ink, and so are\nthe figures for the dimensions The arrow-heads and the figures\nshould be made with a common writing pen The dimensions should\nbe put on neatly Many a good drawing has its appearance spoiled\nthrough being slovenly dimensioned We may here point out the importance of putting the dimensions\non a working drawing If the drawing is not dimensioned, the\n\n\nworkman must get his sizes from the drawing by applying his rule or\na suitable scale",
    "If the drawing is not dimensioned, the\n\n\nworkman must get his sizes from the drawing by applying his rule or\na suitable scale Now this operation takes time, and is very liable to\nresult in error Time is therefore saved, and the chance of error\nreduced, by marking the sizes in figures In practice it is not usual to send original drawings from the\ndrawing office to the workshop, but copies only The copies may be\nproduced by various 'processes,' or they may be tracings drawn by\nhand Many engineers do not ink in their original drawings, but leave\nthem in pencil; especially is this the case if the drawings are not likely\nto be much used Scales —The best scales are made of ivory, and are twelve inches\nlong Boxwood scales are much cheaper, although not so durable as\nthose made of ivory If the student does not care to go to the expense\nof ivory or boxwood scales, he can get paper ones very cheap, which\nwill be quite sufficient for his purpose The divisions of the scale\nshould be marked down to its edge, so that measurements may be\nmade by applying the scale directly to the drawing For working such\nexercises as are in this book the student should be provided with the\nfollowing scales:—\nA scale of 1, or 12 inches to a foot ”\n1⁄2 ”\n6\n”\n”\n1⁄3 ”\n4\n”\n”\n1⁄4 ”\n3\n”\n”\n1⁄6 ”\n2\n”\nA scale of 1 is spoken of as 'full size,' and a scale of 1⁄2 as 'half\nsize '\nEngineers in this country state dimensions of machines in feet,\ninches, and fractions of an inch, the latter being the 1⁄2, 1⁄4, 1⁄8,\n1⁄16, &c In making calculations it is generally more convenient to use\ndecimal fractions, and then substitute for the results the equivalent\nfractions in eighths, sixteenths, &c The following table will be found\nuseful for this purpose:—\n\n\nDecimal Equivalents of Fractions of an Inch Fraction Decimal Equivalent Fraction Decimal Equivalent\n1⁄32\n·03125\n17⁄32\n·53125\n1⁄16\n·0625\n9⁄16\n·5625\n3⁄32\n·09375\n19⁄32\n·59375\n1⁄8\n·125\n5⁄8\n·625\n5⁄32\n·15625\n21⁄32\n·65625\n3⁄16\n·1875\n11⁄16\n·6875\n7⁄32\n·21875\n23⁄32\n·71875\n1⁄4\n·25\n3⁄4\n·75\n9⁄32\n·28125\n25⁄32\n·78125\n5⁄16\n·3125\n13⁄16\n·8125\n11⁄32\n·34375\n27⁄32\n·84375\n3⁄8\n·375\n7⁄8\n·875\n13⁄32\n·40625\n29⁄32\n·90625\n7⁄16\n·4375\n15⁄16\n·9375\n15⁄32\n·46875\n31⁄32\n·96875\n1⁄2\n·5\n1\n1·0\nEngineers use a single accent (´) to denote feet, and a double\naccent (´´) to denote inches Thus 2´ 9´´ reads two feet nine inches II RIVETED JOINTS Two plates or pieces to be riveted together have holes punched or\ndrilled in them in such a manner that one may be made to overlap the\nother so that the holes in the one may be opposite the holes in the\nother The rivets, which are round bars of iron, or steel, or other\nmetal, are heated to redness and inserted in the holes; the head\nalready formed on the rivet, and called the tail, is then held up, and\nthe point is hammered or pressed so as to form another head This\nprocess of forming the second head on the rivet is known as riveting,\nand may be done by hand-hammering or by a machine Forms of Rivet Heads —In fig 1 are shown four different forms of\nrivet heads: (a) is a snap head, (b) a conical head (c) a pan head, and\n(d) a countersunk head Proportions of Rivet Heads —The diameter of the snap head is about\n1·7 times the diameter of the rivet, and its height about ·6 of the\ndiameter of the rivet The conical head has a diameter twice and a\nheight three quarters of the rivet diameter The greatest diameter of\nthe pan head is about 1·6, and its height ·7 of the rivet diameter The\ngreatest diameter of the countersunk head may be one and a half, and\nits depth a half of the diameter of the rivet In fig 1 at (a) and (b) are shown geometrical constructions devised\nby the author for drawing the snap and conical head for any size of\nrivet, the proportions being nearly the same as those given above Geometrical Construction for Proportioning Snap Heads —With centre\nA, and radius equal to half diameter of rivet, describe a circle cutting\nthe centre line of the rivet at B and C With centre B and radius BC\ndescribe the arc CD Make BE equal to AD With centre E and radius\nED describe the arc DFH Construction for Conical Head —With centre K, and radius equal to\ndiameter of rivet, describe the semicircle LMN, cutting the side of the\n\n\nrivet at M With centre M and radius MN describe the arc NP to cut\nthe centre line of rivet at P Join PL and PN When a number of rivets of the same diameter have to be shown\non the same drawing the above constructions need only be performed\non one rivet After the point E has been discovered the distance AE\nmay be measured off on all the other rivets, and the arcs\ncorresponding to DFH drawn with radii equal to ED In like manner\nthe height KP of the conical head may be marked off on all rivets of\nthe same diameter with conical heads Caulking —In order to make riveted joints steam- or water-tight the\nedges of the plates and the edges of the heads of the rivets are burred\ndown by a blunt chisel or caulking tool as shown at Q and R",

    "—The various forms of screw threads used in\nmachine construction are shown in fig 9 The Whitworth V thread is\nshown at (a) This is the standard form of triangular thread used in\nthis country The angle between the sides of the V is 55°, and one-\nsixth of the total depth is rounded off both at the top and bottom At\n(b) is shown the Sellers V thread, which is the standard triangular\nthread used by engineers in America In this form of thread the angle\nbetween the sides of the V is 60°, and one-eighth of the total depth is\ncut square off at the top and bottom The Square thread is shown at\n(c) This form is principally used for transmitting motion Comparing the triangular and square threads, the former is the\nstronger of the two; but owing to the normal pressure on the V thread\nbeing inclined to the axis of the screw, that pressure must be greater\nthan the pressure which is being transmitted by the screw; and\ntherefore, seeing that the normal pressure on the square thread is\nparallel, and therefore equal to the pressure transmitted in the\ndirection of the axis of the screw, the friction of the V thread must be\ngreater than the friction of the square thread In the case of the\ntriangular thread there is also a tendency of the pressure to burst the\nnut The Buttress thread shown at (e) is designed to combine the\nadvantages of the V and square threads, but it only has these\nadvantages when the pressure is transmitted in one direction; if the\ndirection of the pressure be reversed, the friction and bursting action\non the nut are even greater than with the V thread, because of the\ngreater inclination of the slant side of the buttress thread The angles\nof the square thread are frequently rounded to a greater or less extent\nto render them less easily damaged If this rounding is carried to\nexcess we get the Knuckle thread shown at (d) The rounding of the\nangles increases both the strength and the friction Exercise 11: Forms of Screw Threads —Draw to a scale of three times\nfull size the sections of screw threads as shown in fig 9 The pitch for the\nWhitworth, Sellers, and buttress threads to be 3⁄8 inch, and the pitch of\nthe square and knuckle threads to be 1⁄2 inch Dimensions of Whitworth Screws Diameter\nof screw\nNumber\nof\nthreads\nper\ninch\nDiameter\nat\nbottom\nof thread\nDiameter\nof screw\nNumber\nof\nthreads\nper\ninch\nDiameter\nat\nbottom\nof thread\nDiameter\nof screw\nNumber\nof\nthreads\nper\ninch\nDiam\nbot\nof th\n1⁄8\n40\n·093\n1¼\n7\n1·067\n3½\n3¼\n3·\n3⁄16\n24\n·134\n13⁄8\n6\n1·162\n3¾\n3\n3·3\n1⁄4\n20\n·186\n1½\n6\n1·286\n4\n3\n3·5\n5⁄16\n18\n·241\n15⁄8\n5\n1·369\n4¼\n27⁄8\n3·8\n3⁄8\n16\n·295\n1¾\n5\n1·494\n4½\n27⁄8\n4·0\n7⁄16\n14\n·346\n17⁄8\n4½\n1·590\n4¾\n2¾\n4·2\n1⁄2\n12\n·393\n2\n4½\n1·715\n5\n2¾\n4·5\n5⁄8\n11\n·508\n2¼\n4\n1·930\n5¼\n25⁄8\n4·7\n3⁄4\n10\n·622\n2½\n4\n2·180\n5½\n25⁄8\n5·0\n7⁄8\n9\n·733\n2¾\n3½\n2·384\n5¾\n2½\n5·2\n1\n8\n·840\n3\n3½\n2·634\n6\n2½\n5·4\n11⁄8\n7\n·942\n3¼\n3¼\n2·856\nGas Threads[1] (Whitworth Standard) Diameter of Screw\n1⁄8 1⁄4 3⁄8 1⁄2 5⁄8 3⁄4 1 1¼ 1½ 1¾ 2\nNumber of threads per\ninch\n28 19 19 14 14 14 11 11\n11\n11 11\n[1] Used for wrought-iron and brass tubes Representation of Screws —The correct method of representing\n\n\nscrew threads involves considerable trouble, and is seldom adopted by\nengineers for working drawings For an explanation of the method see\nthe author's Text-book on Practical Solid Geometry, Part II , problem\n134",
    ", problem\n134 A method very often adopted on working drawings is shown in\nfig 15; here the thin lines represent the points, and the thick lines the\nroots of the threads At fig 16 is shown a more complete method The\nsimplest method is illustrated by figs 10, 11, 13, and 14 Here dotted lines are drawn parallel to the axis of the screw as far\nas it extends, and at a distance from one another equal to the\ndiameter of the screw at the bottom of the thread F\nFig 10 Fig 11 Forms of Nuts —The most common form of nut is the hexagonal\nshown in figs 10, 13, 14, 15, and 16; next to this comes the square\nnut shown in fig 11 The method of drawing these nuts will be\nunderstood by reference to the figures; the small circles indicate the\ncentres, and the inclined lines passing through them the radii of the\ncurves which represent the chamfered or bevelled edge of the nut In\nall the figures but the first the chamfer is just sufficient to touch the\nmiddle points of the sides, and in these cases the drawing of the nut is\nsimpler Fig 12 Fig 12 F\nFig 13 Fig 14 Forms of Bolts —At (a), fig 12, is shown a bolt with a square head\nand a square neck If this form of bolt is passed through a square hole\nthe square neck prevents the bolt from turning when the nut is being\nscrewed up Instead of a square neck a snug may be used for the same\npurpose, as shown on the cup-headed bolt at (b) The snug fits into a\nshort groove cut in the side of the hole through which the bolt passes At (a) the diagonal lines are used to distinguish the flat side of the\n\n\nneck from the round part of the bolt above it At (c) is shown a tee-\nheaded bolt, and at (d) an eye-bolt Fig 13 represents a hook bolt A\nbolt with a countersunk head is shown in fig 11 If the countersunk\nhead be lengthened so as to take up the whole of the unscrewed part\nof the bolt, we get the taper bolt shown in fig 14, which is often used\nin the couplings of the screw shafts of steamships The taper bolt has\nthe advantage of having no projecting head, and it may also be made\na tight fit in the hole with less trouble than a parallel bolt Bolts may\nalso have hexagonal heads Fig 15 Fig 15 Fig 16 Fig 16 Studs, or stud bolts, are shown in figs 15 and 16; that in fig 15 is a\nplain stud, while that in fig 16 has an intermediate collar forged upon\nit, and is therefore called a collared stud Proportions of Nuts and Bolt-heads —In the hexagonal nut the\ndiameter D across the flats is 1½d + 1⁄8, where d is the diameter of\nthe bolt The same rule gives the width of a square nut across the\nflats A rule very commonly used in making drawings of hexagonal\nnuts is to make the diameter D, across the angles equal to 2d H, the\nheight of the nut, is equal to the diameter of the bolt In square and\nhexagonal headed bolts the height of the head varies from d to 2⁄3d;\nthe other dimensions are the same as for the corresponding nuts Washers are flat, circular, wrought-iron plates, having holes in\ntheir centres of the same diameter as the bolts on which they are\nused The object of the washer is to give a smooth bearing surface for\nthe nut to turn upon, and it is used when the surfaces of the pieces to\nbe connected are rough, or when the bolt passes through a hole larger\nthan itself, as shown in fig",

    "Draw full size the view shown Lock Nuts —In order that a nut may turn freely upon a bolt, there\nis always a very small clearance space between the threads of the nut\nand those of the bolt This clearance is shown exaggerated at (a), fig 17, where A is a portion of a bolt within a nut B Suppose that the bolt\nis stretched by a force W When the nut B is screwed up, the upper\nsurfaces of the projecting threads of the nut will press on the under\nsurfaces of the threads of the bolt with a force P equal and opposite to\nW, as shown at (b), fig When the nut B is screwed up, the upper\nsurfaces of the projecting threads of the nut will press on the under\nsurfaces of the threads of the bolt with a force P equal and opposite to\nW, as shown at (b), fig 17 17 When in this condition the nut has no\ntendency to slacken back, because of the friction due to the pressure\non the nut Now suppose that the tension W on the bolt is\nmomentarily diminished, then the friction which opposes the turning\nof the nut may be so much diminished that a vibration may cause it to\nslacken back through a small angle If this is repeated a great many\ntimes the nut may slacken back so far as to become useless F\nFig 17 Fig 18 Fig 19 Fig 19 19 A very common arrangement for locking a nut is shown at (a), fig 18 C is an ordinary nut, and B one having half the thickness of C B is\nfirst screwed up tight so as to act on the bolt, as shown at (b), fig 17",
    "17 C is then screwed on top of B When C is almost as tight as it can be\nmade, it is held by one spanner, while B is turned back through a\nsmall angle with another The action of the nuts upon the bolt and\nupon one another is now as shown at (b), fig 18 18 It will be seen that\nthe nuts are wedged tight on to the bolt, and that this action is\nindependent of the tension W in the bolt The nuts will, therefore,\nremain tight after the tension in the bolt is removed It is evident that if the nuts are screwed up in the manner\nexplained, the outer nut C will carry the whole load on the bolt; hence\nC should be the thicker of the two nuts In practice, the thin nut,\ncalled the lock nut, is often placed on the outside, for the reason that\nordinary spanners are too thick to act on the thin nut when placed\nunder the other Another very common arrangement for locking a nut is shown in\nfig Another very common arrangement for locking a nut is shown in\nfig 19 A is the bolt and B the nut, the lower part of which is turned\ncircular A groove C is also turned on the nut at this part The circular\npart of the nut fits into a circular recess in one of the parts connected\nby the bolt Through this part passes a set screw D, the point of which\ncan be made to press on the nut at the bottom of the groove C D is\nturned back when the nut B is being moved, and when B is tightened\nup, the set screw is screwed up so as to press hard on the bottom of\nthe groove C The nut B is thus prevented from slackening back The\nscrew thread is turned off the set screw at the point where it enters\nthe groove on the nut The use of the groove for receiving the point of the set screw is\nthis: The point of the set screw indents the nut and raises a bur which\nwould interfere with the free turning of the nut in the recess if the bur\nwas not at the bottom of a groove Additional security is obtained by\ndrilling a hole through the point of the bolt, and fitting it with a split\npin E Locking arrangements for nuts are exceedingly numerous, and\nmany of them are very ingenious, but want of space prevents us\ndescribing them We may point out, however, that many very good\n\n\nlocking arrangements have the defect of only locking the nut at\ncertain points of a revolution, say at every 30° It will be noticed that\nthe two arrangements which we have described are not open to this\nobjection Exercise 18 —Draw, full size, a plan, front elevation, and side\nelevation of the arrangement of nuts shown in fig 18, for a bolt 7⁄8 inch\ndiameter Exercise 19 —Draw the plan and elevation of the nut and locking\narrangement shown in fig 19",

    "The crank may also be shrunk on to the crank-\npin, the latter being then riveted over as shown in fig 37 37 F\nF\nA good plan to adopt in preference to the shrinking process is to\nforce the parts together by hydraulic pressure This method is adopted\nfor placing locomotive wheels on their axles, and for putting in crank-\npins As to the amount of pressure to be used, the practice is to allow\na force of 10 tons for every inch of diameter of the pin, axle, or shaft Instead of being riveted in, the crank pin may be prolonged and\nscrewed, and fitted with a nut Another plan is to put a cotter through\nthe crank and the crank-pin The distance from the centre of the crank-shaft to the centre of the\ncrank-pin is called the radius of the crank The throw of the crank is\n\n\ntwice the radius In a direct-acting engine the throw of the crank is\nequal to the stroke of the piston Exercise 36: Wrought-iron Overhung Crank —Draw the two elevations\nshown in fig 37, also a plan Scale 1½ inches to a foot Proportions of Overhung Cranks D = diameter of shaft d =         ”         crank-pin Length of large boss\n= ·9 D Diameter     ”\n= 1·8 D Length of small boss\n= 1·1 d Diameter     ”\n= 1·8 d Width of crank arm at centre of shaft\n= 1·3 D ”                 ”                   crank-pin = 1·5 d The thickness of the crank arm may be roughly taken as = ·7 D Exercise 37 —Design a wrought-iron crank for an engine having a\nstroke of 4 feet The crank-shaft is 9 inches in diameter, and the crank-pin\nis 4¾ inches in diameter and 6½ inches long Locomotive Cranked Axle —As an example of a cranked shaft we\ntake the cranked axle for a locomotive with inside cylinders shown in\nfig 38; here the crank and shaft or axle are forged in one piece A is\nthe wheel seat, B the journal, C the crank-pin, and D and E the crank\narms Only one half of the axle is shown in fig 38, but the other half\nis exactly the same The cranks on the two halves are, however, at\nright angles to one another The ends of the crank arms are turned in\nthe lathe, the crank-pin ends being turned at the same time as the\naxle, and the other ends at the same time as the crank-pin This\nconsideration determines the centres for the arcs shown in the end\nview Exercise 38 —Draw to a scale of 2 inches to a foot the side and end\nelevations of the locomotive cranked axle partly shown in fig 38 The\ndistance between the centre lines of the cylinders is 2 feet Built-up Cranks —The form of cranked shaft shown in fig 38 is\nlargely used for marine engines, but for the very powerful engines\nnow fitted in large ships this design of shaft is very unreliable, the\nbuilt-up crank shown in fig 39 being preferred, although it is much\nheavier than the other It will be seen from the figure that the shaft,\ncrank arms, and crank-pin are made separately The arms are shrunk\non to the pin and the shaft, and secured to the latter by sunk keys These heavy shafts and cranks are generally made of steel",

    "The draught or clearance is 7-16ths of an inch Fig 41 Fig 41 Box End —At (a), fig 42, is shown what is known as a box end for\na connecting rod The part which corresponds to the loose strap in the\nlast example is here forged in one piece with the connecting rod In\nthis form the brass bush is provided with a flange all round on one\nside, but on the opposite side the flange is omitted except at one end;\nthis is to allow of the bush being placed within the end of the rod The\nconstruction of the bush will be understood by reference to the sketch\nshown at (b) The bush is in two parts, which are pressed tightly\ntogether by means of a cotter This cotter is prevented from\nslackening back by two set screws Each set screw is cut off square at\nthe point, and presses on the flat bottom of a very shallow groove cut\non the side of the cotter The top, bottom, and ends of this box end are turned in the lathe\nat the same time as the rod itself; this accounts for the curved sections\nof these parts It is clear from the construction of a box end that it is only suitable\nfor an overhung crank Exercise 42: Locomotive Connecting Rod Exercise 42: Locomotive Connecting Rod —In fig 42 is shown a\nconnecting rod for an outside cylinder locomotive (a) is the crank-pin\nend, and (c) the cross-head end The end (a) has just been described\nunder the head 'box end ' We may just add that in this particular example\nthe brass bush is lined with white metal as shown, and that the\nconstruction of the oil-box is the same as that on the coupling rod end\nshown in fig 44 The end (c) is forked, and through the prongs of the fork\npasses the cross-head pin, of which a separate dimensioned drawing is\nshown at (d) Observe that the tapered parts A and B of this pin are parts\nof the same cone The rotation of the pin is prevented by a small key as\nshown The cross-head pin need not be drawn separately, and the\nisometric projection of the bush at (b) may be omitted, but all the other\nviews shown are to be drawn to a scale of 6 inches to a foot Marine Connecting Rod —The form of connecting rod shown in fig 43 is that used in marine engines, but it is also used extensively in\nland engines A B is the crank-pin end, and C the cross-head end The\nend A B is forged in one piece, and after it is turned, planed, and\nbored it is slotted across, so as to cut off the cap A The parts A and B\nare held together by two bolts as shown This end of the rod is fitted\nwith brass steps, which are lined with white metal The cross-head\nend is forked, and through the prongs of the fork passes a pin D,\nwhich also passes through the cross-head, which is forged on to the\npiston rod or attached to it in some other way Exercise 43: Marine Connecting Rod —Draw all the views shown in\nfig 43 of one form of marine connecting rod For detail drawings of the\nlocking arrangement for the nuts see fig 19, page 21 Scale 4 inches to a\nfoot Coupling Rods —A rod used to transmit the motion of one crank to\nanother is called a coupling rod A familiar example of the use of\ncoupling rods will be found in the locomotive Coupling rods are\nmade of wrought iron or steel, and are generally of rectangular\nsection The ends are now generally made solid and lined with solid\nbrass bushes, without any adjustment for wear This form of coupling\nrod end is found to answer very well in locomotive practice where the\nworkmanship and arrangements for lubrication are excellent When\nthe brass bush becomes worn it is replaced by a new one Fig",
    "Fig 44 shows an example of a locomotive coupling rod end for an\noutside cylinder engine In this case it is desirable to have the crank-\npin bearings for the coupling rods as short as possible, for a\nconnecting rod and coupling rod in this kind of engine work side by\nside on the same crank-pin, which, being overhung, should be as short\n\n\nas convenient for the sake of strength The requisite bearing surface is\nobtained by having a pin of large diameter The brass bush is\nprevented from rotating by means of the square key shown The oil-\nbox is cut out of the solid, and has a wrought-iron cover slightly\ndovetailed at the edges This cover fits into a check round the top\ninner edge of the box, which is originally parallel, but is made to close\non the dovetailed edges of the cover by riveting A hole in the centre\nof this cover, which gives access to the oil-box, is fitted with a\nscrewed brass plug The brass plug has a screwed hole in the centre,\nthrough which oil may be introduced to the box Dust is kept out of\nthe oil-box by screwing into the hole in the brass plug a common\ncork The oil is carried slowly but regularly from the oil-box over to\nthe bearing by a piece of cotton wick Fig 44 Fig 44 Exercise 44: Coupling Rod End —Draw first the side elevation and\nplan, each partly in section as shown in fig 44 Then instead of the view\nto the left, which is an end elevation partly in section, draw a complete\nend elevation looking to the right, and also a complete vertical cross\nsection through the centre of the bearing Scale 6 inches to a foot XIII CROSS-HEADS An example of a steam-engine cross-head is shown in fig 45 A is\nthe end of the piston rod which has forged upon it the cross-head B The cross-head pin shown at (d), fig 42, and to which the connecting\nrod is attached, works in the bearing C Projecting pieces D, forged on\nthe top and bottom of the cross-head, carry the slide blocks E which\nwork on the slide bars, and thus guide the motion of the piston rod Exercise 45: Locomotive Cross-head —In fig 45 are shown side and\nend elevations, partly in section, of the cross-head and slide blocks for an\noutside cylinder locomotive Draw these views half size, showing also on\nthe end elevation the cross-head pin and a vertical section of the\nconnecting rod end from fig 42",
    "42 The bush in the cross-head which forms\nthe bearing for the cross-head pin is of wrought iron, case-hardened, and\nis prevented from rotating by the key shown The cross-head is of\nwrought iron, and the slide blocks are of cast iron, and are fitted with\nwhite metal strips as shown A short brass tube leads oil from the upper\nslide block into a hole in the cross-head as shown, which carries it to a\nslot in the bush which distributes it over the cross-head pin XIV PISTONS A piston is generally a cylindrical piece which slides backwards\nand forwards inside a hollow cylinder The piston may be moved by\nthe action of fluid pressure upon it as in a steam-engine, or it may be\nused to give motion to a fluid as in a pump A piston is usually attached to a rod, called a piston rod, which\npasses through the end of the cylinder inside which the piston works,\nand which serves to transmit the motion of the piston to some piece\noutside the cylinder, or vice versâ A piston is usually attached to a rod, called a piston rod, which\npasses through the end of the cylinder inside which the piston works,\nand which serves to transmit the motion of the piston to some piece\noutside the cylinder, or vice versâ Fig 46 Fig 46 A plunger is a piston made in one piece with its piston rod, the\npiston and the rod being of the same diameter A piston which is provided with one or more valves which allow\nthe fluid to pass through it from one side to the other is called a\nbucket Simple Piston —The simplest form of piston is a plain cylinder\nfitting accurately another, inside which it moves Such a piston works\nwith very little friction, but as there is no adjustment for wear, such a\npiston is not suitable for a high fluid pressure if it has to work\nconstantly This simple form of piston is used in the steam-engine\nindicator, and also in pumps",
    "This simple form of piston is used in the steam-engine\nindicator, and also in pumps Fig 46 shows the piston of the circulation pump of a marine\nengine A is the cast-iron casing or barrel of the pump; B is a brass\nliner fitting tightly into the former at its ends, and secured by eight\nscrewed Muntz metal pins C, four at each end; D is the piston, which\nis made of brass, and is attached to a Muntz metal piston rod E The\nliner is bored out smooth and true from end to end, and the piston is\nturned so as to be a sliding fit to the liner The wear in this form of\npiston is diminished by making the rubbing surface large Exercise 46: Piston for Circulating Pump —Draw the vertical sectional\n\n\nelevation of the piston, &c , shown in fig 46, also a half plan and half\nhorizontal section through the centre Scale 4 inches to a foot Pump Bucket —The next form of piston which we illustrate is\nshown in fig 47 This represents the air-pump bucket of a marine\nengine The bucket is made of brass, and is provided with six india-\nrubber disc valves The rod is in this case made of Muntz metal Air-\npump rods for marine engines are very often made of wrought iron\ncased with brass It will be observed that there is a wide groove\naround the bucket, which is filled with hempen rope or gasket This\ngasket forms an elastic packing which prevents leakage This is an old-\nfashioned form of packing, and is now only used for pump buckets Exercise 47: Air-pump Bucket —Draw the sectional elevation of the\nair-pump bucket shown in fig 47 Also draw a half plan looking\ndownwards and a half plan looking upwards Scale 4 inches to a foot Fig 48 Fig 48 Ramsbottom's Packing —The form of packing used in the air-pump\nbucket, fig 47, is not suitable for steam pistons For the latter the\npacking is now always metallic The simplest form of metallic packing\nis that known as Ramsbottom's This form is very largely used for\nlocomotive pistons, and for small pistons in many kinds of engines\nbesides A locomotive piston for an 18-inch cylinder with\nRamsbottom's packing is shown in fig 48 The particular piston there\nillustrated is made of brass, and is secured to a wrought-iron piston\nrod by a brass nut Two circumferential grooves of rectangular section\nare turned out of the piston, and into these fit two corresponding\nrings, which may be of brass, cast iron, or steel In this example the\nrings are of cast iron These rings are first turned a little larger in\ndiameter than the bore of the cylinder (in this example 1⁄2 inch), and\n\n\nthen sprung over the piston into the groves prepared for them Their\nown elasticity causes the rings to press outwards on the cylinder At\nthe point where a ring is split a leakage of steam will take place, but\nwith quick-running pistons this leakage is unimportant The points\nwhere the rings are cut should be placed diametrically opposite, so as\nto diminish the leakage of steam Exercise 48: Locomotive Piston —A part elevation and part section of\na locomotive piston, for a cylinder having a bore 18 inches in diameter, is\nshown in fig 48 Draw this, and also a view looking on the nut in the\ndirection of the axis of the piston rod Scale 6 inches to a foot Note —The reason why the part of the piston rod within the piston has\nsuch a quick taper is that the piston has to be taken off the rod while it is\nin the cylinder The cross-head being forged on the end of the piston rod\nprevents the piston and piston rod being withdrawn together Large Pistons —Pistons of large diameter are generally provided\nwith two cast-iron packing rings placed within the same groove These\nrings are pressed outwards against the cylinder, and also against the\nsides of the groove by one or more springs One form of this packing\n(Lancaster's) is shown in fig 49",

    "All the\nparts are of brass except the valve proper, which is of phosphor bronze Scale 6 inches to a foot Conical Disc Valves —A very common form of valve is that shown\nin figs 56 and 57 56 and 57 This form of valve consists of a disc, the edge of\nwhich (called the face) is conical The conical edge of this disc fits\naccurately on a corresponding seat The angle which the valve face\nmakes with its axis is generally 45° If the disc is raised, either by the\naction of the fluid as in the india-rubber valve, or by other means, an\nopening is formed around the disc through which the fluid can pass The valve is guided in rising and falling either by three feathers\nunderneath it, as in fig 56, or by a central spindle which moves freely\nthrough a hole in the centre of a bridge which stretches across the\nseat, as in fig 57 57 The lift of the valve is limited by a stop above it,\nwhich forms part of the casing containing the valve The lift should in\nno case exceed one-fourth of the diameter of the valve, and it is\ngenerally much less than this The guiding feathers (fig 56) are\n\n\nnotched immediately under the disc for the purpose of making\navailable the full circumferential opening of the valve for the passage\nof the fluid These notches also prevent the feathers from interfering\nwith the turning or scraping of the valve face Conical disc valves and their seats are nearly always made of\nbrass Exercise 58: Conical Disc Valves —Draw, half size, the plans and\nelevations shown in figs 56 and 57 In fig 57 the valve is shown open in\nthe elevation, and in the plan it is removed altogether in order to show\nthe seat with its guide bridge",
    "57 the valve is shown open in\nthe elevation, and in the plan it is removed altogether in order to show\nthe seat with its guide bridge Fig 56 Fig 56 Fig 57 Fig 57 Simple Slide Valve —The form of valve shown in fig 58, often\ncalled the locomotive slide valve, is very largely used in all classes of\nsteam-engines for distributing the steam in the steam cylinders The\nvalve is shown separately at (d), (e), and (f), while at (a), (b), and (c)\nis shown its connection with the steam cylinder It will be observed that the valve itself is in the shape of a box\nwith one side open, the edges of the open side being flanged When\nthe valve is in its middle position, as shown at (a), two of these\nflanged edges completely cover two rectangular openings S1 and S2,\ncalled steam ports, while the hollow part of the valve is opposite to a\nthird port E, called the exhaust port As shown at (a) the piston P\nwould be moving upwards and the valve downwards By the time the\npiston has reached the top of its stroke the valve will have moved so\nfar down as to partly uncover the steam port S1, and admit steam\nfrom the valve casing C through S1 and the passage P1 to the top of\nthe piston The pressure of this steam on the top of the piston will\nforce the latter down While the above action has been going on, the\nport S2 will have become uncovered, and the hollow part of the valve\nwill be opposite both the steam port S2 and the exhaust port E, so that\nthe steam from the under side of the piston, and which forced the\n\n\npiston up, can now escape by the passage P2, the steam port S2, and\nthe exhaust port E to the exhaust outlet O, and thence into the\natmosphere, if it is a non-condensing engine, or into the condenser if\nit is a condensing engine, or into another cylinder if it is a compound\nengine After the piston has performed, a certain part of its downward\nstroke, the valve, which has been moving downwards, will commence\nto move upwards, and when it has reached a certain point it will\ncover the port S1, and shut off the supply of steam to the top of the\npiston It is generally arranged that the steam shall be cut off before\nthe piston reaches the end of the stroke When the piston reaches the\nbottom of its stroke the valve has moved far enough up to uncover the\nport S2 and admit steam to the bottom of the piston, and to uncover\nthe port S1 and allow the steam to escape from the top of the piston\nthrough the passage P1, the port S1, the port E, and outlet O In this\nway the piston is moved up and down in the cylinder The valve is attached to a valve spindle S by nuts as shown, the\nhole in the valve through which the spindle passes being oval-shaped\nto permit of the valve adjusting itself so as to always press on its seat When the valve is in its middle position it generally more than\ncovers the steam ports The amount which the valve projects over the\nsteam port on the outside, the valve being in its middle position, is\ncalled the outside lap of the valve, and the amount which it projects on\nthe inside is called the inside lap When the term lap is used without\nany qualification, outside lap is to be understood In fig",
    "In fig 58 it will be\nseen that the valve has no inside lap, and that the outside lap is three-\neighths of an inch The inside lap is generally small compared with\nthe outside lap The inside lap is generally small compared with\nthe outside lap Fig 58 Fig 58 When the piston is at the beginning of its stroke the steam port is\ngenerally open by a small amount called the lead of the valve The reciprocating motion of the slide valve is nearly always\nderived from an eccentric fixed on the crank-shaft of the engine Slide\nvalves are generally made of brass, bronze, or cast iron Exercise 59: Simple Slide Valve —At (d), fig 58, is shown a sectional\nelevation of a simple slide valve for a steam-engine, the section being\ntaken through the centre line of the valve spindle, while at (e) is shown a\ncross section and elevation, and at (f) a plan of the same Draw all these\nviews full size, and also a sectional elevation at A B Draw all these\nviews full size, and also a sectional elevation at A B The valve is made of\nbrass, and the valve spindle and nuts of wrought iron Exercise 60: Slide Valve Casing, &c , for Steam-engine —Draw, half\nsize, the views shown at (a), (b), and (c), fig 58; also a sectional plan at L\nM (b) is an elevation of the valve casing with the cover and the valve\nremoved (a) is a sectional elevation, the section being taken through the\naxes of the steam cylinder and valve spindle (c) is a sectional plan, the\nsection being a horizontal one through the centre of the exhaust port The\ninlet and outlet for the steam are clearly shown in the sectional plan: in\nthe sectional elevation their positions are shown by dotted circles The stroke of the piston is in this case 12 inches, so that from the\ndimensions given at (a) it must come within a quarter of an inch of each\nend of the cylinder; this is called the cylinder clearance The piston has three Ramsbottom rings, a quarter of an inch wide and\na quarter of an inch apart The steam cylinder and valve casing are made of cast iron Cocks —A cock consists of a slightly conical plug which fits into a\ncorresponding casing cast on a pipe Through the plug is a hole which\nmay be made by turning the plug to form a continuation of the hole in\nthe pipe, and thus allow the fluid to pass, or it may be turned round\nso that the solid part of the plug lies across the hole in the pipe, and\nthus prevent the fluid from passing As the student will be quite\nfamiliar with the common water cock or tap such as is used in\ndwelling-houses we need not illustrate it here Fig 59 Fig 59 Fig 59 shows a cock of considerable size, which may be used for\nwater or steam under high pressure The plug in this example is\nhollow, and is prevented from coming out by a cover which is secured\n\n\nto the casing by four stud bolts An annular ridge of rectangular\nsection projecting from the under side of the cover, and fitting into a\ncorresponding recess on the top of the casing, serves to ensure that\nthe cover and plug are concentric, and prevents leakage Leakage at\nthe neck of the plug is prevented by a gland and stuffing-box The top\nend of the plug is made square to receive a handle for turning it The\nsize of a cock is taken from the bore of the pipe in which it is placed;\nthus fig 59 shows a 2¼-inch cock Exercise 61: 2¼-inch Steam or Water Cock —First draw the views of\nthis cock shown in fig 59, then draw a half end elevation and half cross\nsection through the centre of the plug Scale 6 inches to a foot Instead of drawing the parts of the pipe on the two sides of the plug in\nthe same straight line as in fig 59, one may be shown proceeding from\nthe bottom of the casing, so that the fluid will have to pass through the\nbottom of the plug and through one side This is a common arrangement All the parts of the valve and casing in this example are made of brass",
    "All the parts of the valve and casing in this example are made of brass XVII XVII MATERIALS USED IN MACHINE\nCONSTRUCTION Cast Iron —The essential constituents of cast iron are iron and\ncarbon, the latter forming from 2 to 5 per cent of the total weight Cast iron, however, usually contains varying small amounts of silicon,\nsulphur, phosphorus, and manganese In cast iron the carbon may exist partly in the free state and partly\nin chemical combination with the iron In white cast iron the whole of the carbon is in chemical\ncombination with the iron, while in grey cast iron the carbon is\nprincipally in the free state, that is, simply mixed mechanically with\nthe iron It is the free carbon which gives the grey iron its dark\nappearance A mixture of the white and grey varieties of cast iron\nwhen melted produces mottled cast iron The greater the amount of\ncarbon chemically combined with the iron, the whiter, harder, and\nmore brittle does it become The white cast iron is stronger than the grey, but being more\nbrittle it is not so suitable for resisting suddenly applied loads White\niron melts at a lower temperature than grey iron, but after melting it\ndoes not flow so well, or is not so liquid as the grey iron White iron\ncontracts while grey iron expands on solidifying The grey iron,\ntherefore, makes finer castings than the white Castings after\nsolidifying contract in cooling about 1⁄8 of an inch per foot Castings\npossessing various degrees of strength and hardness are produced by\nmelting mixtures of various proportions of white and grey cast irons White cast iron has a higher specific gravity than grey cast iron Cast iron gives little or no warning before breaking The thickness\nof the metal throughout a casting in cast iron should be as uniform as\npossible, so that it may cool and therefore contract uniformly\nthroughout; otherwise some parts may be in a state of initial strain\nafter the casting has cooled, and will therefore be easier to fracture Re-entrant angles should be avoided; such should be rounded out with\nfillets The presence of phosphorus in cast iron makes it more fusible, and\n\n\nalso more brittle The presence of sulphur diminishes the strength\nconsiderably The grey varieties of cast iron are called foundry irons or foundry\npigs, while the white varieties are called forge irons or forge pigs, from\nthe fact that they are used for conversion into wrought iron Amongst iron manufacturers the different varieties of cast iron are\ndesignated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, &c , the lowest number being\napplied to the greyest variety Chilled Castings —When grey cast iron is melted a portion of the\nfree carbon combines chemically with the iron; this, however,\nseparates out again if the iron is allowed to cool slowly; but if it is\nsuddenly cooled a greater amount of the carbon remains in chemical\ncombination, and a whiter and harder iron is produced Advantage is\ntaken of this in making chilled castings In this process the whole or a\npart of the mould is lined with cast iron, which, being a\ncomparatively good conductor of heat, chills a portion of the melted\nmetal next to it, changing it into a hard white iron to a depth varying\nfrom 1⁄8 to 1⁄2 an inch To protect the cast-iron lining of the mould\nfrom the molten metal it is painted with loam Malleable Cast Iron —This is prepared by imbedding a casting in\npowdered red hematite (an oxide of iron), and keeping it at a bright\nred heat for a length of time varying from several hours to several\ndays according to the size of the casting By this process a portion of\nthe carbon in the casting is removed, and the strength and toughness\nof the latter become more like the strength and toughness of wrought\nor malleable iron Wrought or Malleable Iron —This is nearly pure iron, and is made\nfrom cast iron by the puddling process, which consists chiefly of\nraising the cast iron to a high temperature in a reverberatory furnace\nin the presence of air, which unites with the carbon and passes off as\ngas In other words the carbon is burned out The iron is removed\nfrom the puddling furnace in soft spongy masses called blooms, which\nare subjected to a process of squeezing or hammering called shingling These shingled blooms still contain enough heat to enable them to be\nrolled into rough puddled bars These puddled bars are of very inferior\nquality, having less than half the strength of good wrought iron The\npuddled bars are cut into pieces which are piled together, reheated,\n\n\nand again rolled into bars, which are called merchant bars This\nprocess of piling, reheating, and re-rolling may be repeated several\ntimes, depending on the quality of iron required Up to a certain point\nthe quality of the iron is improved by reheating and rolling or\nhammering, but beyond that a repetition of the process diminishes the\nstrength of the iron The process of piling and rolling gives wrought iron a fibrous\nstructure When subjected to vibrations for a long time, the structure\nbecomes crystalline and the iron brittle The crystalline structure\ninduced in this way may be removed by the process of annealing,\nwhich consists in heating the iron in a furnace, and then allowing it to\ncool slowly Forging and Welding —The process of pressing or hammering\nwrought iron when at a red or white heat into any desired shape is\ncalled forging If at a white heat two pieces of wrought iron be brought\ntogether, their surfaces being clean, they may be pressed or\nhammered together, so as to form one piece This is called welding,\nand is a very valuable property of wrought iron Steel —This is a compound of iron with a small per-centage of\ncarbon, and is made either by adding carbon to wrought iron, or by\nremoving some of the carbon from cast iron In the cementation process, bars of wrought iron are imbedded in\npowdered charcoal in a fireclay trough, and kept at a high\ntemperature in a furnace for several days The iron combines with a\nportion of the carbon to form blister steel, so named because of the\nblisters which are found on the surface of the bars when they are\nremoved from the furnace The bars of blister steel are broken into pieces about 18 inches\nlong, and tied together in bundles by strong steel wire These bundles\nare raised to a welding heat in a furnace, and then hammered or\nrolled into bars of shear steel To form cast steel the bars of blister steel are broken into pieces\nand melted into crucibles In the Siemens-Martin process for making steel, cast and wrought\niron are melted together on the hearth of a regenerative gas-furnace Bessemer steel is made by pouring melted cast iron into a vessel\ncalled a converter, through which a blast of air is then urged By this\nmeans the carbon is burned out, and comparatively pure iron remains To this is added a certain quantity of 'spiegeleisen,' which is a\ncompound of iron, carbon, and manganese Hardening and Tempering of Steel —Steel, if heated to redness and\ncooled suddenly, as by immersion in water, is hardened The degree of\nhardness produced varies with the rate of cooling; the more rapidly\nthe heated steel is cooled, the harder does it become Hardened steel\nis softened by the process of annealing, which consists in heating the\nhardened steel to redness, and then allowing it to cool slowly Hardened steel is tempered, or has its degree of hardness lowered, by\nbeing heated to a temperature considerably below that of a red heat,\nand then cooling suddenly The higher the temperature the hardened\nsteel is raised to, the lower does its 'temper' become Case-hardening —This is the name given to the process by which\nthe surfaces of articles made of wrought iron are converted into steel,\nand consists in heating the articles in contact with substances rich in\ncarbon, such as bone-dust, horn shavings, or yellow prussiate of\npotash This process is generally applied to the articles after they are\ncompletely finished by the machine tools or by hand The coating of\nsteel produced on the article by this process is hardened by cooling\nthe article suddenly in water Copper —This metal has a reddish brown colour, and when pure is\nvery malleable and ductile, either when cold or hot, so that it may be\nrolled or hammered into thin plates, or drawn into wire Slight traces\nof impurities cause brittleness, although from 2 to 4 per cent of\nphosphorus increases its tenacity and fluidity Copper is a good\nconductor of heat and of electricity Copper is largely used for making\nalloys Alloys —Brass contains two parts by weight of copper to one of\nzinc Muntz metal consists of three parts of copper to two of zinc Alloys consisting of copper and tin are called bronze or gun-metal Bronze is harder the greater the proportion of tin which it contains;\nfive parts of copper to one of tin produce a very hard bronze, and ten\nof copper to one of tin is the composition of a soft bronze Phosphor\nbronze contains copper and tin with a little phosphorus; it has this\n\n\nadvantage over ordinary bronze, that it may be remelted without\ndeteriorating in quality This alloy also has the advantage that it may\nbe made to possess great strength accompanied with hardness, or less\nstrength with a high degree of toughness Wood —In the early days of machines wood was largely used in\ntheir construction, but it is now used to a very limited extent in that\ndirection Beech and hornbeam are used for the cogs of mortise wheels Yellow pine is much used by pattern-makers Box, a heavy, hard,\nyellow-coloured wood, is used for the sheaves of pulley blocks, and\nsometimes for bearings in machines Lignum-vitæ is a very hard dark-\ncoloured wood, and remarkable for its high specific gravity, being 11⁄3\ntimes the weight of the same volume of water This wood is much\nused for bearings of machines which are under water",
