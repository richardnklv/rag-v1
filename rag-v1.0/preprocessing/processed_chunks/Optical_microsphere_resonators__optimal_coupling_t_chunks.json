    "Theoretical consideration is complemented by experimental tests of variable loading regimes\nand demonstration of improved coupling efficiency with prism coupler II II GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\nLet us examine excitation of a single high-Q whispering gallery mode with high quality-factor by (N ) travelling\nmodes in an evanescent wave coupler This coupler can either have infinite number of spatial modes (N = ∞, as in\nprism coupler [9,10] and slab) or only one mode (N = 1, as in tapered fiber [13] and integrated channel waveguide) We shall start with simple description of the system using lumped parameters and quasigeometrical approximation Let A 0 (t) be the amplitude of a circulating mode of total internal reflection in the resonator (see Fig 1) to model\nthe whispering-gallery mode Let the pump power be distributed in the coupler between its modes so that B k (t) is\nthe amplitude of mode k (1 ≤ k ≤ N ) and B [in] (t) is the slow varying amplitude with [�] |B k [in] [(][t][)][|] [2] [ =][ |][B] [in] [(][t][)][|] [2] [ equal to]\ntotal pump power Let us assume for simplicity that coupling between different modes is absent without the resonator 1\n\n\nAssuming that the coupling zone is much smaller than the diameter D of the resonator, we can introduce local\nreal amplitude coefficients of transmittance T k to describe the coupling of the resonator with all modes of the coupler\n(either guided or leakage ones) and the internal reflectivity coefficient R We shall denote arrays of transmittance\ncoefficients and amplitudes as vectors T and B respectively If the quality-factor of the resonator mode is high enough,\nthen a single circle gives only small contribution to the mode buildup and therefore 1 − R ≪ 1 In this case (neglecting\nfor simplicity absorption and scattering losses in the coupler R k [2] [= 1][ −] [T] [ 2] k [) we obtain]\n\n\nR = � R k = 1 − � T k [2] [/][2 = 1][ −] [T] [ 2] [/][2] (1)\n\n\nThe equation for the mode of the resonator will be the following:\n\n\nA 0 (t) = i � T k B k [in] [(][t][) +][ RA] [0] [(][t][ −] [τ] [0] [) exp [][i][2][πn] [s] [L/λ][ −] [αL/][2]]\n\nB k [out] (t) = R k B k [in] [(][t][) +][ iT] [k] [A] [0] [(][t][)][ ] (2)\n\n\nwhere τ 0 = n s L/c is the circulation time for the mode travelling inside the sphere, L ≃ 2πa is approximately equal\nto the circumference of the sphere, λ is the wavelength, n s is the refraction index, c is the speed of light and α is the\nlinear attenuation in the resonator caused by scattering, absorption and radiation In the above representation the microsphere is equivalent to a ring resonator formed by mirrors with transmittances\nT k and filled with lossy medium, or, in case of single-mode coupling, as pointed in [11], to a Fabry-Perot resonator of\nthe length L/2 with totally reflecting rear mirror If propagation losses are small, then near the resonance frequency ω 0 = 2πc/λ 0, n s L = mλ 0, where m is integer,\nby expanding A 0 (t − τ 0 ) = A 0 (t) − τ 0 dA 0 /dt from (2) we obtain:\n\ndAdt 0 [+ (][δ] [c] [ +][ δ] [0] [ +][ i][∆][ω][)][A] [0] [ =][ iCB] [in] [,] (3)\n\n\nwhere (4)\nτ 0\n\n\n\n\n[αc] ; δ c = [1][ −] [R]\n\n2n s Rτ 0\n\n\n\n\n[T] [ 2] ; C = [T][ Γ]\n\n2τ 0 τ 0\n\n\n\nδ 0 = [αc]\n\n\n\n\n[ −] [R]\n\n= [T] [ 2]\nRτ 0 2τ\n\n\n\nWe introduce here another important coefficient:\n\n\nΓ = [TB] [in] (5)\n\nT B [in] [ ]\n\n\nThis coefficient Γ ≤ 1 describes mode matching and shows how close the field in the couplers matches the near field\nof resonator mode The term δ 0 originates from intrinsic quality factor Q 0 = 2πn s /αλ while δ c describes loading i e mode energy\nescape to all modes of the coupler Hereafter we shall mark all values associated with coupler by index ‘c’ and values\nassociated with microsphere by index ‘s’ Equation (3) is a classical equation for the amplitude of the resonator pumped by harmonical field As will be shown below, coefficients T k can be calculated as normalized overlap integrals of the fields of the\nmicrosphere mode and modes of the coupler The difference from Fabry-Perot resonator is that for the microsphere,\ncoefficients T k are not fixed parameters but instead, strongly depend on geometry of coupling (e",
    "The difference from Fabry-Perot resonator is that for the microsphere,\ncoefficients T k are not fixed parameters but instead, strongly depend on geometry of coupling (e g exponentially\non the value of the gap between microsphere and coupler) and are therefore in hands of experimentalist As we\nalready emphasized in [9], it is the controllable relation between δ 0 and δ c that defines coupling efficiency upon given\nconfiguration (accounting both for mode overlap and synchronism and optimized loading to provide energy exchange\nbetween resonator and coupler) Stationary solution for (3) has the typical form:\n\n\n\n2δ c (6)\n\nτ 0\n\n\n\nA 0 = i2δ c B [in]\n\n\n\nδ 0 + δ c + i∆ω\n\n\n\ni2δ c B [in] Γ iΓ B [in]\n\nδ 0 + δ c + i∆ω T [=] δ 0 + δ c +\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\nField amplitude in the resonator will be maximal at δ c = δ 0 (intrinsic quality-factor equals the loaded Q) The output\nstationary amplitudes are\n\n\nB [out] = B [in] − B [in] 2δ c Γ T (7)\nδ 0 + δ c + i∆ω T\n\n\nand total output intensity in this case has lorentzian shape:\n\n\n2\n\n\n4δ c δ 0 Γ [2]\n(B [out] ) [2] = (B [in] ) [2] 1 −\n� (δ 0 + δ c ) [2] + (∆ω) [2]\n\n\n\n(8)\n�\n\n\n\nIt can be easily seen from this equation that the output signal can be considered as the result of interference of the\ninput and the ”re-emission” from the resonator Note that mode distribution of the second term in (7) (resonator\nmode emission pattern) does not depend on the input distribution The most important case of (7) is the regime of ideal matching (Γ = 1), obtained with B [in] /B [in] = T/T when the\nfraction of the input power fed into the resonator mode is maximal (Single-mode coupler is always ”mode-matched” )\nIn this case, provided δ c = δ 0, output intensity turns to zero i e the entire input power is lost inside the resonator This regime is usually called critical coupling Sometimes coupling is characterized by the fractional depth K of the\nresonance dip in intensity transmittance observed upon varying the frequency of exciting wave in the coupler; from\n(8) K can be expressed as follows\n\n\n\n\n[4][Q] [0] [Q] [c] [Γ] [ 2] 4QΓ [2]\n\n(Q 0 + Q c ) [2] [ =] Q 0 + Q\n\n\n\nK = [4][Q] [0] [Q] [c] [Γ] [ 2]\n\n\n\n(Q 0 + Q c ) [2] Q 0 + Q c\n\n\n1\nQ [= 2] ω [δ] [0] [+ 2] ω [δ] [c] [= 1] Q 0 + Q [1] c\n\n\n\n\n[δ] [0]\n\nω [+ 2] ω [δ] [c]\n\n\n\n+ [1]\nQ 0 Q\n\n\n\n\n[δ] [c]\n\nω [= 1]\n\n\n\n(9)\nQ c\n\n\n\nIn case of critical coupling K = 1 (100%) In case of nonideal matching, critical coupling may be observed until\n2Γ [2] - 1 (partial matching) if the output is mode-filtered to pick up only part of the coupler modes In this case\nleakage into other modes may be considered as additional internal losses, and critical coupling is obtained with lower\nloaded quality factor when δ c = δ 0 /(2Γ [2] − 1) If δ c ≫ δ 0 (overcoupling) then for matched coupling the output wave in\nresonance has the sign opposite to that out of resonance i e the resonator shifts phase by π It is appropriate to note\nhere that in traditional high-Q optical resonators comprised of mirrors, the quality-factor is limited by the mirrors’\nfinesse i",

microspheres, the situation is opposite, and the primary role belongs to the intrinsic\nquality-factor III III DIRECTIONAL COUPLER APPROACH\n\n\nThe goal of this section is to determine parameters of the coupler-resonator system from the electrodynamical point\nof view In the recent paper [15] by D R Rowland and J D D Love, famous for their popular book on the theory of\noptical waveguides [16], the problem of coupling with whispering-gallery modes is addressed on the basis of the model\nof distributed coupling between a travelling surface mode in cylindrical resonator and a given mode in a planar (slab)\nwaveguide In this approach, the coupling problem leads to the necessity to solve a system of differential equations,\nwhich in our designations looks as follows:\n\n\ndA 0\n\n= i∆β 0 (z)A 0 + iC k (z) exp [i(β k − β 0 )z]B k\ndz\n\ndB k = i∆β k (z)B k + iC k (z) exp [−i(β k − β 0 )z]A 0, (10)\n\ndz\n\n\nCoefficients ∆β 0 (z) and ∆β k (z) (describing perturbation of wave numbers β 0 and β k of modes of the resonator and\nthe coupler) and distributed coupling coefficients c k can be calculated explicitly as field cross-section integrals (see\n\n[15] and references therein) ∆β 0

normalized vs power;\nthe integration is done over cross-sections Indexes S and C denote that the integration is done inside the microsphere\nand coupler respectively In principle, conservation of energy requires that the two integrals in expression for C k [2] [be]\nequal and this is frequently postulated However, in common approximation that we also use here the above equality is\nsecured only for phase-matched or identical waveguides, while in the opposite case the dependence of the two integrals\non the gap is different Nevertheless, to provide efficient coupling, this equality must be satisfied 3\n\n\nParameters (11) are nonzero only in the coupling zone It may seem that the coupler transmission matrix (CTM)\nand, subsequently, the above introduced lumped T k coefficients can be found from equations (10) However, analytical\nderivation of the output field amplitudes cannot be found from (10) with exception of few simple cases It was perhaps\ndue to this fact that the authors of [15] presented only numerical solution for their particular case Moreover, in general\ncase CTM is a complex 2x2 matrix and cannot be characterized by one real parameter Fortunately, the situation is more favorable for optical microsphere resonators with high loaded quality-factor\nQ c = ω/2δ c, when T k ≪ 1 Indeed, from (4) it follows that T [2] = m/Q In a fused silica resonator with the diameter\n140µm (m ≃ 1000) and heavily loaded Q ≃ 10 [7] (intrinsic Q - factor can be of the order of 10 [10] in this case) T ≃ 1% In practice T is usually of the order of 10 [−][3] It means that the field amplitude A 0 changes insignificantly over the\ncoupling zone and can therefore be assumed constant in the second equation of (10), and the stationary amplitude\nA 0 ≫ B k Therefore an approximate solution can be obtained:\n\n\nA [out] 0 = RA [in] 0 [exp [][i][Φ][] +][ iT] [k] [B] k [in]\nB k [out] = B k [in] [+][ iT] [k] [A] [0] [,] (12)\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n∞\n\n\n∆β 0 dz

can be easily generalized for multimode coupler However expressions for the coupling\nparameters better suited for couplers with dense mode spectrum can be found in a more rigorous way directly

however, we can avoid them by assuming\neigenfrequences of interest ω j to be purely real For this we neglect the imaginary part that describes radiation losses\nand choose as the integration volume

COUPLERS\n\n\nLet us now use the developed approach for the analysis of coupling of whispering-gallery modes with optical fiber As soon as according to (refkcoupl), possibility of efficient coupling critically depends on the value of the loading\nquality-factor Q c and its relation with the intrinsic Q, in this section we shall focus on calculation of Q c and discuss\nbriefly methods to achieve phase synchronism and mode matching with different couplers To date, two types of optical fiber coupler to WG modes in microsphere were demonstrated The first one is the\neroded fiber coupler [5,11,12], where evanescent field of a propagating waveguide mode becomes accessible due to\npartial removal of the cladding in a bent section of the fiber The recently demonstrated second type of the

    "VI PRISM COUPLER: EXPERIMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND VARIABLE LOADING REGIMES\n\n\nIn order to illustrate the results of our analysis, we performed measurements to characterize coupling efficiency\nof the prism coupler with high-Q fused silica microspheres As in our previous experiments, we used microspheres\nfabricated of high-purity silica preforms by fusion in a hydrogen-oxygen microburner (see description of the technique\nin [20]) As in our previous experiments, we used microspheres\nfabricated of high-purity silica preforms by fusion in a hydrogen-oxygen microburner (see description of the technique\nin [20]) The focus of present experiment was to obtain enhanced coupling by maximizing the mode matching\n\n\nΓ = [TB] [in] (39)\n\nT B [in] [ ]\n\n\nalong with the lines briefly described in Sec 2 In our experiment, to diminish astigmatic distortions of the input\ngaussian beam at the entrance face of the coupler prism, we used equilateral prism of flint glass (SF-18, refraction\nindex n= 1 72) 72) As usual, the input beam (a symmetrical gaussian beam from a single-mode piezo-tunable He-Ne\nlaser) was focused onto the inner surface of the prism, at the proximity point with the microsphere The angle of\nincidence and the cross-section of the input beam were then optimized to obtain maximum response of a chosen WG\nmode Initial alignment was done on the basis of direct observation of resonance interference in the far field, with\nthe frequency of the laser slowly swept across the resonance frequency of the mode With the given choice of prism\nmaterial, optimal angle of incidence for excitation of whispering-gallery modes q ≃ 1 (close to critical angle of total\ninternal refraction at the silica-glass interface) was approximately equal to 60 degrees so that astigmatic distortions\nof the input beam at the entrance face of the prism were minimized After preliminary alignment, the coupling efficiency was further maximized on the basis of direct observation of the\nresonance absorption dip: full intensity of the beam after the coupler prism was registered by linear photodetector and\nmonitored on digital oscilloscope Results obtained with a T M ℓℓq mode (possessing strongest confinement of the field\nin meridional direction) are presented in Fig 3 in form of the resonance curves observed upon successively decreasing\ncoupling (stepwise increasing gap)",
    "3 in form of the resonance curves observed upon successively decreasing\ncoupling (stepwise increasing gap) Fig Fig 3 illustrates good agreement of theory with experiment: indeed, resonance\ntransmission decreases with loading until the quality-factor becomes twice smaller than the intrinsic Q 0 ; after that,\nintensity contrast of the resonance decreases 3 illustrates good agreement of theory with experiment: indeed, resonance\ntransmission decreases with loading until the quality-factor becomes twice smaller than the intrinsic Q 0 ; after that,\nintensity contrast of the resonance decreases Fig 4 presents explicitly the plot of the fitted experimental intensity dip\nversus the loaded quality-factor Q = Q c Q 0 /(Q c + Q 0 ), which yields satisfactory agreement with parabolic prediction\nfrom the generalized expression (9) Maximal contrast of the resonance obtained in our experiment was K [2] ≃ 0 79\n(the ”deepest” curve in Fig 3) VII VII CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe have presented a general approach to describe the near-field coupling of high-Q whispering-gallery modes in\noptical microsphere resonators to guided or free-space travelling waves in coupler devices with continuous and discrete\nspectrum of propagating modes A convenient formalism of the loaded quality-factor to describe the energy exchange between coupler modes and\nthe resonator provides a quick algorithm to determine the efficiency of the given type of the coupler, under given\nvalue of the intrinsic quality-factor of WG modes Variable relation between the intrinsic Q-factor and loading losses (described by Q c ) through energy escape to\ncoupler modes is a distinctive new property of whispering-gallery resonators compared to conventional Fabry-Perot\n\n\n8\n\n\ncavities: the latter are characterized by fixed coupling through the reflectivities of comprising low-loss mirrors This\nunique ability to control the Q and coupling via WG mode evanescent field allows to obtain new regimes in the\ndevices, analogous to those available in lumped-element RF and microwave engineering Theoretical estimates on the basis of the suggested theory are in good agreement with the reported data on the\nefficiency of different coupler devices including tapered, sidepolished fiber and slab waveguide Original experimental results include direct demonstration of variable loading and enhanced efficiency (up to about\n80% ) in prism coupler Ease of control of phase synchronism and mode overlap between coupler and microsphere\nmode by adjusting the input beam parameters make the prism coupler versatile and efficient for various applications\nof high-Q microsphere resonators In conclusion, let us note that the near-field coupling may be not a unique method to efficiently excite highly confined\nwhispering-gallery modes in microspheres Simple estimates show that for example, recent advances in optical fiber\ngrating fabrication methods [21] may allow to ”imprint” a Bragg-type critical coupler for high-Q WG modes directly\non a sphere made of low-loss germanosilicate glass This configuration might be of special interest for atomic cavityQED experiments, where presence of bulky external couplers may destroy the field symmetry, complicate laser cooling\nof atoms etc ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n\nThis research was supported in part by the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research grant 96-15-96780",
