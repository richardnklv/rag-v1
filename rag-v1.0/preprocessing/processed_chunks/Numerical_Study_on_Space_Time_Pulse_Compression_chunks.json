    "# Numerical Study on Space-Time Pulse Compression\n\n#### Monika Pietrzyk\n\nInstitute of Fundamental Technological Research\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n´Swi¸etokrzyska 21, 00-049 Warsaw, Poland\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nA numerical study of the properties of Gaussian pulses propagating in\nplanar waveguide under the combined effect of positive Kerr-type nonlinearity, diffraction in planar waveguides and anomalous or normal dispersion, is\npresented It is demonstrated how the relative strength of dispersion and\ndiffraction, the strength of nonlinearity and the initial spatial and temporal\npulse chirps effect on the parameters of pulse compression, such as the maximal compression factor and the distance to the point of maximal compression 1\n\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nA compression of optical pulses in Kerr-type nonlinear media have been subject\nto investigation for many years and continues to attract a certain attention [1, 2] In single-mode fibers with anomalous group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and positive\nnonlinearity the pulse compression is based on the mechanism of higher-order soliton\ngeneration [3] In single-mode fibers with normal GVD the pulse compression can\nbe obtained in the configuration with a grating pair [4, 5] In both cases the selfphase modulation (SPM) induced by an intense pulse is used However, the intense\npump pulse propagating together with a weak probe pulse can also cause pulse\ncompression by the mechanisms of the so-called cross-phase modulation (XPM) [6],\nor the induced-phase modulation (IPM) [7] A possibility of pulse compression in non-dispersive nonlinear bulk media due to\nanother nonlinear effect, that of self-focusing, is discussed in [8]-[10] with the aid of\nthe paraxial ray approximation, [8, 10], and by means of the variational analysis,\n\n[9] Still another pulse compression technique that uses the self confinement of\ntwo-dimensional spatial bright solitons propagating in non-dispersive bulk media is\nmentioned in [11], where the two-beam interference technique is used in order to\nensure that a filamentation (a splitting of the beam into many sub-beams) does not\n\noccur Moreover, a simultaneous space-time collapse, which can occur in bulk media\nand in planar waveguides under the combined effect of nonlinearity, diffraction and\nanomalous dispersion, may also be useful for pulse compression [12, 13] This kind\nof collapse gives rise to short pulses with extremely high optical field [14, 15, 16] It\nis realizable both in the case when dispersion and diffraction have comparable effect\non pulse propagation and in the more general case when one of the effects above is\ndominating (see [17]) On the other side, the interplay of normal dispersion and positive nonlinearity\ncauses quite different behavior of the pulse In optical fibers where diffraction terms\nare not included it leads to a monotonic pulse spreading However, the inclusion of\nthe diffraction term, which is necessary for a planar waveguide, can lead to a pulse\ncompression, as it was described in [17, 18] Besides, in planar waveguide, normal\ndispersion slows the self-focusing of the pulse and causes a splitting of the pulse into\ntwo pulses [18, 19] The effect of splitting of a pulse was observed also in the bulk\nmedia [12] In this paper a compression of a pulse propagating in planar, self-focusing nonlinear planar waveguide in the regime of anomalous and normal dispersion is considered The structure of the paper is as follows In Section 2, the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation describing dispersive pulse propagation in nonlinear planar waveguides and the\nparameters of pulse compression are introduced In Section 3, an estimation of the\n\n\n2\n\n\ncondition of pulse collapse is made with the aid of the so-called method of moments\n\n[20] Numerical results describing the influence of the magnitude of nonlinearity, the\nrelative strength of dispersion and diffraction and the spatial and temporal chirp of\nthe initial Gaussian pulse on the pulse compression parameters are discussed in\nSection 4 ### 2 Basic equations\n\n\nIt

    "e a\ncw beam with elliptic Gaussian transverse profile) propagating in a nonlinear bulk\nmedia In this paper we refer to the case of σ = −1 as the cylindrically symmetric\nspatiotemporal pulse; the case of σ ̸= −1 is to be referred to as the asymmetric\nspatiotemporal pulse In the particular case of the cylindrical spatiotemporal pulse a simple analytic\nsolution of the NSE exists which describes a behavior of beam propagating in nonlinear media by means of the variational approximation [14] or by means of the\nscaled complex rays formulation within the so-called ABCD matrix formalism (see\n\n[26, 27]) For the asymmetric spatiotemporal pulse only a semi-analytical approach\nof [24, 25] is known in the literature It is known that some solutions of the two- or three-dimensional NSE can develop into a singularity of the electric field when the initial pulse power exceeds a\ncertain critical value [14] This phenomenon, known as a pulse collapse, can occur\nsimultaneously in space and time for a pulse propagating in planar waveguide with\nthe anomalous GVD [14, 15], and also for a dispersion-less beam propagating in\nself-focusing bulk medium This singularity, however, is obviously non-physical, for\nit emerges just as an artifact of the paraxial approximation made when deriving\nthe NSE In order to avoid this limitation, either a non-paraxial treatment of the\nprocess of self-focusing [28] or some other effects, such as the nonlinear absorption\nand the saturation of the nonlinear refractive index, should be taken into consideration From another hand, the appearance of a non-physical singularity in numerical\nsimulations based on NSE can serve as an indication to the real collapse taking place\nin the certain point of space This is in fact the criterion used in Section 4 Studying the details of developing the pulse collapse we leave beyond the scope\nof this paper Instead, our task is to determine the values of the parameters σ and\n\n\n4\n\n\nN [2] for which the pulse collapse can occur For this purpose the so-called method of\nmoments [29] could be used However, it gives only an estimation of the sufficient\nconditions of the pulse collapse, whereas the latter can occur, in fact, at the earlier\ntimes or on the shorter propagation distances [10] More precise conditions will be\nobtained by means of the numerical simulations presented in Section 3, (cf also\n\n[14])\n\n### 3 Sufficient conditions of pulse collapse\n\n\nThe method of moments originates from the paper of Vlasov e a [29]",
    "[29] It can be\nused as an approach to the determination of whether a given initial wave pulse can\ncollapse to a singular point in a finite period of time [30] An application of the\nmethod of moments to the NSE may be found in [20] In order to formulate the condition of collapse in terms of the strength of nonlinearity, N [2], and the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction, σ, we first\nintroduce the second moment of intensity\n\n\n\n∞\n\n\n¯\n(ξ [2] + ¯τ [2] )|U| [2] dξdτ,\n\n�\n\n\n−∞\n\n\n\nI(ζ) =\n\n\n\n∞\n�\n\n\n−∞\n\n\n\nwhere U is a solution of the NSE given by Equation 1, with the normalization\n\n¯\nτ = (−σ) [−] 2 [1] τ, (σ ̸= 0) Parameter I can be interpreted as effective beam size measuring the size of the\narea to which most of the energy is confined Assuming that U decay suitably as r →∞, one can obtain [20]\n\n\nd [2] I\n(3)\ndζ [2] [ = ¨][I][ = 4][E]\n\n\nwhere E is the Hamiltonian of the NSE\n\n\n\nE =\n�� []\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n∂U(ξ, ¯τ )\n\n\n∂τ¯\n\n�����\n\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\ndξdτ\n\n\n\n\n�����\n\n\n\n2\n+ [1]\n\n2\n\n\n\n�����\n\n\n\n2\n− [1]\n\n2 [N] [2] [|][U][(][ξ,][ ¯][τ] [)][|] [4]\n\n\n\n2\n\n [1]\n\n\n\n∂U(ξ, ¯τ )\n����� ∂ξ\n\n\n\nBecause E remains constant during a pulse propagation, i e it is independent of ζ,\nEquation 3 may be integrated twice to give :\n\n\nI(ζ) = 2Eζ [2] + I [˙] (0)ζ + I(0),\n\n\nwhere I [˙] = [dI]\n\ndζ [ ]\n\n\n5\n\n\nIf the right-hand side of the above equation vanished, then the pulse width (both\nspatial and temporal) will decrease to zero in a finite distance leading to beam\ncollapse Therefore a sufficient condition for collapse can occur if the following\nconditions are satisfied [20, 22, 30]:\n\n\nE < 0,\nE = 0 and I˙(0) < 0, (4)\n\nE > 0 and I˙(0) < − � 8EI(0) For Gaussian input pulse, given by Equation 2, Hamiltonian E can be expressed\nin the following form\n\n\n\nE = [1]\n\n2\n\n\n\n¯ ¯\nξ [2] − σ [2] τ [2] [�] e [−][ξ] [2] e [−][σ][τ][¯] [ 2] − N [2] e [−][2][ξ] [2] e [−][2][σ][τ][¯] [ 2] [�] dξdτ = [1] √\n���� 4\n\n\n\n−σπ(1 − σ − N [2] ) In the particular case of flat phase front, C ξ = C τ = 0, we obtain that I [˙] (0) = 0\nand because of this two last criterion in Equation 4 are not satisfied The first\ncriterion, E < 0, yields\nN [2]          - 1 − σ (5)\n\n\nEquation 5 may be considered as the sufficient condition of the pulse collapse in\nterms of the strength of nonlinearity, N [2], which is proportional to the peak amplitude, |U 0 | [2], and the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction, σ The magnitude\nof the parameter N [2] which is sufficient for the pulse collapse to occur increases linearly with |σ| This is not unexpected because the collapse of the pulse occurs\nwhen the self-focusing caused by the nonlinearity dominates over the broadening of\na pulse, which is due to the diffraction and dispersion It is obvious that for smaller\nvalues of the parameter |σ| is, the influence of the dispersion on the pulse broadening\nis weaker Note that the sufficient conditions of pulse collapse can be formulated also in\nterms of the critical initial power P c of the pulse as follows [22, 25]\n\n\n\n1\n|σ| +\n� |\n\n\n\nP c\n\n=\nP 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n|σ|\n\n\n\n ≥ 1,\n\n\n\nwhere P c (σ) = � |U| 2 dτdξ¯ = π|U 0 | 2 1\n√ |σ| [,][ P] [0] [ = 2][π][ is the initial power of the cylindri-]\n\ncally symmetric pulse (i e σ = 1) We conclude that the decrease of the parameter |σ| leads to the decrease of the\ncritical amplitude, |U 0 | [2], and to the increase of the critical power, P c Note, that the collapse criteria obtained with the aid of the method of moments\nfor the particular case of the spatiotemporal symmetric pulse agrees with the result\nof the variational approximation in [10, 14] 6\n\n\n### 4 Numerical results and discussion\n\nIn this Section, the results of numerical solution of the 2+1 dimensional NSE by\nmeans of the well-known Split-Step Spectral Method (SSSM) [31] with the two\ndimensional (2d) Fast Fourier Transform [32] are presented The calculations on\nthe two-dimensional grid with 512 × 512 points (transverse steps, ∆ξ = ∆τ = 0 08)\nand with the longitudinal step depending on the nonlinearity so that for N [2] = 1,\n∆ζ = 0 01, were performed",
    "01, were performed Because of the lack of spatial-temporal cylindrical\nsymmetry of the problem it is not possible to simplify calculations by reducing the\n2d Fast Fourier Transform to the one dimensional Hankel Transform developed in\n\n[33, 34] Several checks of our numerical procedure were made, which include a\nsimulation of beam propagation in the absence of group-velocity dispersion (σ = 0),\nrepeated testing with different transverse grid and longitudinal step length, and the\nmonitoring of pulse energy during each simulation The latter was kept constant\nwith an error < 0 00005\n\nAs initial conditions in numerical calculations we take Gaussian pulse given by\nEquation 2 First, for the case of anomalous dispersion regime we will compare\nconditions of pulse collapse predicted by method of moments with those obtained\nfrom numerical calculations Further, with the aid of numerical calculations we will\nstudy influence of the strength of nonlinearity, relative strength of dispersion and\ndiffraction and spatial and temporal pulse chirps on pulse compression parameters Above analysis will be perform both for anomalous as well as normal dispersion\nregime Above analysis will be perform both for anomalous as well as normal dispersion\nregime #### 4 #### 4 1 The anomalous dispersion regime\n\n\nIn this section the influence of the parameters σ and N [2] on the pulse collapse and\ncompression will be considered 1 The anomalous dispersion regime\n\n\nIn this section the influence of the parameters σ and N [2] on the pulse collapse and\ncompression will be considered In Fig",
    "In Fig 1, a comparison of the conditions of the collapse of pulse predicted by\nthe method of moments with those obtained by numerical calculations is presented In our numerical procedure the occurrence of pulse collapse was identified with the\ndiscontinuity of the phase φ(0, 0, ζ)) in the central point of the pulse u = |u|e [iφ],\nand with a non-monotonic behavior of the intensity in the central point of the pulse\nafter reaching the collapse point The results of numerical simulation are plotted by\ntwo kinds of points corresponding to the cases when, respectively, the pulse collapse\noccurs or does not occur The prediction of the method of moments is given by the\nstraight line N [2] = 1 − σ, (see Equation 5) The boundary line between the collapse\nand the no collapse regions, obtained from the numerical data is approximately\ndescribed by N [2] ≈ 0 85 − σ It is parallel to the straight line predicted by the\nmethod of moments, unless the absolute value of σ is too small 7\n\n\nTherefore, for both methods, the magnitude of the parameter N [2] which is sufficient for the pulse collapse to occur increase linearly with |σ| The discrepancy\nappears due to the theoretical idealization of the picture of the collapse where all\nthe energy of the pulse goes to the singularity point This also explains why conditions of numerical collapse are typically softer than those predicted by the method\nof moments described in Section 3 Studying details of pulse collapse we leave beyond task of this paper Instead,\nwe will study the influence of the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction,\nthe nonlinearity and the spatial and temporal chirps on the parameters of pulse\ncompression under the condition that the pulse collapse does not occur",
    "Instead,\nwe will study the influence of the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction,\nthe nonlinearity and the spatial and temporal chirps on the parameters of pulse\ncompression under the condition that the pulse collapse does not occur Fig 2 and Fig 2 and Fig 3 represent the results of calculations of the influence of the\nrelative strength of dispersion and diffraction, σ, on the maximal compression factor,\nc max, and on the position of the minimal pulse width, ζ m, for different values of the\nstrength of nonlinearity, N [2] and for Gaussian initial pulse with flat phase front As it could be expected the parameters of pulse compression, c max and ζ m,increase\nmonotonically with the increase of N [2] and the decrease of σ until collapse conditions\nare reached This behavior is obvious from the fact that increase of N [2] cause increase\n\nof pulse self-focusing, it helps to concentrate pulse energy in the center, in addition,\ndecrease of σ cause decrease of dispersion broadening of the pulse This behavior is obvious from the fact that increase of N [2] cause increase\n\nof pulse self-focusing, it helps to concentrate pulse energy in the center, in addition,\ndecrease of σ cause decrease of dispersion broadening of the pulse In Fig In Fig 4 the results of numerical simulations of the influence of the initial spatial,\nC ξ = C, and two cases of temporal, C τ = ±C, chirps on the pulse compression\nparameters are presented In order to distinguish between the above two cases we\nintroduce a parameter\nS = sgn(−C ξ C τ σ),\n\n\nwhich equals 1 for the case of focusing (defocusing) temporal and spatial chirps and\nequals -1 for the case of focusing (defocusing) temporal and defocusing (focusing)\nspatial chirps As it could be expected, the focusing spatial and temporal chirps, C < 0, S = 1,\ncause the increase of the pulse compression parameters The explanation is that\na defocusing chirp spreads the energy out from the center of the pulse, whereas a\nfocusing chirp concentrates it there As the result, the nonlinearity-induced phase\ncurvature of the field is, respectively, reduced or enhanced Similar effect of the\nfocusing chirp of the initial pulse takes place in the region close to the collapse Namely, the focusing spatial chirp can hasten the collapse, whereas a defocusing\nchirp can either delay or eliminate it entirely [17] More interesting is the case of S = −1 (i e the spatial focusing chirp and\nthe temporal defocusing chirp occur simultaneously) The increase of the maximal\ncompression factor occurs only for the case of focusing temporal chirp, C > 0,\nwhereas this is not always true for a spatial focusing chirp C < 0, see Fig",
    "The increase of the maximal\ncompression factor occurs only for the case of focusing temporal chirp, C > 0,\nwhereas this is not always true for a spatial focusing chirp C < 0, see Fig 4 One can conclude that the temporal chirp has larger effect on the temporal pulse\n\n\n8\n\n\ncompression than he spatial one One can expect the reverse situation in the case\nof spatial compression of the pulse One can expect the reverse situation in the case\nof spatial compression of the pulse #### 4 #### 4 2 Normal dispersion regime\n\n\nIn the case of normal dispersion regime the collapse of the pulse doesn’t occur However, due to the the spatiotemporal coupling occurring in nonlinear medium\nwhen both the diffraction and the dispersion effects take place a pulse compression\ncan be obtained [18] In this section we will study the influence of the relative strength of dispersion\nand diffraction, the nonlinearity and the spatial and temporal pulse chirps on the\nparameters of pulse compression In this section we will study the influence of the relative strength of dispersion\nand diffraction, the nonlinearity and the spatial and temporal pulse chirps on the\nparameters of pulse compression It is seen from Fig It is seen from Fig 5 that the maximal compression factor, c max, monotonically decreases with σ, and increases with N [2] It is clear because smaller value of\nthe parameter σ has a weaker influence on the dispersion broadening of the pulse,\nmoreover the increase of N [2] leads to the increase of the spatiotemporal coupling\nand nonlinearity induced phase curvature of the field In the end both effects lead\nto the temporal compression of the pulse",
    "In the end both effects lead\nto the temporal compression of the pulse From Fig From Fig 6 it is seen that for sufficiently small values of σ the parameter ζ m\ndecreases with N [2] However it appears to be practically independent on σ once a\ncertain threshold level of N [2] is reached This fact was explained in [17] by means of\nthe periodic beam narrowing of higher-order spatial solitons A different behavior\ntakes place at larger values of sigma (σ > 0 25) Namely, at first ζ m increases with\nN [2] for sufficiently small N [2] and then it slowly decreases after reaching a maximal\nvalue at the certain value of N [2] This behavior is explainable by the fact that at\nsmall nonlinearities the effects of dispersion prevent a creation of spatial solitons This behavior is explainable by the fact that at\nsmall nonlinearities the effects of dispersion prevent a creation of spatial solitons In Fig In Fig 7 the results of numerical calculations of the influence of the initial pulse\nchirp on the parameters of pulse compression c m and ζ m are presented The focusing\nspatial and temporal chirps, C < 0, S = 1, cause the increase of the compression\nparameters (c max ans ζ max ) and this behavior appears to be similar to that which we\nhave previously observed in Fig 4 for the anomalous dispersion regime However,\nin the case of the anomalous GVD c max grows with C much faster that in the case of\nnormal GVD Namely, for the anomalous GVD the maximal compression factor for\na chirped initial pulse with C = −2 is three times larger than that for an initial pulse\nwith flat phase front (C = 0, i e c max (C = −2) = 3 × c max (C = 0) For the normal\nGVD the increase of the c max is rather slow, e g c max (C = −2) = 1 1×c max (C = 0),\nand a saturation of the maximal compression factor occurs for the initial chirps below\n\n−\n2 (see Fig 7) Moreover, for the case of C < 0, S = −1 (i e the spatial focusing chirp and\nthe temporal defocusing chirp) the maximal compression factor increases only for\n\n\n9\n\n\nfocusing temporal chirp, whereas this is not always true for a spatial focusing chirp\nC ξ < 0 ### 5 Conclusions\n\n\nIn this paper, the physical conditions of collapse and compression of dispersive\nGaussian pulses propagating in waveguide with the positive Kerr-type nonlinearity,\ndiffraction and the anomalous or normal dispersion are investigated We determine the values of the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction,\nσ, and the strength of nonlinearity, N [2], for which the pulse collapse can occur For\nthis purpose we first present an estimation given by the method of moments [29] More precise conditions are obtained by means of the numerical simulations based\non the (2+1)-dimensional Nonlinear Schr¨odinger Equation (see Section 4) We characterize a pulse compression by two parameters: the maximal compression factor, c max, and the distance to the point of the maximal compression, ζ m, (see\nSection 2) By means of a numerical simulation we study how these two parameters depend on the parameters N [2] and σ, and the initial spatial and temporal pulse\nchirps We demonstrate that in the regime of both anomalous and normal dispersion\nthe increase of the nonlinearity and the decrease of the relative strength of dispersion\nand diffraction cause the increase of the maximal compression factor Moreover, in\nthe case of anomalous dispersion regime the compression factor is maximal in the\nregion of 1 − σ ∼ [<] N [2] Furthermore, we observe that the increase of the focusing temporal and spatial\nchirps of the initial pulse lead to the increase of the maximal compression factor,\nc max In the case of the anomalous GVD c max grows with chirp, C, much faster\nthat in the case of normal GVD, for which a saturation of the maximal compression\nfactor occurs Moreover, the increase of the focusing temporal chirp might lead, even in the\npresence of the defocusing spatial chirp, to the increase of the maximal compression\nfactor, c max, whereas the defocusing temporal chirp always leads to the decrease of\nc max, even in the case of the focusing spatial chirp It may be concluded, therefore,\nthat the temporal chirp has larger effect on the maximal pulse compression factor\nthan the spatial chirp In reverse, it is expected that the spatial focusing chirp has\nlarger impact on the beam with than the temporal chirp, independently on its sign",
