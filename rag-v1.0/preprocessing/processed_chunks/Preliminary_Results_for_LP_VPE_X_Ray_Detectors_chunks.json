    "The unpolished surface had a dull appearance The diode characteristic shown in Fig[2] shows the\nleakage current of a typical detector from this batch The\nthickness gradient across the wafer did not permit a good\nmask contact and all the guard rings on the detector\nstructures were shorted to the detectors The leakage current\ndensity is much more than 20 nA mm [-2] which is what we\nwould expect for semi-insulating material [[2]] and much\n\n\n\n689\n\n\n\n582\n\n\nhigher than expected for good diodes on epi material This\nis due to a lack of adequate guarding of the structure which\nleads to leakage from the whole layer being measured\ninstead of that due to the detector structure 0\n\n\n-100\n\n\n-200\n\n\n-300\n\n\n-400\n\n\n\nThe growth of the active thickness of the detector in\nLEC material is known to be a linear function of bias The\nbehaviour of depletion depth in the epi material shows the\nusual dependence on the square root of the bias The plot of\n1/C [2] vs bias shown in Fig[4] does not flatten off at any\npoint indicating that the layer does not fully deplete at the\nhighest bias that could be applied before breakdown 3E+20\n\n\n\n-500\n\n\n\n\n\n-600\n\n\n-250 -200 -150 -100 -50 0\n\n\nBias Voltage (V)\n\n\nFig[2] 3mm diameter detector leakage current characteristic at\nroom temperature and -10 °C The capacitance of the detectors was measured at three\nfrequencies to determine the free carrier concentration and\nalso the depletion depth which corresponds to the active\nlayer thickness of the detector No variations in capacitance\nwith frequency at low bias were observed This is not the\ncase with semi-insulating LEC material [[3]] and indicates that\nthe trap concentration in this high growth rate epi-material\nis much lower than in LEC DLTS measurements performed\non this epi material indicate a concentration of 7x10 [14] cm [-3]\nfor the deep level EL2 1E-09\n\n\n\n8E-10\n\n\n\n\n\n6E-10\n\n\n4E-10\n\n\n2E-10\n\n\n0E+00\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\n\nBias Voltage (V)\n\n\nFig[3] C-V measurement for 3mm diameter detector structures at\nlow bias voltage 2E+20\n\n\n2E+20\n\n\n2E+20\n\n\n1E+20\n\n\n5E+19\n\n\n0E+00\n\n\n0 25 50 75 100 125\n\n\nBias Voltage (V)\n\n\nFig[4] Full depletion is never reached due to the high free carrier\nconcentration The measured capacitance was 73 pF at 100 V bias and\n42 pF for 200 V bias for the 3 mm pads These give 20 µ m\nand 27 5 µ m respectively for the depletion layer thickness\nand show the epi-layer to have an effective free carrier\nconcentration of around 3x10 [14] cm [-3] for the diodes that we\n\nmeasured The diodes were also tested as detectors to determine\ntheir charge collection efficiency This is not 100% for LEC\ndetectors but increases linearly with applied bias The\ncharge collection efficiency of the active layer was\nmeasured to be 100% for a variety of X-ray energies and the\ncount rate for a given experimental set-up varied with the\nsquare root of the applied voltage Fig[5] shows the\nmeasured spectrum from a 44 keV Terbium source While\nthe excess current in the present detectors limited the\nenergies that could be resolved from noise to those above\nBa (36 keV), it should not be a problem to resolve X-rays of\nmuch lower energies with well-fabricated detectors S UMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe grown layers are well suited to making high quality\nX-ray radiation detectors The ability to grow thick layers of\nsufficiently high quality in reactors with capacities for many\ntens of wafers per run would make this the material of\nchoice for most X-ray detection/imaging applications of the\nfuture The biggest challenge to be overcome for this\nmaterial is the reduction in free carrier concentration of the\ngrown material as this determines the thickness of the active\n\n\nlayer for any applied bias -- thick layers are only useful if\nthey are fully depleted Fig[5] 44 keV Terbium X-ray spectrum with the epi-layer diode The difficulties in processing due to the surface\nproperties of the wafers do not pose a serious problem Mechanical polishing of the surface will remove most of the\nirregularities if the layer is grown sufficiently thick initially\nto produce a flat surface Mechanical polishing of the surface will remove most of the\nirregularities if the layer is grown sufficiently thick initially\nto produce a flat surface R EFERENCES\n\n\n[1] K Gruter et al , _Journal of Crystal Growth_ **94** (1989)\n607-612 [2] S Beaumont et al , _Nucl Physics_ B (Proc Suppl ) **32**\n(1993) 296-299 [3] S Beaumont et al , _Nucl Instr and Meth _ **A342** (1994)\n83-89"
