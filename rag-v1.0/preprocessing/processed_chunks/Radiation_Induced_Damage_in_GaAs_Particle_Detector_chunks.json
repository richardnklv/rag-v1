Raine and K Smith Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Scotland _Abstract_\n\n\nThe motivation for investigating the use of GaAs as a material for detecting particles in experiments for High Energy\nPhysics (HEP) arose from its perceived resistance to radiation damage This is a vital requirement for detector materials\nthat are to be used in experiments at future accelerators where the radiation environments would exclude all but the most\nradiation resistant of detector types I NTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nGaAs particle detectors were developed for use in the\nexperiments currently being designed as part of the new\naccelerator (the LHC) to be built at CERN, Geneva The\nestimated radiation fluence foreseen for the innermost\nforward tracking layer of the experiment is of the order of\nseveral 10 [14] cm [-2] of particles, consisting of roughly equal\nfluxes of charged hadrons and neutrons with a typical\nenergy of 1 MeV This will be accumulated over the life of\nthe experiment, which is projected to be 10 years GaAs had been proposed as a radiation hard detector\nmaterial for tracking particles in this very forward region,\nwhere the radiation environment will be harshest and\nprecludes the use of standard types of semiconductor\nradiation detectors Extensive studies[1] have already been\ncarried out on the resistance to radiation damange of this\nmaterial using Gamma radiation The purpose of this study\nwas to evaluate the damage from neutrons and charged\nparticles with particular emphasis on pions, as these are\nforeseen to be one of the dominant sources of damage to\nsemiconductor particle detectors at the LHC M EASUREMENTS AND R ESULTS\n\n\nAll the detectors used in this study were 3 mm diameter\ncircular Schottky diodes with a 500 µ m wide guard ring\nseparated by 10 µ m on 200 µ m thick semi-insulating GaAs\nsubstrates The detector operates as a reverse biased diode,\nthe energy deposited by a particle creating electron-hole\npairs which are swept out of the depleted region by the\napplied field, which create a signal in the front-end charge\namplifier The main detector characteristics of interest for\nHEP are the leakage current, the full depletion voltage (Vfd)\nand the charge collection efficiency (cce) The leakage\ncurrent is measured as an I-V characteristic up to the\nbreakdown voltage or until the diode reaches a compliance\ncurrent Vfd is rather more difficult to measure as there is\nincomplete charge collection in the first place This value is\nmeasured by looking for alpha particle detection on the\nback contact as the range of this type of particle is\napproximately 20 µ m in GaAs This effect is also seen on\n\n\n\nthe I-V curve as a knee in the leakage current corresponding\nto an increase in the injection current from the back contact 35\n\n\n30\n\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n\n15\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n\nFluence (10 [13] p/cm [2] )\n\n\nFig[1] Detector leakage current increase vs proton irradiation\nfluence The current increases initially and then remains flat at a\nfactor of 2 higher value in the range of interest The cce of the device is defined as the ratio of the\nmeasured charge to the total charge deposited in the\ndetector by the ionising particle The deposition of energy\nin the bulk of the detector depends on the type of radiation\nused to illuminate the detector Beta particles with an\nenergy of over 2 MeV deposit energy uniformly along their\npath through the detector material with a Landau energy\ndistribution and are known as minimum ionising particles\n(MIPs) The most probable value of this deposited energy is\n56 keV per 100 µ m of GaAs traversed Alpha particles lose\nall their energy close to the surface of the material because\nof their short range (approximately 20 µ m for 5 5 MeV\nalphas from Am [241] ) This property is very useful as it\npermits the contribution to the total charge collected by the\nholes and the electrons to be separated by illuminating the\n\n\ndetector from either side This technique has been used to\nestimate the mean free path for each carrier in the material 0\n\n\n-25\n\n\n\n-50\n\n\n\n\n\n-75\n\n\n-100\n\n|Vfd|Vfd|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n\n-250 -200 -150 -100 -50 0\n\n\n\nPre 1 6\n\n\n\nBias (V)\n\n\n\n3 9 8 9\n\n\nProton Fluence (10 [13]

Villigen, Switzerland were used to irradiate the\nsamples The energy of the neutrons is the typical energy\nexpected for the background neutron flux at the LHC

that used to\nirradiate silicon detectors for similar applications to those\nproposed for their GaAs counterparts The change in leakage current as a function of\nirradiation is of the order of a factor of two over the range\nof interest for all types of irradiation (Fig",
    "The change in leakage current as a function of\nirradiation is of the order of a factor of two over the range\nof interest for all types of irradiation (Fig [1]) This change\nis orders of magnitude lower than that for silicon detectors This is not a cause for concern for the use of GaAs devices\nin the LHC environment, as the leakage current increase\nwould contribute, at most, a 30% decrease in signal to noise\nratio - an effect which is even further reduced by the fast\nshaping times proposed for the LHC experiments The voltage at which full depletion occurs (Vfd) decreases\nwith increasing fluence for all types of charged particle\nirradiation (as illustrated in Fig 2 for protons) and is\nconsistent with a decrease in free carrier concentration\n\nsimilar to the donor removal effect seen in silicon before\ntype inversion From an initial fluence of around 2 x 10 [13] p\ncm [-] [2], V fd falls by about 35% from its pre-irradiation value\nwhich is always around 1 V µ m [-1] of substrate thickness for\nthe type of detectors used in this study At higher fluences\nV fd remains almost unchanged The cce for MIPs is the parameter most affected by\nparticle irradiation The loss of charge is due to the creation\nof radiation induced trapping centres in the bulk These\neither trap the charge created by the traversing particle or\nmodify the electric field within the bulk of the detector so as\nto enhance the trapping efficiencies of the traps present 100\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n|Col1|Neutrons<br>Pions<br>PPrroottoonnss|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n\n0 2 4

by\ndifferent particles has been normalised according to Table 1 The cce of a 200 µ m thick detector, reverse biased at\n200 V, before irradiation is typically >75% which\ncorresponds to a signal greater than 20,000 electrons The reduction of cce with fluence depends on the type\nand energy of the irradiating particle At a bias of 200 V a\n10,000 electron signal is seen for a MIP (~40% cce)

has been shown that the signal\nfrom holes falls faster with increasing fluence than that\nfrom electrons and so the MIP signal after irradiation is\nmainly due to the electron signal If the bias is increased the\nsignal begins to increase again and this is due to a further\nincrease in the electron signal as shown in Fig[3] The differing effects from each type of irradiation on the\ncce can be attributed to the differing amounts of nonionising energy loss (NIEL) as the particles pass through the\ncrystal lattice Fig[4] shows the correlation between cce for\n200 µ m thick detectors measured at 200 V and the\ncalculated NIEL[2,3] for the various particles used in this\nstudy The damage attributed to each particle type has been\nweighted by its relative NIEL and the calculated energy loss\nis well correlated with the observed damage The radiation\ninduced defects in the crystal may be reduced by thermal\nannealing Arsenic anti-site defects introduced by\nirradiation have been shown to anneal at temperatures above\n450°C [3] Detectors were thermally annealed at 450°C in a\nrapid thermal annealer after exposure to 1 x 10 [14] p cm [-2] The electron signal increased as shown in Fig[5] but that\ndue to the holes hardly changed The response to MIPs, as\nillustrated in Fig [6], gave an increase in cce to 50% at a\nbias of 300 V D ISCUSSION\n\n\nThe radiation damage measured in GaAs particle\ndetectors correlates very well with calculated values of\nNIEL for different particle types The exponential decrease\nin charge collection efficiency with increasing integrated\nNIEL cannot easily be explained, as it depends on too many\nparameters which cannot be measured in isolation In Si\ndetectors the displacement cross section for protons,\n\n\n\nneutrons and pions has been found to be almost the same\nvalue for each particle at the energy of interest[5] In the\ncase of GaAs detectors this is not so and a factor of almost 4\nhas been measured in the damage caused by equivalent\nfluxes of neutrons and pions, with protons causing roughly\nthree times more damage than neutrons 100\n\n\n80\n\n\n60\n\n\n40\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 100 200 300

that the particle equivalence which applies to\nSilicon detectors is not valid for GaAs based detectors The\nGaAs detectors have a greater radiation hardness to neutron\nirradiation than Silicon but are more susceptible to damage\nfrom charged particle irradiation Indeed, recent studies\nwith Silicon detectors show increased hardness by using\nharder design rules and subtle processing improvements [6]\nwhich should enable them to be used in the harshest areas of\nthe LHC experiments for the duration of the project S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe irradiation studies show that a large signal loss is\npresent in the detectors at high levels of incident charged\nhadron fluence This damage is consistent with increased\nnon-ionising energy loss from the charged particle\nirradiation Post irradiation annealing helps to recover some\nof the lost charge by annealing out an electron trap Further\nstudies are taking place in an attempt to improve
