reflection\nof X-ray beam from rough surface\n\n\nT A Bobrova, L I I Ognev\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nA new method for investigation of X-ray beam propagation in a rough\nnarrow dielectrical waveguide is proposed on the basis of the numerical\nintegration of the quazioptical equation In calculations a model rough\nsurface is used with the given distribution of hights of roughness and\ngiven correlation properties of the surface The method is free from\nthe limitations such as infiniteness of the surface length and plane wave\napproximation which are nessesary for application of Andronov- Leontovich method Our method can be applied to any surface with given\nnonhomogeniety and distribution of transitional layer Key words: numerical simulation, X-ray radiation, rough surface\n\n\nIn the middle of 1970-s the experiments on chanalization of soft Xrays [1] and middle range X-rays [2] in glass tubes and also for filtering\nof hard part of X-ray radiation in bent tubes bundles [3] The workability of such systems was demonstrated for transport of X-ray radiation Later the interest to this manner of X-ray steering was connected with\nthe suggestion to use the samples of many specially bent tubes for geometrical focusing and concentrating of X-ray beam [4] The experiments\nwere performed for transmission of X-ray beam through ”gap-less collimator” - micron gap betwean two tightly pressed together glass plates\n\n[5, 6] The revival of interest to localizing of X-rays in thin glass capillaries of changing diameter in the condition of total external reflection\nat grazing incidence on smooth surface was connected with the attempts\nof microfocusing in a narrowing tube [7] (till 7µm) or in a narrowing\npolycapillary system [8], consisting of a great number of melted-in together thin glass tubes forming one hexahedral block The problems of\nthe structure of the focus of such system deals with the work [9] The channalisation of X-ray radiation in hollow glass tubes is possible due to the effect of total external reflection [10] The dielectric\npermeability of substance for electro-magnetic radiation with the energy\nhigher than binding energy of electrons in atoms can be approximately\nwritten with the use of plasma frequency ω p [4]\n\n\nǫ(ω) = 1 − (ω p /ω) [2] Because in X-ray energy range ǫ(ω) < 1 and optical density of glass\nis smaller than the vacuum (or air) optical density the effect of total\nexternal reflection takes place when the rays come from outside and for\nthis reason is called total external reflection (TER) When X-ray radiation comes on sufficiently smooth surface in the\nconditions of TER the radiation penetrates only at small depth of the\norder of 60 A [˚], that maintains the effective reflection and channalisation\nof radiation in hollow glass tubes Besides of the absorption the effectiveness of reflection depends strongly\non the scattering of radiation on roughness of the surface The most of\nthe results on the influence of roughness on the reflection of X-ray radiation from surfaces were obtained in the approximation of Andronov\nand Leontovich [11] The revue of the results can be found in [12] The\napproximation is based on the suggestion that the initial wave coming on\nthe surface is a plane wave and the scattered wave can be found for small\nperturbations of the boundary between two media That is why the investigation of scattreing of wave coming on absorbing surface at small\n\n\n1\n\n\nangles is interesting because in this case the Andronov and Leontovich\napproximation apparentely can not be applied any longer ### 1 The derivation of master equation Maxwell equations are [13]\n\n\n\n\n[ǫ] ∂E\n\nc ∂t\n\n\n\nc [E][,]\n\n\n\nrotH = [ǫ]\n\n\n\n∂tE [+ 4][πσ] c\n\n\n\n\n[µ] ∂H\n\nc

x, y and longitudinal coordinate z [13] The evolution along\nthe direction z is much slower than along transversal coordinates Thus\nafter substituting of (2) into wave equation (1) we can neglect

2\n\n\n### 2 The method of simulation of rough sur- face Under the total external reflection at grazing incidence of X-ray beam\nthe most important is scattering within the plane of incidence because\nthe scattering withing the plane of the interface is small [12] First of\nall it is due to the fact that the wavelength of the radiation is much\nsmaller than the characteristic scale of inhomogeneities That is why\nfor simulation of scattering of X-rays at TER conditions it is enough to\naccount for only scattering in the plane of incidence within 2-dimensional\nmodel In this case the value δǫ in the right side of equation (3) becomes\nthe function of coordinates z and x :\n\n\n\n0, x > ξ(z)\nδǫ(x, z) =\n� ǫ − ǫ 0, x < ξ(z)\n\n\n\n,\n�\n\n\n\nwhere the function ξ(z) is the hight of the rough surface profile and can\nbe regarded as a random value (see Fig 1()) Stationary random value on the interval (0, Z) can be expanded in\nthe Furier specious [14]:\n\n\n\nξ(z)

equation (1) was used earlier for\nstudy of motion of channeled electrons in single crystals [15] and reflection of positrons from slanting cut single crystals [16] The method implies step by step calculation of the amplitude of the X-ray wave A(x, z)\nalong the surface of reflection starting from its initial value at z=0 For simulation of a rough surface the code was constructed calculating random sequence of numbers ξ(n) in accordence with representation\n(5) With the given correlation function by relationship (4) the amplitudes E k of spectral components were determined For simulation of\nrandom phase α k random numbers generators were used Fragments\nof random surface ξ(n) is presented on on Fig 1(a) With account of\nseveral realisation of numerical process with different number of points\ncorreletion functions were calculated again along with propability density distribution On Fig 1(b) the comparison of given correlation\nfunction (curve 1) and correlation functions calculated with realisation\nof n=1000 points (curve 2) and n=10 000 points (curve 3 that nearly\ncoinsides with 1) It is obvious that with the increase of n correlation\nfunction of the process ξ(n) approaches the given function It was also\nshown that the distribution of the propability density for random process ξ(n) approaches Gaussian distribution when the number of points\nin the realisation increases (Fig 1(c)) 4\n\n\nSo we can affirm that the created code simulates random surface with\nthe given statistical characteristics and Gaussian propability density distribution The calculations were made for the radiation with the energy 10 keV\nand for interaction with rough glass surface The width of the correlation\nfunction was chosen 5µm The angle of total external reflection is ϕ c =\n3 · 10 [−][3] rad When the angle of incidence of X-ray wave is not zero the surface can\nbe regarded as infinite and incident wave as a plane wave",
    "When the angle of incidence of X-ray wave is not zero the surface can\nbe regarded as infinite and incident wave as a plane wave On Fig 2 the\ndistribution of the intensity of the radiation along the coordinate x (the\naxis x is perpendicular to the surface) for reflection from smooth surface\nfor the angle of incidence ϕ = 10 [−][3] rad The range 0 < x < 2100A [˚]\ncorresponds to the substance layer The oscillations of the intensity\nare caused by the interference of incident and mirror reflected waves At some distance from the surface that is defined by numerical scheme\nparameters the amplitude was smoothly truncated that is dependent on\nthe use of the Furier transformation on the x coordinate for solving the\nequation (3) (see Fig 2) With the increasing of roughness amplitude the angular spectrum of\nthe reflected beam the mirror reflected beam decreases and at the same\ntime numerous random maxima arise so that clear interference diffraction picture disappears near the surface Simple estimate for roughness\ntolerance of total external reflection observation was given in [17]\n\n\nh ≤ λ 0 /8ϕ 0,\n\n\nwhere λ 0 is the radiation wavelength As a clear illustration of inverse\ndependence of tolerable roughness amplitude on the incidence angle can\nbe used angular spectra of reflection shown on Fig As a clear illustration of inverse\ndependence of tolerable roughness amplitude on the incidence angle can\nbe used angular spectra of reflection shown on Fig 3 The spectra were\ncalculated for angles 0 5 · 10 [−][3] rad (a),10 [−][3] rad (b), 2 · 10 [−][3] rad (c) for\nthe same roughness amplitudes 200A [˚] (here and further the mean squared\nroughness amplitude is used) In the first case the influence of roughness\non the spectrum is small but in the last case the mirror reflected peak\ncan not be observed in practice The calculations of the distribution of the intensity of radiation near\nthe smooth reflecting surface can show the depth of penetration of Xrays into the surface under the conditions of TER as a function of the\nincidence angle and for ϕ = 10 [−][3] rad it is 60A [˚], for ϕ = 10 [−][4] rad - 10 A [˚] For reflection from rough surfaces the depth of penetration (counted\nfrom the mean value of the roughness) is approximately equal to the\nmean squared amplitude of roughness 5\n\n\nWith the created complex of codes calculations were performed for\ntransmission of X-ray radiation in a 2-dimentional rough capillary for\nzero and near to zero entrance angles Transversal dimensions of capillaries were chosen 1 − 2µm, that caused diffractional spreading of the\nplane wave to the values 0 5 · 10 [−][4] − 10 [−][4] rad The length was chosen as\n1 − 2cm On Fig",
