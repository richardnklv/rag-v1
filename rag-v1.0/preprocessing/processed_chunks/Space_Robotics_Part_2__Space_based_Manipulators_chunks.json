    "On-orbit servicing has considerable potential for commercial applications in providing a space-based\ninfrastructure (Ellery, A , Welch, C , & Curley, A , 2001) It has been suggested that the European Robotic\n\n\n213\n\n\nArm (ERA) on the ISS might be used to support astronomy missions by upgrading their instruments as an\nISS-based servicer manipulator (Ellery, A It has been suggested that the European Robotic\n\n\n213\n\n\nArm (ERA) on the ISS might be used to support astronomy missions by upgrading their instruments as an\nISS-based servicer manipulator (Ellery, A 2003) **2 On-Orbit Servicing**\nThe Solar Maximum Repair Mission (SMRM) of 1984 was the first demonstration of on-orbit servicing by\nastronauts in combination with software workarounds uploaded from the ground, and teleoperation of the\nShuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) by an astronaut The Solar Maximum Repair Mission\nrepresents a \"textbook\" case of OOS, involving the exchange of ORU (Orbital Replacement Unit) modules Although the more complex tasks were performed by astronauts on EVA (extravehicular activity), such\nservicing operations may potentially be performed by robotic servicers The repair and servicing of the\nHubble Space Telescope and other US astronaut activities have further demonstrated the feasibility of spacebased servicing tasks Indeed, robotic servicing was an instrumental part of the early stages of the ISS\nprogramme in which two concepts were proposed to perform these functions - the Flight Telerobotic\nServicer (FTS) and the Orbital Maneouvring Vehicle (OMV) - but these were cancelled in the face of budget\ncuts NASA's AERCam (Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic CAMera) represents a step in this direction –\nAERCam is a small 35 cm diameter freeflying sphere comprising a camera for aiding astronaut EVA,\nthrusters for attitude and translation control, and avionics developed from astronaut MMU (manned\nmaneouvering unit) technology The addition of robotic manipulators onto a larger spacecraft platform\nwould offer freeflyer servicer capabilities The sizing of the manipulator would be determined by EVAequivalence, one example of which is the proposed ESA dextrous robot manipulator system:\n\n1 Seven degrees of freedom (three degrees of freedom at the shoulder, one degree of freedom at the\nelbow, and three degrees of freedom at the spherical wrist)\n\n2 Three fingered end effector with cylindrical dimensions 10 x 15 cm\n\n3 Control set-point rate of 100 Hz\n\n4 Forward reach of 1m - this requires multiple grappling points on the target as full reachability around\nmost satellites would require a reach of 4 5 - 16 m which is impractical\n5 End effector position accuracy of 0 3 mm/0 1 [o ]\n\n\n6 Maximum end effector velocity of 0 1 m/s and 0 1 rad/s\n7 Structural displacement compliance of 1x10 [6] N/m and rotational compliance of 5x10 [4] Nm/rad\n\n8 Force/torque exertion of 200 N and 20 Nm respectively\n\n9 Payload capacity of 500 kg in microgravity environment\n\n\nFig 1 ATLAS robotic servicer concept Fig 2 Single arm version of the robotic servicer\nkinematics and dynamics (courtesy Praxis Publishers)\n\n\n214\n\n\nThe Japanese ETS (Engineering Test Satellite) VII of 1996 has demonstrated many of the basic technologies\nfor robotic on-orbit servicing, including autonomous rendezvous and docking to a target, teleoperated\nmanipulator movement control whilst maintaining stable attitude, and vision/force feedback based peg-inhole tasks All robotic servicers will be required to grapple the target spacecraft for retrieval, resupply of\nconsumables, repair, or retrofit In the US, one of the most advanced servicer concepts is Ranger for which a\nneutral buoyancy test vehicle has been developed One proposal for such a robotic servicer is 1 5 tonne\nATLAS (Advanced TeleRobotic Actuation System) – see Fig 1 :\n\n**3",
    ":\n\n**3 Control of Space Manipulators**\nOn-orbit servicing robotics is a modern version of an old field that stems back to the origins of science itself\n– Newton (1642-1729), Euler (1707-1783), d’Alembert (1717-1783), Lagrange (1736-1813), Laplace (17491827) and Hamilton (1805-1865) all contributed to the development of mechanics and dynamics The\nprimary differentiating characteristic of on-orbit servicing robotics from terrestrial robotics is that the robotic\nservicer operates in microgravity Whereas the terrestrial manipulator is mounted onto _terra firma_, in space\nthere is no such reaction force and torque cancellation – the motion of the manipulator(s) will generate\nreaction forces and moments on the spacecraft at the manipulator mounting point(s) Robotic freeflyer\nmanipulators are difficult to control as the spacecraft platform moves in response to the manipulator\nmovements A free-floating platform no longer permits the use of the base of the manipulator as the inertial\ncoordinate frame of reference If this effect is not taken into account, the manipulators will overshoot the\ntarget that it is attempting to grapple A similar effect occurs with astronauts in the microgravity\nenvironment of space They undergo changes in psychomotor performance and posture and their limb\nmovements tend to overshoot their targets until the astronaut's brain has adapted to the new microgravity\nconditions (normally within two to three days) The robotic manipulator control system must similarly\ncompensate for operating in microgravity while implementing the computationally intensive algorithms for\ntrajectory interpolation, inverse kinematics, dynamics, and force/position control of the end effector We\nmay apply the conservation of momentum to the freeflyer servicer system (assuming a single manipulator\nfor simplicity) in order to apply constraints to solve the problem, which allows us to define the centre of\nmass of the whole system to lie at the origin of the inertial reference frame - see Fig",
