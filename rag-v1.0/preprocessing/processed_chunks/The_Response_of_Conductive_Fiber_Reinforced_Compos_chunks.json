    "Fewer work deals with the response to electric loading of electrically conductive\ncomposites, as, for example, in the case of a composite in which one of the phases is electrically\nconductive (e g , carbon fibers) In such a case, as a result of the application of electric field,\nelectric current flows in the conductive phase, inducing magnetic field distribution, as well as\ntemperature increase The magnetic field gives rise to the so-called ponderomotive, or generalized Lorentz force, which, along with the corresponding temperature distribution, generates\nmechanical deformation The main challenge in addressing the aforementioned type of problems is the proper description of Maxwell’s equations and the associated Maxwell tensor, or alternatively, the ponderomotive force and moment couple density, for the case of deforming continua Fundamental\ninvestigations can be found in the work of Tiersten (1971), Pao (1978) and in the recent reviews\nof Hutter et al (2006) and Santapuri et al (2013) (2013) Beyond the establishing of the constitutive and governing equations of the aforementioned\n’multi-physics’ problem, there arise mathematical issues pertinent to the specifics of the field form\nof Maxwell’s equations In the case of slow electromagnetic dynamics, the main issue is related to\nthe fact that the electric and magnetic fields each have to satisfy multiple differential equations In the context of numerical solution, this difficulty is usually treated by introducing auxiliary\ngauges, e g the Coulomb gauge, see Zienkiewicz et al (1977), Simkin and Trowbridge (1979) and\nBarton and Cendes (1987), for example Another approach is taken in Kudryavtsev and Trashkeev\n(2013), where a hyperbolic system of evolution equations is derived with no auxiliary differential\nequations to impose Computationally, the coupled multiphysics response of composite materials for general threedimensional domains is normally derived using the finite element formalism, see Sridhar et al",
    "Computationally, the coupled multiphysics response of composite materials for general threedimensional domains is normally derived using the finite element formalism, see Sridhar et al (2015) for a recent example In the case of plates, the coupled problem is solved by integrating the\nplate equations using finite difference discretization, in conjunction with the Love-Kirchhoff, as in\nZhupanska and Sierakowski (2007), Zhupanska and Sierakowski (2011), Barakati and Zhupanska\n(2014) or the von K´arm´an approximation, as in Librescu et al In the case of plates, the coupled problem is solved by integrating the\nplate equations using finite difference discretization, in conjunction with the Love-Kirchhoff, as in\nZhupanska and Sierakowski (2007), Zhupanska and Sierakowski (2011), Barakati and Zhupanska\n(2014) or the von K´arm´an approximation, as in Librescu et al (2003) In Librescu et al In Librescu et al (2003), the dynamic response of a plate reinforced by electrically conducting fibers is considered As a result of the nonlinear dependence of the mechanics on the\nmagnetic field, linearization is performed, based on the assumption of small disturbances In\nBarakati and Zhupanska (2014) on the other hand, a similar setting is assumed, also for plate\ndynamics, however without the small disturbances assumption A different model for the ponderomotive force is used, and much as in Librescu et al (2003), uniform material, rather than a\ncomposite, is considered (2003), uniform material, rather than a\ncomposite, is considered The solution is obtained by a finite difference method The solution is obtained by a finite difference method The purpose of the present article is three-fold First, to perform quantitative investigation\nof the effect of the correction for the ponderomotive force, relatively to the standard expression of the Lorentz force, which is established for the particle-in-vacuum case",
    "First, to perform quantitative investigation\nof the effect of the correction for the ponderomotive force, relatively to the standard expression of the Lorentz force, which is established for the particle-in-vacuum case To this end we\nfollow Santapuri et al To this end we\nfollow Santapuri et al (2013) in choosing the Maxwell-Minkowski model, reduced for the linear\nquasistatic regime The framework for the examination of the aforementioned effect is that of\n\n\n3\n\n\nunidirectional deformation of a two-constituent composite specimen The second perspective in\nwhich the present work is performed is computational To this end, the Higher Order Theory\n(HOT), as in Aboudi et al (2013), which has been employed for the analysis of functionally\ngraded materials, is generalized to account for electric-current-induced mechanical deformations In the framework of the HOT, the governing equations together with the interfacial and boundary\nconditions are imposed in the average (integral) sense It should be noted that since the HOT\nis a strong-form approach to the solution of boundary-value problems, the present work opts to\nconstruct a strong-form computational apparatus for the analysis of the multi-physics response of\ncomposites in the linear quasistatic regime In the third perspective, the present paper in effect\nproposes a sensor/actuator with the accompanying computational apparatus, which will have\nthe effect of nonlinear response to either electric field or electric field gradient, in line with the\nview presented in Santapuri et al In the third perspective, the present paper in effect\nproposes a sensor/actuator with the accompanying computational apparatus, which will have\nthe effect of nonlinear response to either electric field or electric field gradient, in line with the\nview presented in Santapuri et al (2015) The details of these perspectives are further discussed\nin the concluding section To elaborate on the third perspective, the present article offers a coupled electro-magnetothermo-mechanical analysis for the prediction of the mechanical deformation of partially conductive composites, caused by the application of electric field The engineering motivation for this\nanalysis can be illustrated by the following discussion Consider a setting (e g",
    "g a large capacitor),\nin which a uniform electric field exists It is then assumed that a local effect (perturbation –\na small relative change in the field but with a high local gradient, as created by a small conducting object) has been introduced, as a result of which the electric field loses its uniformity The present analysis shows that a device (sensor) in the form of a ring that consists of, say, two\nconductive wires embedded in a polymeric (insulation) matrix, will reveal the effect by showing\nthe induced mechanical deformation This deformation, caused jointly by the Joule heating and\nthe ponderomotive force, can be calibrated to estimate the intensity of the perturbation-induced\nlocal electric field gradient Such a (partially conducting) ring would be advantageous over,\nsay, a piezoelectric sensor in that it would sense the finite electric field gradient rather than\nthe nearly uniform local field itself High accuracy of the device-calibration would be obtained\ndue to the offered analysis, owing to it being based on strong-form solution of the equations\n(which is possible for linear constitutive relations) It should be noted that a sensor in the form\nof a ring is a three-dimensional object, and a 3D imperfectly conducting ring in a non-uniform\nelectric field develops a current, see Assis et al (1999) (1999) It is also shown in that article that the\nexpressions for the 3D corrections to the electric field in the ring become negligible for a slender\nwire Consequently, in the limiting case of a slender ring-wire the applicability of the present 2D\nanalysis is justified In the present article, the analysis of mechanical deformation generated by the application\nof externally applied electric field on electrically and thermally conducting fiber-reinforced composites is considered The composite material is assumed to consist of continuous fibers that\nare distributed in the matrix, forming a symmetric array The electric field is applied in the\nfibers’ direction, and the boundaries of the composite are assumed to be traction-free and thermally convective The composite region is divided into a double array of subcells The magnetic\nfield induced by the applied electric field is derived, and the resulting ponderomotive force is\nestablished Next, the equations that govern the thermal problem related to the heat generated\nby the electric current are established and solved numerically, to obtain the temperature field\ndistribution and its gradient Finally, the mechanical deformations of the composite phases are\nobtained from the solution of a system of sparse algebraic equations, following the HOT ap\n\n4\n\n\nproach The presented derivation is illustrated for the case in which uniform (throughout the\ncomposite domain) electric field is applied to a thermally conductive polymeric matrix (epoxy)\nreinforced by two iron fibers, which are both electrically and thermally conductive The solution\ndemonstrates the distributions of the magnetic, thermal and mechanical fields created by the interaction between the two fibers It should be emphasized, however, that the present theory can\nbe generalized to establish the response of any number of fibers of identical or different properties\nand cross-section Such generalization would affect only the computational complexity caused\nby the increase in the number of subcells (a) H\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n|Col1|~ 0|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n||||\n\n\n\n\n\nx 2\n\n\nSubcell ( �� )\n\n\n\nE 0\n##### E= ~ [ ]

discussed\nin Section 8 The conclusions section, Section 9, provides overall discussion of the derived theory ### 2 Governing Equations\n\n\nConsider a unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite, in which the fibers are as shown in Fig 11(a) The composite occupies the region −H/2 ≤ x 2 ≤ H/2, −L/2 ≤ x 3 ≤ L/2, and it is\nassumed that the domain is symmetrically occupied with respect to the axes The fibers are\nassumed to be electrically conductive A uniform electric field, namely, E 0 = {E 0, 0, 0} [⊤] is\nacting at the boundary in the out-of-plane x 1 -direction (fibers’ direction), formally ’at ±∞’ As\na result of the existence of the conductive phase, electric current is generated and magnetic field is\ninduced The corresponding temperature increase and ponderomotive force produce mechanical\ndeformation of the composite The governing equations are given by Maxwell’s equations, along with a model for the ponderomotive force, energy balance and mechanical equilibrium (momentum balance), as follows Starting with Faraday’s law for the static regime and Gauss’s law for the case of uncharged\nmaterial:\n\n\n∇· D = 0, ∇× E = 0 (1)\n\n\nwhere D is electric displacement vector and E is the emergent electric field intensity in the\ncomposite, and following by magnetic flux conservation and Amp`ere’s law:\n\n\n∇· B = 0, ∇× H = J (2)\n\n\nwhere B, H and J are the magnetic flux density, magnetic field intensity and electric current\ndensity, respectively The energy balance in the linear elastic quasistatic limit reads:\n\n\n∇· q = J · E (3)\n\n\nwhere q is the heat flux Next, the mechanical equilibrium equation reads:\n\n\n∇· Σ + F = 0 (4)\n\n\nwhere Σ and F are the Cauchy stress tensor and body force-per-unit-volume vector, respectively The corresponding constitutive equations are as follows The magnetization law is assumed\nto be linear, even though in the application section a ferromagnetic material is chosen in order\nto enhance the effect of the ponderomotive force on the deformation The resolution of this\nseeming contradiction is simply the assumption that the magnetic field intensity remains small,\ncorresponding to the assumption of an applied weak electric field excitation at the boundary In\naddition, quasistatic increase of the electric field at the boundary is assumed, which corresponds\nto linear response with no appearance of magnetic hysteresis:\n\n\nB = µ 0 µ r H (5)\n\n\n6\n\n\nwhere µ 0 is the free space permeability and µ r is the constant relative material permeability Ohm’s law in the vanishing material velocity limit and the electric polarization equation in the\nweak field approximation in terms of the electric displacement vector reads:\n\n\nJ = σE, D = ǫ 0 ǫ r E (6)\n\n\nwhere σ is the constant coefficient of electric conductivity and ǫ r is the relative constant electric\npermittivity coefficient of the material, and where ǫ 0 is vacuum permittivity Fourier’s law of\nheat conduction for thermally isotropic materials in the quasistatic limit and small temperature\ngradient/change assumption:\n\n\nq = −κ∇θ (7)\n\n\nwhere κ is the constant scalar heat conductivity of the solid and θ is the temperature field\nmeasured as deviation from a uniform reference temperature Finally, the Cauchy stress tensor\nΣ is related to the small strain tensor ǫ and the temperature deviation θ as follows:\n\n\nΣ = Cǫ − Γθ (8)\n\n\nwhere C and Γ are the constant material stiffness fourth-order and thermal stress second-order\ntensors, respectively The body force-per-unit-volume vector in Eq (4) is the ponderomotive\nforce, representing the macroscopic effect of long-range magnetic dipole interactions Here the\nMaxwell-Minkowski model is taken, following Santapuri et al (2013), which in the linear quasistatic regime takes the following form:\n\n\nF = J × B + µ 0 (µ r − 1)(∇H [⊤] )H + (∇E [⊤] )P (9)\n\n\nwhere P is electric polarization The distributed couple L appearing in the Maxwell-Minkowski\nmodel in the dynamic case vanishes for the quasistatic regime assumed herein, rendering the\nCauchy stress tensor symmetric (see Santapuri (2016)) In the framework of the present two-dimensional analysis, the external electric field is assumed\nto be tangential to the global boundaries Consequently, the electric boundary condition is\nthat of tangential field continuity The magnetic boundary conditions are those of tangential\nfield intensity and normal flux density continuity at the external boundaries The mechanical\nboundary conditions are given by zero tractions imposed at x 2 = ±H/2 and x 3 = ±L/2, together\nwith a suitable displacement pinning to prevent singularity The thermal boundary conditions\nare assumed to be convective The interfacial conditions require the continuity of the tractions\nand normal components of magnetic flux density and heat flux In addition, the temperature,\ndisplacements and tangential electric and magnetic field intensities must be continuous at the\ninterfaces between the phases According to the present method of solution, the composite\nregion −H/2 ≤ x 2 ≤ H/2, −L/2 ≤ x 3 ≤ L/2 is divided into N β and N γ subcells in the x 2 and\nx 3 directions, respectively Each subcell is labeled by the indices (β, γ) with β = 1, , N β and\nγ = 1, , N γ The dimensions of subcell (βγ) are denoted by h β and l γ, and local coordinates\n(y 2 [(][β][)] [, y] 3 [(][γ][)] [) are introduced within each subcell whose origin is located at its center, see Fig 1(b) ]\nIt should be mentioned that the composite materials which are dealt with in the present\narticle are not assumed to possess periodic microstructure Thus a homogenization technique\nand its associated periodic boundary conditions are not employed in the proposed analyses 7\n\n\n### 3 The Electric Field\n\nThe electric problem consists of the combination of Eqs (1) and (6b), and suitable boundary\nconditions The approach followed in the present paper is to divide the spatial domain occupied\nby the composite to subcells containing each only one material In every such subcell, the material properties are uniform and there is no discontinuity in the\nfields Consequently, the differential form of Maxwell’s equations is valid The corresponding boundary conditions are then continuity of the fields along the interfaces\nbetween the subcells In the present electric problem, a possible solution of the aforementioned\nequations is a field E uniform across a given subcell Since the global boundary conditions require the electric field to point in the x 1 direction\nonly, and since the interfaces of a subcell in the x 2 − x 3 plane are oriented perpendicular to x 1,\nclearly if one assumes the electric field for every value of x 1 in the composite to point in the x 1\ndirection, just as the applied field, then the continuity conditions of the tangential components\nof the electric field are satisfied It is known that tangential continuity in electric problems should be enforced on the electric\nfield For materials with different relative permittivities, electric displacement continuity along\nthe interface may result in an electric field that is non-uniform across material boundaries However, since a uniform electric field pointing in the x 1 direction satisfies the differential\nequations in both the fibers and the matrix, and the only interface continuity condition is that this\nelectric field should be continuous across the boundaries as well, evidently the emergent electric\nfield in the composite should be just as if the composite were uniform monolithic material: a\nuniform field in the x 1 direction, insensitive to material boundaries, namely:\n\n\nE = {E 0, 0, 0} [⊤] (10)\n\n\nmuch like the global boundary condition itself Then, clearly, if Eq (10) is a solution, then due\nto linearity it is also the unique solution As for the interpretation of the boundary conditions, two possibilities exist (a) To understand\nthe problem as two-dimensional, straight and extending between minus to plus infinity, with\nprescribed values there (b) Alternatively, to view the system as a ring with a large radius,\nrelatively to the cross-sectional dimensions In this scenario, an external field would be tangential\nto the ring and the material field would be equal to the external field, due to tangential component\nelectric field continuity From the engineering perspective this would actually mean that the external field would have\na large-scale gradient, such that a net current would be created in the composite fiber-reinforced\nring The external electric field gradient would have to be large enough to create finite current\nin the ring, yet small enough to assume approximately uniform field distribution within the\ncross-section of the ring It is in this perspective that one may suggest an electric field gradient\nsensing device, with the accompanying computational apparatus, which would be based on the\nderivation of the magneto-thermo-elastic response, as obtained in the following 8\n\n\n### 4 The Magnetic Field\n\nThe magnetic field intensity H is governed by Eq (2) in conjunction with Eq (5) Let H be\ndecomposed into homogeneous H [h] and particular H [p] parts These parts satisfy:\n\n\n∇· H [h] = 0, ∇× H [h] = 0\n\n∇· H [p] = 0, ∇× H [p] = J = σE (11)\n\n\nIt follows that H [h] can be derived from a harmonic magnetic potential φ [h] such that H [h] = −∇φ [h] It can be verified that H [p] within subcell (βγ) can be uniquely satisfied by:\n\n\n\nH [p][(][βγ][)] = [σ] [(][βγ][)] [E] [0]\n\n2\n\n\n\nT\n0, −y 3 [(][γ][)] [, y] 2 [(][β][)] (12)\n� �\n\n\n\nThis is the Amp`ere solution inside an electric current-bearing wire The harmonic magnetic\npotential can be generated as a four-terms expansion, consistent of harmonic eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplace equation for φ [h] :\n\n\nφ [h][(][βγ][)] = hˆ 1 sin √c 1 y 2(β) cosh √c 1 y 3(γ) + h [ˆ] 2 cos √c 1 y 2(β) sinh √c 1 y 3(γ)\n� � � � � � � �\n�\n\n\nˆ (β) (γ) (β) (γ)\n+ h 3 sinh √c 2 y 2 cos √c 2 y 3 + h [ˆ] 4 cosh √c 2 y 2 sin √c 2 y 3 (13)\n� � � � � � � � [�] [(][βγ][)]\n\n\nThe reason for which the number of free coefficients in the expansion in (13) is four is as\nfollows Since the aim of the present work is to enhance the micromechanical HOT method to\ninclude ponderomotive force effects, and the continuity at the faces of a subcell is enforced in\nthe average sense, clearly, for a 2D subcell, 4 independent coefficients are needed to enforce the\n4 interface conditions on the faces/edges Since the magnetic equations are first order in H,\nonly one condition is needed at one edge of the subcell for each of the two vector components\nof H, and that is for every one of the two spatial directions This gives a total of 4 conditions,\nwhich due to linearity correspond to 4 necessary free coefficients in a feasible expansion for the\nharmonic potential In order for the coefficients to be extractable from the interface conditions,\nthe 4 eigenfunctions have to be orthogonal This can only be achieved if 2D Cartesian harmonic\nfunctions are chosen – hence the function choice in Eq",
    "This can only be achieved if 2D Cartesian harmonic\nfunctions are chosen – hence the function choice in Eq (13) (13) The symmetry between the two spatial directions suggests that the trigonometric/hyperbolic\nfunction choice should be symmetric between the two directions Moreover, since two trigonometric functions are needed, symmetry and the fact that the interface conditions are integral,\nleads to the fact that the entire expansion be represented by the first function, and the other\nthree be complementary through odd/even and trigonometric/hyperbolic flips Hence, there are\nonly two possibilities for the first eigenfunction, namely sin sinh and sin cosh It so happens that\nthe first choice leads to a coupled scheme, which rigorous scheme stability analysis as well as\nnumeric examination show to be algorithmically unstable The second choice, on the other hand,\nproduces a formally stable scheme, which also decouples, enabling the analytical solution of the\nentire magnetic problem, as shown next In a discretized scheme the integral continuity conditions are the physically correct ones, since\nonly integral continuity conditions allow the fulfillment of the Amp`ere and magnetic Gauss laws\n\n\n9\n\n\nover arbitrary loops along subcell lines within the domain Consequently, the proposed scheme\nis the only possible first order consistent and stable discrete integration scheme for the magnetic\nequation with a given transverse current in a composite The subcell interface continuity equations corresponding to the potential given in Eq (13)\nare obtained by integrating H [(][βγ][)] = −∇φ [h][(][βγ][)] + H [p][(][βγ][)], in conjunction with Eq (13), over the\nsubcell edges (the integrated values needed for interface continuity resulting in satisfaction of\nthe integral Amp`ere and Gauss laws for a loop in the discretized specimen) Consequently, the\ncoefficients h [ˆ] [(] 1 [βγ][)], , h [ˆ] [(] 4 [βγ][)] can be established as

(20) implies that components 3 and 4 can be also taken at the opposite global boundary, since the magnetic flux densities should be uniform in the direction in\nwhich they point Thus symmetric global boundary conditions are assumed for the normal magnetic flux density components, i e , a symmetric specimen and hence skew-symmetric tangential\ncomponents’ global boundary conditions The assumption is reasonable, since normal magnetic flux components penetrate the composite remaining unaltered passing through different constituents, due to the fact that normal\nmagnetic flux continuity across interfaces is permeability-independent (unlike for tangential magnetic flux components) Next, in order to obtain the unknown single-index functions in the first two components in the\nright-hand-side of Eq (20), we write them explicitly for the two opposite global boundaries (for\neach of the first two components there), and then solve for the unknowns, using skew-symmetry\nof the tangential field

boundary\nconditions for each subcell, two on each edge, as expected for a Poisson equation The only\ndifference is that this time there are two ’even-even’ functions, in addition to two ’odd-odd’\nfunctions This is due to the fact that in this case one condition is for heat flux continuity,\nwhich is an integral condition, but the other condition is for temperature continuity, which has\nno integral version and is a macroscopically local requirement Moreover, no differentiation is\nrequired, just value setting These two features lead to the choice of two ’even-even’ eigenfunctions, as a means to correctly\nrepresent bidirectional thermal self-coupling in the resulting integration scheme Now, evaluating\nthe temperature at the centers of the edges y 2 [(][β][)] = h β /2, y 3 [(][γ][)] = 0 and y 2 [(][β][)] = 0, y 3 [(][γ][)] = l γ /2, and,\nin addition, integrating the normal heat flux densities along these edges, yields, in conjunction\nwith Eq (32), the

    "Last, the temperature change θ [(][βγ][)] within any subcell (βγ), as\nproduced by the application of an external electric field, E 0, can be determined from Eqs (34)\nand (35) (34)\nand (35) The derived numerical integration scheme appears to be stable (in terms of the recursion\nmapping encompassed in the outlined overall matrix equation comprised of Eqs The derived numerical integration scheme appears to be stable (in terms of the recursion\nmapping encompassed in the outlined overall matrix equation comprised of Eqs (41-43)) (41-43)) ### 6 The Mechanical Field\n\n\nThe method of solution of the mechanical problem is also similar to the HOT approach that\nhas been presented in chapter 11 of Aboudi et al (2013), which deals with functionally graded\nmaterials Presently, however, the incorporation of the ponderomotive force and the temperature\nfield need to be dealt with Thus, the solution of the mechanical problem is based on satisfying\nthe governing equations, continuity and boundary conditions in the average (integral) sense This\nimplies that the equilibrium equation is solved in strong form (i e , not by numerical variational\nminimization) yet in the volume-integral sense Furthermore, the four three-component force\nvectors acting on the edges of a rectangular two-dimensional subcell, are balanced by the threecomponent body force vector acting on the volume of the subcell This results in three equations\nin each subcell In addition, the continuity conditions are enforced in the integral sense, that is\nforces (normalized by edge areas) acting on the edges of adjacent subcells are set equal, which\ngives six more equations for each subcell Finally, the displacements continuity is enforced In\nprinciple, displacements could be made continuous at the centers of the edges, that is locally,\njust as was done in the case of the temperatures in the thermal problem However, unlike the\ntemperature, which is a purely local, intensive state variable in the material, the displacement\n\n\n16\n\n\nis in fact a spatially integrable quantity Consequently, displacement continuity is enforced here\nfor the center-of-edge displacements, that is for the integrals of the displacement field along the\nedge, normalized by the edge length, rather than for the local displacement of the centers of the\nedges",
    "Consequently, displacement continuity is enforced here\nfor the center-of-edge displacements, that is for the integrals of the displacement field along the\nedge, normalized by the edge length, rather than for the local displacement of the centers of the\nedges This gives another six equations, leading to a total of fifteen for a subcell This calls for\nfifteen subcell variables used to interpolate the displacement vector field within the subcell, as a\nquadratic polynomial in two variables (suitable for the plane deformation assumption), without\nthe bilinear term The displacement

    "This owes to the fact that the strains in the epoxy are an order of magnitude higher, which\nin turn results from thermal domination in the strains, along with an order of magnitude higher thermal\nexpansion coefficient in the epoxy Fig 7 shows the mechanical response for E 0 = 0 003 V/m for the case of forced convection with Nu\n= 1000 This case is representative of the purely magnetic effect on strain The temperature increase is\nso small, due to efficient heat transfer, that nearly the entire specimen is in compression in the direction\nof x 2, as shown in Fig The temperature increase is\nso small, due to efficient heat transfer, that nearly the entire specimen is in compression in the direction\nof x 2, as shown in Fig 7(a) 7(a) Perhaps the most interesting feature of the entire example is the short\nstripe of epoxy just between the two fibers, where the compressive strain ǫ 22 is maximal The advantage\nof Fig 7(a) is that it is representative of the macroscopic physics in the Nu≫1 case: two current-bearing\nwires embedded in insulation, attracted to each other, thus compressing the epoxy between them Fig 7(b) shows ǫ 33, in which the prominent feature is the expansive strain in the epoxy circumventing the\nfibers in the region between them, where the ponderomotive force is small in absolute value and the\ncoefficient of thermal expansion is large Fig 7(c) shows the typical picture of extremal shear stresses\nin forty-five degrees to the symmetry axes, only unlike in Fig 6(c), the larger strains are in the middle\nof the specimen, since the strains in the edges are more cylindrical, given that the ponderomotive force\nis compressive in both directions and the thermal strain is an order of magnitude smaller and cannot\nchange the sign of the ratio of the 22 and 33 strain components near the specimen edges Fig 7(d) is\nvery interesting although intuitive It shows distinctive stress concentration in the fibers around the area\nof their contact with the layer of epoxy that separates them This is what one would expect in the case\nof purely attractive forces, which is effectively the situation when there is efficient forced convection\nremoving all current-generated heat One notes the nice round isostress contourlines of atmospheric\nmagnitude in the proximity of the near-contact region Figs",

overestimation of the average compression strain of the\nspecimen This is rather intuitive The surprising part is that although, as shown in Fig 4, the total\nponderomotive force is about half the Lorentz force part, Fig 9 shows that the average strain when\nneglecting the magnetization force part of the ponderomotive force, is not twice larger than the actual\nstrain, but about five times larger (in absolute value) The reason for this apparent discrepancy is in\nthe interplay with thermal expansion, which is still present in the iron fibers even for Nu = 1000 In\nthe case of calculation with the total ponderomotive force, the magnetic part of ǫ 22 in the fibers nearly\ncancels-out the thermal strain there The result is that ǫ 22 in the fibers can add nearly nothing to the\nvolume-averaged value If the magnetization part of the force is neglected, the magnetic strain in the\nfibers overcomes the thermal expansion, and the total negative-strain contribution from the fibers adds\nto the average value This effect is stronger than doubling, since the nearly zero strain exists in the\nrealistic calculation not only in the fibers but almost in the entire specimen except for in a small layer\nbetween the fibers Finally, the strain in the aforementioned layer is also at least doubled when only\nthe ’particle-in-vacuum’ Lorentz force is considered ### 9 Conclusions\n\n\nIn this article, a theory was presented, in which a computational procedure for micromechanical steady\nstate response analysis of a thermally conducting linear elastic composite with electrically conductive\nferromagnetic fibers embedded in an insulating matrix, was derived The crux of the work is the construction of a stable computational scheme for the derivation of the ponderomotive force induced by\nan applied electric field The expression for the force, along with thermal analysis is consequently used\nin conjunction with mechanical analysis The mechanical analysis discretizes the domain into subcells,\nevery one of which is filled with homogeneous material The equations of elasticity are solved for the\n\n\n30\n\n\narray of subcells in strong form – that is not by minimizing a variation of a functional, as in the finite\nelement approach, but by directly solving the boundary value problem Quadratic expansion of the displacement vector within each subcell is employed This approach, although producing a stable solution\nscheme for the elastic problem, does not allow solving the magnetic problem, where quadratic or any\nother standard interpolation produces a singular matrix relation between the interpolation coefficients\nand the edge-averaged values Due to this fact, a different approach was taken here, in which linear\ncombination of point-wise analytical solutions of the differential operator representing the magnetic\nproblem was employed, consequently establishing the coefficients by enforcing local boundary conditions in the integral sense It should be noted that in the case of the magnetic problem, additional\nbenefit was gained from constructing the solution from point-wise analytical solutions of the differential\nequations This gain is embodied in the fact that the introduction of an auxiliary gauge condition, such\nas the Coulomb gauge, became unnecessary, since the magnetic field was not assumed to be the curl of\nan auxiliary vector field, but was rather constructed as the superposition of the Amp`ere solution in a\nconductor and the gradient of a harmonic function This is, of course, only possible in the linear case In the thermal problem, an approach similar to the one taken in the magnetic case was chosen,\nalthough quadratic interpolation and fulfillment of the differential equation only in the integral sense\ncould have been an alternative possible route With the ponderomotive force obtained analytically for each subcell, and the temperature field\nobtained analytically up to four coefficients for each subcell determined numerically, the mechanical\nproblem was solved consistently, enforcing mechanical equilibrium on the subcell level and requiring\ncontinuity of the integral quantities of surface forces on subcell boundaries, as well as spatially integrated\ndisplacements The numerical example solved with the derived theory showed reasonably intuitive results, which\nin itself is a certain validation of the method It was demonstrated that the approach is suitable for the\nmulti-physics analysis of a current-bearing two-wire cable, where ponderomotive and thermal effects\ninterplay is captured quite reasonably Furthermore, it is the assertion of this paper that the derived\ntheory can be used as the computational apparatus for, and in fact suggests a sensing/actuating device\nwith quadratic mechanical response to either uniform electric field, if a straight long wire is considered,\nor the large-scale gradient of electric field, if a two-wire thin ringed cable is considered The present\nanalysis is limited to steady-state response of such a device Future work may extend the analysis to\ninclude transient response Regarding the response to applied electric field, it may also be noted that the ability to respond to\nthe large-scale gradient of electric field, rather than to its local value, which may be obtained in a thin\nringed device (owing to the fact that current will be induced in the ring only in a nonuniform electric\nfield – the local smoothness is required, though, for the electric problem to be solved by an electric field\nuniform throughout the composite’s cross-section), may be useful in sensing/applications where high\nsensing resolution is required",
