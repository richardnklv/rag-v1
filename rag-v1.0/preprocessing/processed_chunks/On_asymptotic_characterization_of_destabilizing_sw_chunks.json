    "ON ASYMPTOTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF DESTABILIZING SWITCHING SIGNALS\n\nFOR SWITCHED LINEAR SYSTEMS\n\n\nATREYEE KUNDU\n\n\nAbstract This paper deals with classes of (de)stabilizing switching signals for switched systems Most of the\navailable conditions for stability of switched systems are sufficient in nature, and consequently, their violation does\nnot conclude instability of a switched system The study of instability is, however, important for obvious reasons Our contributions are twofold: Firstly, we propose a class of switching signals under which a continuous-time\nswitched linear system is unstable Our characterization of instability depends solely on the asymptotic behaviour\nof frequency of switching, frequency of transition between subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems Secondly, we show that our class of destabilizing switching signals is a strict subset of the class of switching signals\nthat does not satisfy asymptotic characterization of stability recently proposed in the literature This observation\nidentifies a gap between asymptotic characterizations of stabilizing and destabilizing switching signals for switched\nlinear systems The main apparatus for our analysis is multiple Lyapunov-like functions 1 Introduction\n\n\nA switched system has two ingredients — a family of systems and a switching signal The switching signal\nselects an active subsystem at every instant of time, i e , the system from the family that is currently being followed\n\n[11, §1 1 2] 2] Switched systems find wide applications in power systems and power electronics, automotive control,\naircraft and air traffic control, network and congestion control, etc Switched systems find wide applications in power systems and power electronics, automotive control,\naircraft and air traffic control, network and congestion control, etc [3, p 5]",
    "5] In this paper we will focus on\ncontinuous-time switched linear systems In this paper we will focus on\ncontinuous-time switched linear systems 1 1 Motivation Motivation It is well-known that qualitative properties of a switched system depends not only on the\nproperties of its individual subsystems, but also on the properties of switching signals In particular, divergent\ntrajectories may be generated by switching appropriately among stable subsystems, while a suitably constrained\nswitching signal may ensure stability of a switched system even if all subsystems are unstable (see e In particular, divergent\ntrajectories may be generated by switching appropriately among stable subsystems, while a suitably constrained\nswitching signal may ensure stability of a switched system even if all subsystems are unstable (see e g , [11, p 19] for examples with two subsystems) Due to these interesting features, the problem of characterizing classes of\nswitching signals that preserve stability of a switched system, has attracted a considerable research attention in the\npast few decades, see [13, 4, 12] for detailed surveys We will restrict ourselves to purely time-dependent switching\nsignals characterized by employing multiple Lyapunov-like functions [2] Research on this topic can be broadly classified into two directions: stability characterization based on pointwise properties of switching signals [15, 5, 16, 10] and stability characterization based on asymptotic properties\nof switching signals [8, 9] In case of the former, stabilizing switching signals obey certain upper bounds on the\nnumber of switches and duration of activation of unstable subsystems on every interval of time, while in case of\nthe latter, stability is characterized based solely on the asymptotic properties of the switching signals Recently in\n\n[9] it was shown that if a switching signal satisfies any of the existing point-wise or asymptotic characterizations\nof stability, then it satisfies certain conditions on the asymptotic behaviour of switching frequency, frequency of\ntransitions between subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems The above body of results is derived by employing multiple Lyapunov-like functions, and is only sufficient in\nnature Consequently, if a switching signal does not obey these stability conditions, we cannot conclude that\nthe resulting switched system is unstable",
    "Consequently, if a switching signal does not obey these stability conditions, we cannot conclude that\nthe resulting switched system is unstable This fact motivates the current work This fact motivates the current work We are interested in instability\ncharacterizations of switched systems using multiple Lyapunov-like functions Instability is an important concept in stability theory This concept is often useful in studying behaviour of\na switched system under failures in system components, adversarial attacks, etc It is known that if a family\nof asymptotically stable systems does not admit a common Lyapunov function, then the family admits at least\none switching signal that is destabilizing In [17] a sufficient condition for existence of a stabilizing switching\nsignal was proposed using matrix pencils Several classes of subsystems that admit destabilizing switching signals\nwere identified This set of results was employed to study the connection between existence of a destabilizing\nswitching signal and non-existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function in [6] This set of results was employed to study the connection between existence of a destabilizing\nswitching signal and non-existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function in [6] In [19] a necessary but not\n\n\nDate: May 18, 2020 In [19] a necessary but not\n\n\nDate: May 18, 2020 1\n\n\n2 ATREYEE KUNDU\n\n\nsufficient condition for instability of a planar switched linear system was proposed by employing flow relations of the\nconstituent subsystems and construction of invariant sets Instability of stochastic switched systems under arbitrary\nswitching was addressed in [20] The authors proposed sufficient conditions for instability in a probabilistic sense In this paper we focus on the problem of characterizing switching signals that are destabilizing Identification\nof such switching signals are useful for obvious reasons For example, from the viewpoint of resilience of a system,\nit is often necessary to know which switching signals do not preserve good qualitative behaviour of the system so\nthat adequate measures for preventing them may be taken We will study the following problem: given a family of continuous-time linear systems containing both asymptotically stable and unstable subsystems, and a set of admissible transitions, characterize a class of switching\nsignals under which the resulting switched system is unstable Since we allow the presence of unstable subsystems,\nconstant switching signals on these subsystems are destabilizing, and constitute a trivial solution to our problem However, our objective is to characterize a (possibly large) class of switching signals beyond the class of constant\nsignals on unstable subsystems 1 2 Our contributions",
    "Our contributions Multiple Lyapunov-like functions are a widely used tool for studying stability of switched\nsystems [11, Chapter 3] The underlying idea is that the maximum increase in these functions caused by activation\nof unstable subsystems and occurrence of switches is compensated by the minimum decrease caused by activation\nof asymptotically stable subsystems We will utilize minimum increase and maximum decrease of these functions\nto characterize instability of a switched system Our characterization of destabilizing switching signals involves\nasymptotic behaviour of the following properties of these signals: frequency of switching, frequency of transition\nbetween subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems It does not involve nor imply conditions on a\nswitching signal on every interval of time Earlier in [9] asymptotic properties of switching signals were used to characterize stability of a switched system Our class of destabilizing switching signals is a strict subset of the class of switching signals that does not obey\nthe stability condition proposed in [9, Theorem 5] (De)stabilizing properties of the class of switching signals\nthat satisfies neither the stability condition of [9] nor the instability condition proposed in this paper, remains\nundetermined To summarize, our contributions in this paper are the following:\n\n\n◦ Given a family of systems containing both asymptotically stable and unstable subsystems, and a set of admissible\ntransitions, we characterize a class of switching signals under which the resulting switched system is unstable Our characterization of instability is based solely on the asymptotic properties of a switching signal ◦ We study relations between asymptotic characterization of stabilizing and destabilizing switching signals for\nswitched systems To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance in the literature when multiple Lyapunov-like functions\nare employed to characterize instability of a switched system, and the gap between asymptotic characterization of\nstabilizing and destabilizing switching signals, is addressed The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in §2 we formulate the problem under consideration, and\ncatalog required definitions and notations We also recall the stability condition from [9] in this section Our main\nresults appear in §3 We elaborate on our results with discussions and numerical examples We conclude in §4\nwith a brief discussion of future research directions Proofs for the auxiliary and main results are presented in a\nconsolidated fashion in §5 and §6, respectively",

    "]\n\n\n4 Concluding remarks\n\n\nIn this paper we proposed a class of destabilizing switching signals for continuous-time switched linear systems Our characterization of instability is based on the asymptotic behaviour of frequency of switching, frequency of\ntransitions between subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems Asymptotic properties of switching\nsignals were employed to characterize stability of a switched linear system earlier in [9] We showed that our class\nof destabilizing switching signals is a strict subset of the class of switching signals that does not satisfy the stability\ncondition of [9], and thereby identified a gap between asymptotic characterization of stabilizing and destabilizing\nswitching signals An interesting future direction is about determining (de)stabilizing properties of the switching\nsignals that satisfy neither the stability condition of [9] nor the instability condition proposed in this paper As\ndiscussed in Remark 8, this problem cannot be addressed with multiple Lyapunov-like functions based analysis in\nits standard form, and additional tools are required As\ndiscussed in Remark 8, this problem cannot be addressed with multiple Lyapunov-like functions based analysis in\nits standard form, and additional tools are required 5 Proofs of Fact 3 and Proposition 1\n\n\nProof of Fact 3 We begin with asymptotically stable subsystems p ∈P S Let `R` [d] ∋ ξ �→ V p (ξ) :=< P p ξ, ξ >,\nwhere P p ∈ `R` [d][×][d] is a symmetric and positive definite solution to the Lyapunov equation\n\n\n(15) A [⊤] p [P] [p] [+][ P] [p] [A] [p] [=][ −][Q] [p]\n\n\nfor some pre-selected symmetric and positive definite matrix Q p ∈ `R` [d][×][d] [1, Corollary 11",
