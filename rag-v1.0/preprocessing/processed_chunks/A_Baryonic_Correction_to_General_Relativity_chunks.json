relativity\n\n\nGeneral relativity was discovered early this century and twenty four years after its\n\n\nintroduction, it was found to predict black holes [15] Relativity has been extrapolated\n\n\nto where stars, galaxies and the whole universe could be compressed into a space smaller\n\n\nthan an atom There is not one shred of evidence that the universe started at Planck\n\n\ndensities ρ = 10 [93] g/cm [3] and temperatures T = 10 [31][o] K No high energy phenomena have\n\n\nbeen found from the first instant of creation The nucleosynthesis of light atomic nuclei\n\n\n4 He, 2 H, and 7 Li took place around densities of 10 5 g/cm 3 and temperatures of ∼ 10 10o K,\n\n\naccording to accepted models [18,25] These conditions are the most extreme that has\n\n\nbeen confirmed in the big bang Thus general relativity, as applied to the universe [21],\n\n\nhas been extrapolated eighty orders of magnitude in density from points at which it has\n\n\nbeen validated Only for a homogeneous, isotropic universe, the field equation has been\n\n\nsimplified to the Friedmann equation\n\n\n\na˙\nH [2] + (K/a [2] ) ≡\n� a\n\n\n\n2\n+ (K/a [2] ) = (8πρG)/3, (1 1)\n�\n\n\n\nwhere H ≡ a/a˙ is the Hubble constant, which is time dependent G is the gravitational\n\n\nconstant, ρ is the mass-energy density, p is the pressure and a(t) is the scale factor of the\n\n\nuniverse, ∼ 10 [28] cm, presently There is always a perfect fluid in the stress-energy tensor\n\n\nT αβ = ρu α u β + p(g αβ + u α u β ), (1 2)\n\n\nwhich ignores viscosity, shearing forces and subatomic effects including differences be\n\ntween individual baryons and bulk baryons, n B ≫ 10 [3] Since it has been validated up to\n\n\nnuclear densities in pulsars, changes in the stress-energy tensor T αβ at higher densities\n\n\nwill be investigated 2\n\n\nII Theoretical changes necessary\n\n\nThe Oppenheimer and Volkoff equations of state [16] are used for neutron density\n\n\nmatter and neutron stars up to 3x10 [14] gm/cm [3],\n\n\ndm\n\n= 4πr [2] ρ\ndr\n\n\ndp\n= −(ρ + p)(m + (4πr [3] p))/r(r − m), (2 1)\ndr\n\n\nwhere m is the mass within a given radius r Since these equations result from the\n\n\nfield equation, information about the density change with pressure is also necessary Neutron stars theoretically have masses up to 5M ⊙ Single neutrons have a compression\n\n\nenergy about 300 MeV [6] Nuclear colliders start producing quark-gluon plasma at\n\n\nenergies over 2x10 [12][o] K ≈ 184MeV After all the space in the neutron is eliminated\n\n\nρ > 10 [17] gm/cm [3], the net quantum effect of further collapse and core compression must\n\n\nbe a reversible energy sink Since nuclear pressures can’t halt a gravitational collapse,\n\n\nsufficient energy loss at supranuclear densities must result in a stable configuration prior\n\n\nto quark formation An inhomogeneous collapse must stop when the compression energy\n\n\nlosses of core neutrons at peak ρ ∼ 10 [18] − 10 [19] g/cm [3] exactly match the gravitational\n\n\nenergy, as shown in figure 1 III Resulting changes in our understanding\n\n\nPrior to the big bang, core densities slowly increased and the energy sink of compressive\n\n\nlosses rapidly overtook the collapse energy by an overall mass-density ρ ∼ 10 [16] gm/cm [3] If all the matter in the universe was in a spherical mass to start, its radius was ∼ 10 [13] cm 3\n\n\nAs the density rose in the core, the field disappeared and the pressure p = ρ/3 → 0\n\n\nin the stress-energy tensor as well By including this energy loss, energy-momentum\n\n\nis conserved With T and the vacuum energy λ ≈ 0, an open universe existed during\n\n\nt ≤ 0 No singularities ever existed since there were no infinities in energy, density or time Accretion and other photons from previous universes were very red shifted by release into\n\n\nvolumes ≫ today, so that they played no role during the open universe period Neutron\n\n\ncompression energy supplied ≈ 160MeV ≈ 1 85x10 [12][o] K which propelled the farthest\n\n\ngalaxies ∼ 0 5c After the bounce, the metric changed to flat There was no difference\n\n\nwhether the early universe was closed or open [13] The extrinsic curvature (6˙a [2] )/a [2]\n\n\nwas much more important than the intrinsic curvature ±6/a [2] within any hyperspace of\n\n\nhomogeneity, since ˙a [2] was very large initially The zones of influence were too small to\n\n\nrespond differently to negative or positive spacetime curvatures The standard hot universe problems [12], can be summarized and solved with the\n\n\nabove correction The singularity problem follows from the scale factor of the universe\n\n\na(t) vanishes as t → 0 and the energy density becomes infinitely large The inhomogeneity\n\n\nof matter with the energy sink and red shifting of radiation prior to the big bang caused\n\n\nthe total energy-density → 0 The flatness problem can be stated in several ways The ratio of the universe’s mean\n\n\nmass density to the cold Einstein-de Sitter universe\n\n\nρ/ρ c = 3H [2] /8πρG (3 1)\n\n\nThe Friedmann-Robertson-Walker(FRW) equation implies that this ratio, which was\n\n\nproportional to curvature, was 1 ± 10 [−][60] at the Planck era The ’kinetic energy’ (˙a/a) [2]\n\n\nwas equal to the gravitational mass-energy 8πρG/3, so that k ≈ 0 in equation (1 1) Only a bounce mechanism by which the gravitational mass-energy was converted into\n\n\nkinetic energy could allow the universe to be so flat The unchanged nuclear state of the\n\n\n4\n\n\ncore allows this to happen without producing quarks ∼ 160 MeV was sufficient to break\n\n\nthe shell into billions of cold baryonic masses ≤ 10 [16] M ⊙ For mass M the gravitational\n\n\nradius R g = GM/c [2] then\n\n\nρ = c [6] /G [3] M [2], (3 2)\n\n\nat black hole formation Thus primordial holes could only be formed from the expanding\n\n\nshell neutrons in masses ≥ 4M ⊙ if ρ max ≈ 3x10 [16] g/cm [3] If this density can not be\n\n\nexceeded, then smaller black holes < 1M ⊙ could not be formed, which would explain the\n\n\nmissing Hawking radiation [8] The horizon problem has to do with areas in the initial instant of creation that are\n\n\ntoo far from each other to have been influenced by initial disturbances A light pulse\n\n\nbeginning at t=0 will have travelled by time t, a physical distance\n\n\nt\nl(t) = a(t) (3 3)\n� 0 [dt] [′] [a] [−][1] [(][t] [′] [) = 2][t,]\n\n\nand this gives the physical horizon distance or Hubble radius dH In a matter dominated\n\n\nuniverse without vacuum energy λ = 0,\n\n\ndH ≈ 2H 0 [−][1] [Ω] 0 [−][1][/][2] (1 + z) [−][3][/][2], (3 4)\n\n\nwhere Ω 0 = ρ/ρ c in the present universe This distance is compared with the radius L(t)\n\n\nof the region at time t which evolves into our currently observed area of the universe\n\n\n≈ 10 [10] years Using a quark model near Planck conditions, this ratio l [3] /L [3] is going to\n\n\nbe very small, about 10 [−][83] Since the average baryonic density initially is ∼ 10 [16] g/cm [3]\n\n\nrather than Planck densities of 10 [93] g/cm [3], the horizon problem is diminished by a factor\n\n\nof ∼ 10 [77] Either the continuing loss of shell mass during T αβ ≈ 0 or a major distur\n\nbance near equilibrium, will allow a nearly simultaneous release of the stored neutron\n\n\ncompression energy Since state data on bulk nucleons is lacking, a reduction equation\n\n\n5\n\n\nfor a static system is extrapolated for compression losses of E sink = exp(ρ/2x10 [14] ) in the\n\n\nenergy term T ˆoˆo The homogeneity and isotropy problems arise due to the postulated start of the\n\n\nuniverse in such a state The distribution of galaxies and clusters are not random on large\n\n\nscales A compilation of 869 clusters has shown a quasi-regular pattern with high density\n\n\nregions separated by voids at intervals ≈ 120Mpc [4]",
    "[4] The CMBR has dipole anisotropy\n\n\nnot due to our Local Group motion [11] The universe is not isotropic on its largest scales It has long been assumed that galaxy formation, which started after the decoupling of\n\n\nmatter and energy, grew by gravitational amplification of small density fluctuations With the Hubble space telescope, there is evidence that galaxies were assembled z > 4\n\n\n[14] Primordial galaxies, composed of hot [1] H − [4] He clouds orbiting the black hole\n\n\nremnants of the cold shell, were already present prior to decoupling of matter and energy\n\n\nz ≈ 1100 As the universe expanded and the shell remnants separated, hydrogen was\n\n\nefficiently removed from intergalactic space down to the Gunn-Peterson [1] H limit, and\n\n\nattenuated the CMBR temperature gradients as follows Hot electrons upscattered the\n\n\nredshifted photons emitted by orbiting hydrogen deeper in the protogalactic wells With\n\n\ndecoupling, there are three types of scattering which accomplished this [17] Thompson\n\n\nscattering by itself can not help thermalization because there is no energy exchange\n\n\nbetween the photons and electrons If\n\n\nσ T = 8π/3(e [2] /m) [2], (3 5)\n\n\nis the Thompson scattering cross section, then the mean-free-path for a photon between\n\n\ncollisions is\n\n\nλ γ = (σ T n e ) [−][1], (3 6)\n\n\nwhere n e is the number density of electrons While traveling a distance l, the photon\n\n\nwill perform a random walk and undergo N collisions where N [1][/][2] λ γ = l Since Compton\n\n\n6\n\n\nscattering will not change the number of photons, it will not create a Planck spectrum Free-free absorption at a frequency ω, is given by [17] t ff [∼] = 3(6πmT ) [1][/][2] mω [3] /(32e [6] n [2] e [π] [3] [)][/][(1][ −] [e] [−][ω/T] [ )][ ] (3 7)\n\n\nFor photons with a frequency ω ≈ T in electron volts,\n\n\nt ff = 2x10 [14] sec(Ω B h [2] x e ) [−][2] T [−][5][/][2] (3 8)\n\n\nFor ionization fraction x e ≈ 1,\n\n\nt ff /H [−][1] ≈ (T/1 9x10 [4] eV ) [−][1][/][2] (Ω B h [2] ) [−][2] (3 9)\n\n\nThompson scattering increases the effective path length for photon absorption of free-free\n\n\nscattering\n\n\nt¯ = 1 1x10 [11] sec T [−][11][/][4] (Ω B h [2] X e ) [−][3][/][2] (3 10)\n\n\nWith primordial galaxies, free-free can dominate over Compton scattering between 90eV\n\n1eV, lead to true thermalization and diminish temperature gradients in the CMBR In\n\n\nFRW geometry, radiation energy ρ R ∝ a [−][4] and T ∝ a [−][1] An increase in a(t) from\n\n\n10 [13] cm to 10 [28] cm today would cause the corresponding temperature of CMBR would\n\n\nbe 00185 [o] K, without the accretion energy released from the previous universe Big\n\n\nbang photons are thus the small tail of the thermal spectrum near absolute zero See\n\n\nfor example [27] which discusses reasons for this tail The smooth Planck spectrum at\n\n\n2 73 [o] K with δT/T ∼ 10 [−][5] was released by accretion during the collapse of the previous\n\n\nuniverse at a(t) ∼ 10 [22] cm , as shown in figure 2 The photon number density cm [−][3]\n\n\nn γ = 2 038x10 [28] T 9 [3] [,] (3 11)\n\n\nwhere T 9 is the temperature in units of 10 [9][o] K Therefore the photon density of the big\n\n\nbang is 1",
    "Therefore the photon density of the big\n\n\nbang is 1 29x10 [−][7] rather than 422 This changes the baryon/photon ratio to\n\n\nη = 87 6Ω B h [2], (3 12)\n\n\n7\n\n\nwhere h is the Hubble constant in units of 100km sec [−][1] Mpc [−][1] The explosion mechanism\n\n\nand η are similar to that of a supernova The hot baryon to photon ratio must be\n\n\nmultiplied by the cold baryon factor CBF plus one to obtain the total baryon/photon\n\n\nratio\n\n\nη hot (CBF + 1) = η total (3 13)\n\n\nA total η ≥ 100 will definitely close the universe with baryons With the kind assistance\n\n\nof Edward W With the kind assistance\n\n\nof Edward W (Rocky)Kolb, the nucleosynthesis program NUC123 of Larry Kawano was\n\n\nmodified Cold baryons were calculated by multiplying the hot baryon density thm(9)\n\n\nin subroutine therm by the cold baryon multiplier This was added to the total energy\n\n\ndensity thm(10) and thus to the Hubble constant The program was compiled using\n\n\nthe fortran77 compiler of the Absoft Corporation with the Vax compatibility option A\n\n\ndouble precision option for all floating point variables and disabling of overflow checking\n\n\nallowed calculations with hot η > 1 Using cold baryons, neutrino degeneration and\n\n\nη as variables,it was found that η = 10 [−][7], a cold baryon multiplier 10 [9] and an electron\n\n\nneutrino chemical potential ξ ν e = 1 8 gave a D or [2] H/H = 1 9x10 [−][4] and a [4] He/H = 246 Using cold baryons allowed yields of [2] H/H > 10 [−][4] The deuterium fraction increased\n\n\nwith increasing cold baryons The [4] He yields decreased with increasing electron neutrino\n\n\nchemical potential by reducing the neutron to proton ratio at freeze out, as first noted\n\n\n[25] Doubling the cold baryons gave a [2] H/H = 2 07x10 [−][4] without change to other\n\n\nyields The other yields were\n\n\n3 3 −5 7 −10\nH = 5 35x10 [−][7] He = 1 4x10 Li = 1 4x10\n\n\nN = 6 8x10 [−][8] 6 Li = 4 2x10 −14 7 Be = 4 1x10−11\n\n\n8\nLi + up = 1 7x10 [−][15], (3 14)\n\n\nThese are all compatable with the standard nucleosynthesis yields except the nitrogen\n\n\nfraction which has N = 5 6x10 [−][16] The low estimate deuterium fraction now in favor\n\n\n8\n\n\n(1 − 2)x10 [−][5], could be made with the same neutrino degeneration, η = 10 [−][6] and cold\n\n\nbaryon factor of 10 [9] as well as η = 10 [−][7] and a cold baryon factor of 2x10 [8] The last case\n\n\nprobably hasn’t sufficient baryons to close the universe Galaxy formation problems [19] are greatly simplified An explosive universe with\n\n\ngalaxy formation will fit the large scale galactic pattern [26] Although the Jeans mass\n\n\nis thought to be the point at which gravity overcomes pressure to form galaxies, massive\n\n\nrotating primordial black holes may be necessary for galactic structure In the Tully\n\nFisher relation\n\n\nV c = 220(L/L ⋆ ) [ ][22], (3 15)\n\n\nand Faber-Jackson\n\n\nV c = 220(L/L ⋆ ) [ ][25], (3 16)\n\n\nwhere V c is the circular velocity km/sec and L ⋆ is the characteristic galaxy luminosity The former relation is for velocities in the dark halo of spiral galaxies and the latter for\n\n\nstar velocity dispersion in central parts of elliptical galaxies [20] Rotational energy is\n\n\na function of MV c [2] [ Galactic brightness results from] [ 1] [H][ mass,][ M] [galaxy] [ The black hole]\n\n\ncapturing cross

bang Thus Tully-Fisher can relate the stellar galactic mass and\n\n\nluminosity to the depth of the dark matter potential well and asymtotic circular speed Due to the capture mechanism of [1] H, the black hole nuclear mass M nucleus ∝ M galaxy 9\n\n\nGalaxy formation never involved collapse dynamics with its different post collapse den\n\nsities, circular speeds and disk assymetries The quantization of galactic redshifts found in even multiples of 37km /sec by W G Tifft [22,23,24] and other workers [2,1,9] and also [3,7] is persuasive evidence that the\n\n\ncold baryonic shell, which formed galactic nuclei and quasars, was present already at the\n\n\nbig bang Its different layers received different energies from the hot expanding core, even\n\n\nproducing supermassive black holes Near Abell 3627 there is a mass 5x10 [16] M ⊙, the\n\n\nGreat Attractor [10], which must result from a large initial homogeneity It may be near\n\n\nthe original site of the big bang The explosion mechanism described here is apparently\n\n\nthat in the Hebrew Bible The baryon asymmetry problem has been stated as to why there are many more\n\n\nbaryons than antibaryons Baryon-antibaryon pairs are only created from a vacuum at\n\n\nenergies > 10 [13][o] K, which is higher than the 160MeV ≈ 1 85x10 [12][o] K core temperature Extreme energy phenomena such as domain walls, monopoles, gravitinos and symmetry\n\n\nbreaking were not reached in big bang",
    "Extreme energy phenomena such as domain walls, monopoles, gravitinos and symmetry\n\n\nbreaking were not reached in big bang IV A cyclical universe\n\n\nAlthough equation 1 is cyclical, it is valid only for a universe that is isotropic and\n\n\nhomogeneous i e a perfect fluid In figure 2, the maximum scale factor a max of the\n\n\nuniverse is equal to the gravitational radius\n\n\nR g = GM/c [2] ∼ 10 [29] cm (4 1)\n\n\nAfter a max was reached, the galaxies were blue shifted as they reconverged When a(t)\n\n\nwas 10 [6] smaller than today, the proportionately higher CMBR tore neutrons and protons\n\n\n10\n\n\nfrom nuclei In the center was a growing black hole resulting from merging galactic\n\n\nnuclei Stars and galaxies were accreted onto this supermassive black hole in a massive\n\n\nthick disk Once the mass of this black hole exceeded the size of an average galactic\n\n\nnucleus ∼ 10 [8] M ⊙, tidal forces were no longer capable of tearing a star apart before it\n\n\nentered R g with relatively little radiative losses [5] The collapsing scale factor a(t) forced\n\n\nall the matter and released energy inside the growing R g in a Schwarzschild gometry Then R g → 0 as the spacetime propogation of the core energy losses slowly reduced the\n\n\npotential barrier of the supermassive black hole V V DISCUSSION\n\n\nAlthough classical general relativity has been confirmed to one part in 10 [12], it must\n\n\nbreak down prior to the infinite densities of singularities There is no reason why a small\n\n\nmass > 4M ⊙ can contract to a singularity while the mass of universe explodes into the\n\n\nbig bang If a star surface lies entirely inside the R g, classical relativity concludes from\n\n\nKruskal-Szekeres diagrams that it must collapse to a singularity or faster than the speed\n\n\nof light Here coordinate reversal occurs, ∂/∂r is timelike (g rr < 0) and proper time at\n\n\nthe surface\n\n\nR\nτ = − [g rr ] [1][/][2] dr + constant",
