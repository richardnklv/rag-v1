weights are used to\nmodel antagonistic interactions resulting in Laplacian matrix\nwith absolute diagonal elements, and in [10], the author has\nextended the model of [9] to the one that allows arbitrary timedependent interactions In [11], they have further considered\ntime-varying signed graphs under the setup of the antagonistic\ninteractions On the other hand, opinion dynamics with state\nconstraints was also examined when the agents are preferred\nto attach to the initial opinion, i e , with stubborn agents [13] Recently, in [14], they have examined a joint impact of the\ndynamical properties of individual agents and the interaction\ntopology among them on polarizability, consensusability, and\nneutralizability, with a further extension to heterogeneous\nsystems with non-identical dynamics Unlike the scalar-consensus based updates, there also have\nbeen some works on opinion dynamics with matrix weighed\ninteractions Recently, opinion dynamics with multidimensional or multiple interdependent topics have been reported in\n\n[15], [16] In [15], multidimensional opinion dynamics based\non Friedkin and Johnsen (FJ) model and DeGroot models were\nanalyzed in the discrete-time domain The continuous-time\nversion of [15] with stubborn agents was presented and analyzed in [16] The DeGroot-Friedkin model was also analyzed\nto conclude that it has an exponential convergent equilibrium\npoint [17] Also in [17], they considered the dynamic network\ntopology to evaluate the propagation property of the social\npower Since the topics are interdependent and coupled with\neach other, these works may be classified as matrix-weighted\nconsensus problems [18] Opinion dynamics under leader\nagents with matrix weighted couplings was studied in [19] In this paper, we would like to present a new model for\nopinion dynamics on multiple interdependent topics under a\nstate-dependent matrix weighted consensus setup We first\nprovide a model for characterizing the coupling effects of\nmultiple interdependent topics We consider both the proportional and inverse proportional feedback effects on diagonal\nand off-diagonal terms The cooperative dynamics and noncooperative dynamics are modeled using the signs of diffusive\ncouplings of each topic Then, we provide some analysis on\nthe convergence or consensus of the topics Two results will\nbe presented according to the property of weighting matrices The first result is developed when the coupling matrices are\npositive semidefinite When the coupling matrices are positive\nsemidefinite, exact conditions for complete opinion consensus\nand cluster consensus are provided Then, as the second\nresult, when the coupling matrices are indefinite, we provide\na sufficient condition for a complete opinion consensus Consequently, the main contributions of this paper can be\nsummarized as follows First, a model for opinion dynamics\nis established The connectivities are characterized by interaction topology between agents and coupling topology among\nthe topics Thus, the overall system has two-layer network\ntopologies Second, analysis for complete opinion consensus\nand partial opinion consensus is presented for both the cases\nwhen the coupling matrices are positive semidefinite and\nindefinite As far as the authors are concerned, this is the first\npaper that presents a detailed model for inverse-proportional\nand proportional feedback opinion dynamics along with the\nconvergence analysis This paper is organized as follows Section II provides a detailed process for building models\nfor opinion dynamics Section III presents the analysis for\nconvergence of cooperative opinion dynamics Section IV is\ndedicated to simulation results

although\nthe agents _i_ and _j_ are connected, for example, the topics _p_ and _r_ are not\ncoupled **Definition** **1 ** _Two agents i and j are considered connected_\n_if A_ _[i,j]_ _is not identically zero, i e , A_ _[i,j]_ = 0 _̸_ _ The topology for_\n_overall network connectivities is represented by the interaction_\n_graph G_ = ( _V, E_ ) _where the edge set E characterizes the_\n_connectivities between agents If there is a spanning tree in the_\n_network G, it is called connected For a topic p ∈T, the graph_\n_is called p-coupled if the elements of the set {a_ _[i,j]_ _p,p_ _[,][ ∀]_ [(] _[i, j]_ [)] _[ ∈]_\n_E} are connected for the topic p The topology for the topic_\n_p is defined by the graph G_ _p_ = ( _V_ _p_ _, E_ _p_ ) _, where p ∈T, and_\n_V_ _p_ = _{x_ 1 _,p_ _, x_ 2 _,p_ _, , x_ _n,p_ _} and E_ _p_ = _{_ ( _i, j_ ) : _a_ _[i,j]_ _p,p_ _[̸]_ [= 0] _[}][ ]_\n_If it is p-coupled for all topics p ∈T, it is called all-topic_\n_coupled _\n\n\n**Definition** **2 ** _For the edge_ ( _i, j_ ) _, let the topology for the_\n_couplings among topics be denoted as G_ _i,j_ = ( _V_ _i,j_ _, E_ _i,j_ ) _,_\n_which is called coupling graph for the edge_ ( _i, j_ ) _, where V_ _i,j_\n_includes all the topics contained in the agents i and j, and_\n_E_ _i,j_ _includes all the couplings If G_ _i_ 1 _,j_ 1 = _G_ _i_ 2 _,j_ 2 _for all edges_\n( _i_ 1 _, j_ 1 ) _̸_ = ( _i_ 2 _, j_ 2 ) _, then all the coupling topologies of the_\n_society are equivalent If all the coupling topologies between_\n_agents are equivalent, it is called homogeneous-coupling net-_\n_work Otherwise, it is called heterogeneous-coupling network _\n\n\nBased on the above definitions, we can see that every _G_ _p_ is\ndisconnected even though _G_ is connected If the union of all\n_G_ _p_ is connected, then _G_ is also connected Also, since each\nagent has the same set of topics, _V_ _i,j_ = _T_ for all ( _i, j_ ) _∈E_ **Assumption 1 ** _The coupling between neighboring agents is_\n_symmetric, i e , if there exists a coupling_ ( _p, q_ ) _in E_ _i,j_ _, there_\n_also exists a coupling_ ( _q, p_ ) _in E_ _i,j_ _ _\n\n\n**Example 1 ** _Fig 1 shows the concepts of “connected” and_\n_“coupled” in neighboring agents The coupling graph G_ _i,j_ _can_\n_be determined as G_ _i,j_ = ( _V_ _i,j_ _, E_ _i,j_ ) _where V_ _i,j_ = _{p, q, r} and_\n_E_ _i,j_ = _{_ ( _p, q_ ) _,_ ( _q, r_ ) _,_ ( _q, p_ ) _,_ ( _r, q_ ) _} _\n\n\nEach agent updates its coefficients in the matrix _A_ _[i,j]_ in\nthe direction of cooperation or in the direction of antagonism For a cooperative update, the rules for opinion update are\nformulated as:\n\n\n_•_ The diagonal terms: If _a_ _[i,j]_ _k,k_ [is positive and as it increases,]\nthe tendency of agreement between _x_ _j,k_ and _x_ _i,k_ increases Otherwise, if _a_ _[i,j]_ _k,k_ [is negative and as it increases]\nto bigger negative value, the tendency of anti-agreement\nbetween _x_ _j,k_ and _x_ _i,k_ becomes significant _̸_\n\n_[̸]_\n\n\n≜ _x_ ˙ _i_ =\n\n\n\n_̸_\n\n_[̸]_\n\n\n_n_\n� _A_ _[i,j]_ ( _x_ _j_ _−_ _x_ _i_ ) (1)\n\n_j∈N_ _i_\n\n\n\n_̸_\n\n_[̸]_\n\n\nwhere _A_ _[i,j]_ _∈_ R _[d][×][d]_ is the matrix weighting for the edge\n( _i, j_ ) _∈E_ and _i ∈V_, and _|E|_ = _m_ and _|V|_ = _n_ The practical\nmeaning of (1) is that each member of a society may have\nits own opinion about the topics, and the opinions are intercoupled with the opinions of the neighboring agents Thus,\nthe matrix _A_ _[i,j]_ characterizes the logical reasoning of agent _i_\nwith opinions from agent _j_ The neighborhoods of agents are\ndetermined by the interaction graph _G_ = ( _V, E_ ) If a topic in\nmember _i_ has at least one connection to another topic or the\nsame topic of another agent _j_, then two agents _i_ and _j_ are\ncalled _connected_ The terminology _connection_ or _connected_ is\nused for defining the connection in the level of agents When\nthere are connections between the topics, it is called _coupled_\nor _couplings_ between topics Thus, the terminology _coupled_ or\n_couplings_ is used in the level of topics Therefore, based on\nthe terminological definitions, if there is at least one coupling\nbetween the topics of agents _i_ and _j_, then two agents _i_ and\n_j_ can be considered as connected However, even though two\nagents are connected, it does not mean that a topic in an agent\nis connected to another topic of the other agent The formal\ndefinitions are given as follows _•_ The off-diagonal terms: Let us consider the effect of _a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1 [ ]\nWe can consider the following four cases:\n\n\n1) Case 1: ( _x_ _j,_ 2 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 2 ) _≥_ 0 and ( _x_ _j,_ 1 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 1 ) _≥_ 0\n2) Case 2: ( _x_ _j,_ 2 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 2 ) _≥_ 0 and ( _x_ _j,_ 1 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 1 ) _<_ 0\n3) Case 3: ( _x_ _j,_ 2 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 2 ) _<_ 0 and ( _x_ _j,_ 1 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 1 ) _≥_ 0\n4) Case 4: ( _x_ _j,_ 2 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 2 ) _<_ 0 and ( _x_ _j,_ 1 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 1 ) _<_ 0\n\nWhen ( _x_ _j,_ 2 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 2 ) _≥_ 0, agent _i_ needs to increase the\nvalue of _x_ _i,_ 2 to reach a consensus to _x_ _j,_ 2 Otherwise, if\n( _x_ _j,_ 2 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 2 ) _<_ 0, agent _i_ needs to decrease the value\nof _x_ _i,_ 2 to reach a consensus to _x_ _j,_ 2 So, for the cases\n1 and 2, to enhance the agreement tendency, it needs to\nincrease the value of _x_ _i,_ 2, by way of multiplying _a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1\nand ( _x_ _j,_ 1 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 1 ) Thus, when ( _x_ _j,_ 1 _−_ _x_ _i,_ 1 ) _≥_ 0, we can\nselect _a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1 _[>]_ [ 0][; but when][ (] _[x]_ _[j,]_ [1] _[−][x]_ _[i,]_ [1] [)] _[ <]_ [ 0][, we can select]\n_a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1 _[<]_ [ 0][ On the other hand, in the case of][ (] _[x]_ _[j,]_ [2] _[−][x]_ _[i,]_ [2] [)] _[ <]_\n0, we can select _a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1 _[<]_ [ 0][ when][ (] _[x]_ _[j,]_ [1] _[ −]_ _[x]_ _[i,]_ [1] [)] _[ ≥]_ [0][, or we]\ncan select _a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1 _[>]_ [ 0][ when][ (] _[x]_ _[j,]_ [1] _[ −]_ _[x]_ _[i,]_ [1] [)] _[ <]_ [ 0][ For the anti-]\nconsensus update, _a_ _[i,j]_ 2 _,_ 1 [should be selected with opposite]\nsigns The effects of diagonal terms can be modeled as follows:\n\n\n**Definition 3 ** _Direct coupling effects in diagonal terms:_\n\n\n_•_ _Proportional feedbacks: A close opinion between two_\n_agents acts as for increasing the consensus tendency_\n_between them _\n\n\n_•_ _Inverse proportional feedbacks: A quite different opinion_\n_between two agents acts as for increasing the consensus_\n_tendency between them _\n\n\nThe off-diagonal terms need to be designed carefully taking\naccount of the coupling effects in different topics **Definition 4 ** _Cross coupling effects in off-diagonal terms:_\n\n\n_•_ _Proportional feedbacks: A close opinion in one topic acts_\n_as for increasing the consensus tendency of other topics _\n\n_•_ _Inverse proportional feedbacks: A quite different opinion_\n_in one topic acts as for increasing the consensus tendency_\n_of other topics _\n\n\n**Definition 5 ** _(Completely and partial opinion consensus, and_\n_clusters) If a consensus is achieved for all topics, i e , x_ _j,p_ =\n_x_ _i,p_ _for all p ∈T, it is called a complete opinion consensus In_\n_this case, there exists only one cluster Otherwise, if a part of_\n_topics is agreed, it is called partial opinion consensus When_\n_only a partial opinion consensus is achieved, there could exist_\n_clusters_ C _k_ _, k_ = 1 _, , q such that_ C _i_ _∩_ C _j_ = _∅_ _for different i_\n_and j, and_ [�] _[q]_ _k_ =1 [C] _[k]_ [ =] _[ {][x]_ [1] _[, x]_ [2] _[, , x]_ _[n]_ _[}][, and in each cluster,]_\n_x_ _i_ = _x_ _j_ _when x_ _i_ _and x_ _j_ _are elements of the same cluster, i e ,_\n_x_ _i_ _, x_ _j_ _∈_ C _k_ _ _\n\n\n**Definition 6 ** _(Complete clustered consensus) If the opinions_\n_of agents are completely divided without ensuring any par-_\n_tial opinion consensus between them, it is called completely_\n_clustered consensus _\n\n\nIn the case of a partial opinion consensus as per _Definition 5_,\nthe clusters are not completely divided clusters, i e , in two\ndifferent clusters, some topics may reach a consensus Topic 1\n\n\nTopic 2\n\n\nTopic 3\n\n|C1|Col2|C2|Col4|C3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Agent 1||Agent 2<br>Agent 3||Agent 4<br>Agent 5|\n|Agent 1|||||\n\n\n\nFig 2 Partial opinion consensus and clusters The topic 3 reaches a\nconsensus, while topics 1 and 2 do not reach a consensus **Example 2 ** _In Fig 2, there are five agents, with three topics _\n_The agents reach a consensus on the topic p_ = 3 _ But, on_\n_other topics p_ = 1 _,_ 2 _, they do not reach a consensus For_\n_the topic_ 1 _, there are two clusters (i e , agents_ 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 _in one_\n_cluster, and agents_ 4 _,_ 5 _in another cluster), and for the topic_\n2 _, there are also two clusters (i e , agents_ 1 _in one cluster, and_\n_agents_ 2 _,_ 3 _,_ 4 _,_ 5 _in another cluster) So, overall, the network_\n_has a consensus in a part of topics, but they do not reach_\n_a consensus on the other topics So, no complete opinion_\n_consensus is achieved, and no complete clustered consensus is_\n_achieved Consequently, there are three clusters as_ C 1 = _{x_ 1 _},_\nC 2 = _{x_ 2 _, x_ 3 _}, and_ C 3 = _{x_ 4 _, x_ 5 _} _\n\n\nThe consensus and coupling effects given in the _Definition 3_\nand _Definition 4_ can be mathematically modeled as follows _1) Inverse-proportional feedbacks:_ When the values of\nopinions of two agents are quite different, the coupling effects\nare more significant, which may be against from a natural\nphenomenon (ex, gravitational force) That is, when two\nopinions are close, there could be more attraction force In\ninverse-proportional feedbacks, there will be more coupling\neffects when the values of opinions are quite different _•_ Direct coupling in diagonal terms:\n\n\n_a_ _[i,j]_ _p,p_ [=] _[ k]_ _p,p_ _[i,j]_ (2)\n\nwhere _k_ _p,p_ _[i,j]_ [=] _[ k]_ _p,p_ _[j,i]_ _[>]_ [ 0][ ]\n\n_•_ Cross coupling

_i,p_ ) = _−_ 1 when\n_x_ _j,p_ _−_ _x_ _i,p_ _<_ 0 _2) Proportional feedbacks:_ In proportional feedbacks, there\nwill be less coupling effects when the values of opinions are\nquite different _•_

_[i,j]_\n\nand _A_ _[i,j]_ = _A_ _[j,i]_ Thus, with the model (5), the Laplacian\nmatrix is of symmetric Note that in the above coupling models, if ( _p, q_ ) _∈E_ _i,j_, then\n_a_ _[i,j]_ _p,q_ _[̸]_ [= 0][, otherwise,] _[ a]_ _[i,j]_ _p,q_ [= 0][ So, the matrix] _[ A]_ _[i,j]_ [ = [] _[a]_ _[i,j]_ _p,q_ []][ is]\nthe weighting matrix for the topics between two agents _i_ and\n_j_ But, the matrix _A_ _[i,j]_ is state- and sign-dependent, while the\nmatrix _K_ _[i,j]_ = [ _k_ _p,q_ _[i,j]_ []][ is a matrix which defines the topological]\ncharacteristics between topics of the neighboring agents The\nmatrix _K_ _[i,j]_ is called coupling matrix, and it is a constant\nmatrix It is remarkable that the matrix _A_ _[i,j]_ is not an adjacency\nmatrix, and neither is the matrix _K_ _[i,j]_ But, they are similar to\nan adjacency matrix For example, if there is no direct coupling\nbetween the same topics, then _K_ _[i,j]_ is the adjacency matrix\nfor characterizing the couplings between the topics of two\nneighboring agents On the other hand, if all the topics are\ncoupled (i e , a topic of agent _i_ is coupled to all the topics of\nneighboring agent _j_ ), then _K_ _[i,j]_ _−_ I _d_ is the adjacency matrix\nignoring the self-loops The direct coupling in the _p_ -th topic\nimplies that there is a self-loop in the _p_ -th topic node **Example 3 ** _Let us consider the following
