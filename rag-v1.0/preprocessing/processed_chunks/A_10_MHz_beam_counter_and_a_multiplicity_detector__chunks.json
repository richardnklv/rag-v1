    "###### A 10 MHz Beam Counter and a Multiplicity Detector for the E864 Spectrometer\n\nP Haridas [a], I A Pless [a], G Van Buren [a], J Tomasi [a],M S Z Rabin [b],\nK Barish [c], R D Majka [c]\n\n\na Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA b University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA c Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520 USA Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520 USA Abstract\n\n\nThe E864 experiment at BNL requires a beam counter and multiplicity\ndetector system that can perform at an incident beam rate of 10 [7] Au ions\nper second We have developed and tested a 150 µm thick quartz Cherenkov\nbeam counter and a scintillator based multiplicity-trigger counter during the\nfirst run of this experiment in 1994 We obtained a time resolution of 78 ps\nfor the beam counter at an incident beam rate 5×10 [5] Hz and 100 ps at a rate\nof 1×10 [7] Hz Pulse height discrimination is used to obtain a minimum bias\nand a 10% centrality trigger from the multiplicity detectors The multiplicity\ncounter has a time resolution of 250 ps ###### 1 ###### 1 Introduction\n\n\nWe report on a beam and multiplicity-trigger counter system that we have\ndeveloped and tested for the E864 spectrometer at the Brookhaven National\nLaboratory (BNL) E864 is designed to search for rare composite states, stranglets and other novel forms of matter which may be produced in a small fraction\nof relativistic Au-Pb collisions at the BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron\n(AGS) The momentum of the Au beam at the AGS is 11 7 A GeV/c The\nbeam, veto and multiplicity counters constitute the front end of the E864 spectrometer This spectrometer provides momentum, time of flight and energy\n(calorimetry) information for charged and neutral secondary particles produced\nin central ( small impact parameter ) Au-Pb interactions In order to realize a\nsensitivity of 10 [−][11] per interaction for the detection of rare particles within a\n\n\nreasonable running period, it is required that the incident beam intensity be of\nthe order of 10 [7] s [−][1] Stable long term performance and good time resolution\n(80 - 100 ps) at these high rates were the central criteria that dictated the\ndesign and development of the beam and trigger counters As is well known, light emission of a solid scintillator rapidly deteriorates\ndue to radiation damage when exposed to heavy-ion beams To minimize radiation damage as well as the number of beam particle interactions in the\ndetector material we have used a thin (150 µm) quartz plate for the beam\ncounter Cherenkov light emitted by a relativistic ion traversing the quartz\nplate emerges through the edges of the plate after a series of total internal reflections Two photomultipliers (PMT) optically coupled to opposite edges of\nthe quartz plate provide the beam counter with superior signal characteristics\nas compared to a scintillator counter of similar construction Although this\ntechnique has been employed in other experiments [1], the reported results are\nat an incident beam intensity of about 10 [6] Hz, which is an order of magnitude\nless than the desired E864 beam intensity of 10 [7] Hz Thus the main effort\nbehind the development of our beam counters has been to achieve good time\nresolution at high rates while maintaining small PMT anode currents to prevent the deterioration of the photomultiplier tubes due to overheating of the\ndynodes In Section 2 we describe the construction and signal characteristics\nof the beam counter and in Section 4 we give results on time resolution and\nstability The E864 experiment uses a multiplicity trigger to select central events, because in relativistic heavy-ion collisions there is a strong correlation between\nparticle multiplicity and centrality The E864 multiplicity detector is an annular piece of fast BC420 scintillator placed around the beam pipe 13 cm downstream of the target The annulus is segmented into four quadrants and each\nquadrant is viewed by a photomultiplier The centrality trigger is obtained by\nimposing a high discriminator threshold on the summed signals from the four\ncounters We discuss the multiplicity counter in detail, in Section 3 Fig 1 shows the entire beam and multiplicity-trigger counter assembly The\nquartz Cherenkov beam counter is housed in a light tight box that is located\non the extreme left side in Fig 1 In order to veto beam particles which are\nmore than 0 5 cm away from the beam axis a quartz-Cherenkov hole counter is\nplaced immediately upstream of the beam counter, within the same light-tight\nenclosure housing the beam counter Another, larger hole veto counter made of\nscintillator is placed downstream of the beam counter to detect and veto those\n\n\nevents in which a beam particle interacted in the beam counter quartz plate This counter also helps to veto events which have a beam particle accompanied\nby a halo of charged particles that originate from interactions in the upstream\nbeam magnets and collimators The target assembly and the multiplicitytrigger counters are shown on the right side in Fig 1 Lead shielding placed\nbetween the target and the scintillator hole counter minimizes the possibility\nof triggering the veto counter by secondary particles backscattered from the\ntarget Lead shielding upstream of the scintillator veto counter protects it\nfrom knock-on electrons ( δ-rays ) produced by the gold beam passing through\nthe upstream apparatus",
    "Lead shielding upstream of the scintillator veto counter protects it\nfrom knock-on electrons ( δ-rays ) produced by the gold beam passing through\nthe upstream apparatus ###### 2 The Quartz Beam and Hole Counter\n\n\n2 1 Detector Assembly\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the quartz Cherenkov hole-veto and beam counters are housed in a light-tight aluminium box with easily removable front and\nback cover plates for quick access The photomultiplier tubes are mounted\nvertically with respect to the beam axis To describe the optical part of the\nassembly in greater detail we provide in Fig 2 a sketch of the two detectors\nfrom side (a) and perspective (b) views, where VC and BC are the hole-veto\nand beam counters, respectively The quartz plates for both counters are\nmounted in PET (Polyester Terephthalate) frames This material was chosen\nso that humidity changes will not affect the dimensional stability of the frame This material was chosen\nso that humidity changes will not affect the dimensional stability of the frame Two 0 Two 0 5 cm thick lucite plates embedded in the PET frame provide the optical\ncoupling between the quartz plates and the front faces of the 2 inch phototubes The top and bottom edges of the beam counter quartz plate and one\nedge of each of the veto counter quartz plates are held in narrow slits on the\nfront face (i The top and bottom edges of the beam counter quartz plate and one\nedge of each of the veto counter quartz plates are held in narrow slits on the\nfront face (i e away from the PMT face) of the lucite coupler Because the beam counter quartz plate (5 cm x 8 8 cm) is only 150 µm\nthick it is mounted in a way that minimizes the stress on the plate and simultaneously ensures excellent optical contact with the front face of the PMT This is done by filling the slits containing the edges of the quartz plate with\nimmersion oil (refractive index =1 515 ) as illustrated in the expanded part\nin Fig 2",
    "2 The immersion oil is held in the slit by the capillary action of the\nliquid between the lucite and quartz plate surfaces No dripping or draining\nof the oil was observed, regardless of the orientation of the frame We chose\nSupersil-1 for the beam counter quartz plate because of its low radiation damage properties [2], and its property of being striation free in all three directions While mounting the plate, sufficient care has to be taken to ensure that no\nair bubbles are trapped in the immersion oil filling the slits The width of the\nslit proved to be an important factor in achieving a bubble free quartz - lucite\ninterface, and a width of 375 µm was used in the final design The hole veto counter uses a 1 mm thick Corning 2940 quartz plate Because they are less fragile than the beam counter plate, these plates were\noptically cemented into the slits in the lucite The hole veto counter consists\nof two ”L-shaped” pieces, which when mounted with a small overlap as shown\nin Fig 2(b), provide a center hole of dimension 1 cm x 1 cm As each quartz\nplate of the quartz hole counter is viewed by only one phototube, the quartz\nplates need not be perpendicular to the beam In fact, tilting the quartz plate\nby 10 degrees maximized the amount of Cherenkov light that reaches each\nphototube 2 2 Photomultiplier Tube Base modifications\n\n\nWe have used Hamamatsu 12-stage photomultiplier tubes R4001 and R2059\nfor the hole and beam counters, respectively These PMTs belong to the\n1828-01 family of 2 inch phototubes with a rise time of 1 4 ns and transit\ntime jitter of 0 6 ns [3] at the recommended operating voltage of 2500 V These photomultiplier tubes were the most economical choice with adequate\nrise time and a sufficiently high anode current limit It is important for high\nrate (10 [7] Hz) operation of PMTs to prevent voltage sag in the last dynodes,\nbecause such voltage sag will cause a degradation of the rise time of the signal It is also important to maintain low PMT anode currents to prevent gain\nlosses due to the overheating of the last dynodes To satisfy both of these\n\n∼\nrequirements we must operate the tubes at a low main voltage ( 1600 V),\nwith high current voltage supplies on the eleventh and twelveth dynodes This\nrequires a modification of the base resistor chain as shown in Fig",
    "This\nrequires a modification of the base resistor chain as shown in Fig 3 In addition\nto the external voltage supplies, we have also connected 4 7 nF capacitators\nto all the dynodes to provide a filter for high freqency noise 2 3 Signal and Pulse Height Distribution\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the pulses from the top and bottom PMTs of the beam\ncounter observed on a 300 MHz analog scope during a ∼1s spill of 11 7 A GeV/c\nAu ions at a beam rate of 1 2 x 10 [7] Hz The pulses have a rise time of about\n2 ns, an average pulse height of about 30mV (50Ωtermination) and FWHM\nof about 4 ns These pulses were obtained after the original signals from\nthe PMTs were split equally into two, and thus represent 50% of the original\n\n\nsignals Comparisons of these pulses with those at lower rates ( 5×10 [5] Hz )\nshow no noticeble changes in the pulse height or pulse width At an incident\nbeam rate of 5 x 10 [5] Hz, we estimate the anode current to be about 4µA At beam rates of 1 x 10 [7] Hz the anode current is about 80µA, well below\nthe 200µA maximum anode current limit set by the manufacturers We also\nnote here, that for AGS beams of 1 x 10 [7] Hz, the ”average continuous anode”\ncurrent for each beam counter photomultiplier is about 20µA, because the\nbeam spills are at 4 sec intervals By maintaining a low pulse height we have\nbeen able to operate these PMTs at sufficiently low anode currents, to ensure\na longer life time for these photomultiplier tubes We have also compared the\npulses at the begining and end of each spill during a high rate run and seen\nno pulse height variations Any observed differences would suggest that the\ndynode voltages at the end of the resistor chain are sagging below their preset\nvoltages, or the presence of a dynode heating effect The pulse height spectrum as measured using a Fastbus ADC (LeCroy\n1881) is shown in Fig",
    "The pulse height spectrum as measured using a Fastbus ADC (LeCroy\n1881) is shown in Fig 5 The least count for this ADC is 0 1 pC The main\npeak of the pulse height spectrum is around ADC channel 850 and represents\nroughly a 40mV pulse that has been amplified 10 times, before being routed to\nthe ADC input This agrees quite well with the pulse height as seen in Fig 4,\nwhere the peak height of the outer envelope of the band is around 40 mV The second smaller peak around 1700 can be identified as those events with\n2 beam particles hitting the counter simultaneously Third and fourth peaks,\ncorresponding to the simultaneous passage of three and four gold ions, respectively, through the quartz plate are present at 2550 and 3400 ADC channels A Gaussian fit to the main peak gives a sigma of 102 channels which represents\na 12% width for the pulse height distribution A Gaussian fit to the main peak gives a sigma of 102 channels which represents\na 12% width for the pulse height distribution 2 4 Radiation Damage of the Quartz Plate\n\n\nAlthough the beam counter was tested at high rates (1×10 [7] Hz) during the\n1994 run, most of the data taking was performed at a beam rate of 5×10 [5] Hz,\nfor a total exposure of 10 [11] Au ions Comparison of pulses taken at the begining and the end of the running period showed very little variation in the\npulse height, thus suggesting little or no radiation damage to the quartz plate However, during the 1995 run a gradual degradation of the pulse height was\nobserved as the quartz plate was exposed to a beam rate of 5×10 [6] Hz for extended periods of data taking The cause of this drop in pulse height was\nidentified to be the acumulation of a thin film of material in and around the\nregion where the beam passed through the quartz plate This surface contam\n\nination of the quartz plate adversely affects the total internal reflection of the\nCherenkov light thus resulting in a loss of pulse height It was found that the\nplate could be thoroughly cleaned using methanol, thus removing this surface\ndeposition Spectroscopic studies showed the surface film to be made of carbon\nand oxygen compounds It should be noted here that all components of the beam counter including\nthe quartz plate was exposed to air During the rest of the 1995 run, Nitrogen\nwas circulated through the beam counter housing in an attempt to prevent the\nsurface contamination of the quartz plate Although this could have reduced\nthe rate of accumulation, close examination of the quartz plate at the end of\nthe run showed a faint spot on the quartz plate For the forthcoming run in\n1996 we are redesigning the quartz plate holder so that it can be operated\nin vaccuum Additional design modifications are also being implemented to\nfacilitate quick changes of the quartz plate, if required, during the run",
    "Additional design modifications are also being implemented to\nfacilitate quick changes of the quartz plate, if required, during the run ###### 3 The Multiplicity Detector\n\n\n3 1 Detector Assembly\n\n\nThe E864 multiplicity detector covers the angular range from 16 6 [◦] to\n45 [◦] (η = pseudo rapidity = 1 92 → 0 88) measured with respect to the beam\naxis It is constructed out of four 1 cm thick scintillation counters that fit\naround the beam pipe as shown in Fig 6 A sectional view along the beam is\nshown in Fig 1 It is located 13 cm downstream of the target and is tipped\nat an angle of 8 [◦] to the vertical Simulation studies have shown that as the\nbeam traverses the target, δ-ray production would result in about 200 MeV\nbeing deposited in the scintillation counter To remove this δ-ray effect we\nhave shielded the entire active surface of the scintillator by a ∼ 6 cm thick\nHeavymet [4] ring, around the beam pipe As shown in Fig 1 the counters\nare mounted on two moving stages that can slide towards or away from the\nbeam pipe Each counter is made of a fast (BC 420) quadrant shaped piece of\nscintillator viewed by a 2 inch Hamamatsu 1828-01 phototube with the same\nPMT base as described in Section 2 Booster voltages to the last two dynodes\ncan be provided for high rate operation Each PMT is equipped with an LED\nand a fiber optic channel so that long term behavior of the phototubes could\nbe monitored in an independent manner The operating voltage of the PMTs\nwas set around 1600 V giving a 300 mV pulse height per counter for high\nmultiplicity events The signal from each PMT was first split into two equal\n\n\nhalf-signals Four half-signals from the four counters were combined using a\nPhillip Scientific 744 Fan-in/Fan-out module to generate a summed signal and\nthis signal was discriminated to generate the three triggers (see next section )\nused for the fall 1994 run 3 2 Trigger Scheme\n\n\nThree different interaction triggers were developed for the E864 experiment A mimimum bias trigger (INT0) required that the sum of the pulses from the\nfour multiplicity counters had a threshold greater than 10 mV A centrality\ntrigger (INT2) was implemented by selecting the events which had summed\nsignals from all four counters greater than 340mV This trigger selected those\nevents in the highest 10% of the multiplicity distribution In addition, an\nintermediate multiplicity trigger (INT1) was obtained by triggering on the\nsummed signals above a 200 mV threshold Count down scalers were used to\nselect some fraction of the minimum bias (INT0) and intermediate multiplicity\nevents (INT1) All central event triggers (INT2) were recorded A plot of the\npulse height distribution of the minimum bias trigger is given in Fig 7 The\nhistogram represented by the dotted lines represents the 10% central events 3 3 Comparison with Monte Carlo Studies\n\n\nBecause of the correlation between particle mulitiplicity and centrality a\ncut in the ADC value of the multiplicity counter translates into a selection\nof the impact parameter To study the correlation between ADC value and\ncentrality a Monte Carlo program was written An event is simulated with\nGEANT [5] by sending a 11 71 GeV per nucleon gold ion through a 10% lead\ntarget This ion produces δ-rays until it interacts at a random depth in the\nlead target This collision is simulated with the HIJET [6] event generator The geometry for the study included the target, vacuum chamber, Heavymet\nshielding, and the scintillator multiplicity counter All of GEANT’s physics\nprocesses were turned on for the simulation The program simulates the number of photoelectrons expected after taking into account the energy deposited\nin the scintillator, the emission spectrum for the scintillator, the geometry of\nthe detector, and the photocathode spectral response of the phototube The\nphotoelecron distribution from the simulated data appeared similar to the observed pulse height spectra from the experiment The results of the Monte Carlo study on the centrality selection of the\nmultiplicity counter can be seen in Fig 8 Fig 8(a) shows the distribution\n\n\nof impact parameters for three different cuts on the energy deposited in the\nmultiplicity counter as obtained from the program Fig 8(b) shows the trigger\nprobability for different impact parameters for different cuts on the energy\ndeposited in the multiplicity counter as obtained from the program The solid\nline represents a cut on the events with the 10% most energy deposited; the\ndashed line represents the 5% most energy deposited; the dotted line represents\nthe 1% most energy deposited Fig 8 demonstrates that the multiplicity counter can be used to roughly\nselect the centrality of an event For example, if we make a cut on events with\nthe 10% highest pulse heights, we are selecting events with impact parameters\ncorresponding to the smallest 10% of the impact parameter distribution that\none would expect from a geometric impact parameter distribution 88% of the\ntime Even higher pulse height cuts result in higher centrality events, although\nwith very high cuts the acceptance for these high centrality events also goes\ndown",
    "Even higher pulse height cuts result in higher centrality events, although\nwith very high cuts the acceptance for these high centrality events also goes\ndown ###### 4 Time Resolution and Stability\n\n\nThe times of arrival of pulses from the counters were digitized with Fastbus\nTDC modules (\nLecroy 1872A) with a least count of 50 ps The pulse heights for the beam\ncounter pulses were 30-40 mV [7] and those signals were discriminated at a\nthreshold level of 10 mV Using the ADC information from each PMT we\nhave slew corrected the TDC data independently for each counter The slew\ncorrected distribution of the time difference of the two counters (t B -t A ), at an\nincident beam rate of 10 [7] Hz is given in Fig 9 9 The σ for this distribution\nas obtained by a Gaussian fit is 200 ps From this value we obtain a single\ncounter resolution of 141 ps, and an overall resolution of the two counter system\nof 100 ps, which is the uncertainity in the start time, t 0 ( = 0 5(t A +t B )) for\nthe E864 experiment At the lower beam rate of 5×10 [5] Hz our slew corrected\ntime resolution is 78 ps The time of arrival of the pulses from the four multiplicity counters were\nalso digitized using Fastbus TDC channels and each counter was slew corrected We have defined the time as measured by the multiplicity counter to be the\nfour-fold average of the individual times from the four counters To obtain the\ntime resolution of the multiplicity counter we give in Fig 10 the distribution\nof the average time minus the start time as measured by the beam counter When fitted to a Gaussian this distribution gives a σ of 250 ps which is the\ntime resolution for our multiplicity counter ###### 5",
    "###### 5 Summary\n\nWe have developed and tested a beam counter and multiplicity detector\nsystem at an incident beam rate of 10 [7] Au ions s [−][1] To our knowledge (based\non published results) this is the first time a quartz plate as thin as 150µm\nhas been successfully tested for a heavy ion beam counter The beam counter\nhas a time resolution of 100 ps at an incident beam rate of 1×10 [7] Hz and an\nenergy resolution of 12% An important feature of this beam counter is the\nlow average photomultiplier anode current (80 µA) drawn during a one second\nspill of 10 [7] Au ions The scintillator multiplicity counter provides a minimumbias, intermediate multiplicity and very high multiplicity (the highest 10% of\nthe multiplicity distribution) triggers The multiplicity counter has an overall\ntime resolution of 250 ps The beam counter and multiplicity detector system\nshow good stablity as the incident beam rate is varied from 10 [5] Hz to 10 [7] Hz ### Acknowledgements\n\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Department of Energy (DOE)\nHigh Energy Division, the DOE Nuclear Division and the machine shop support of the Physics department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst We would like to thank machinists Bob Verner and Richard Wilkey of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst for an excellent job of building the beam\nand multiplicity counters We also thank engineers Will Emmet and John Sinnott (Yale University) and Bill McGahern (BNL) for their design of the E864\nfront-end support systems and for their assistance in the final installation of\nthe counters in the BNL beamline ### References\n\n\n[1] see N Maeda et al , Nucl Instr",
