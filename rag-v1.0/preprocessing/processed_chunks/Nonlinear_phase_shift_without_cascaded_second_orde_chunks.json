    "A number of possible\nschemes of all-optical devices are discussed in Ref [6] [6] This letter theoretically predicts a new mechanism for nonlinear phase\nshift It is introduced when two waves with intensity-dependent amplitude\nratio interfere We also suggest optical schemes that one can use to obtain\nthe nonlinear phase shift of both fundamental wave and its second harmonics 1\n\n\nThe estimations show that the magnitude of the nonlinear shift may be\nseveral times as large as the one occurring due to cascaded processes under\nthe same value of exciting intensity and nonlinear medium length The essence of the proposed technique can be clarified by the following\nsimple considerations The phase Φ of the wave produced by interference of two waves is given,\nas it is known, by the expression:\n\n\n\nsin φ 1 + [a] a [2] 1 [sin][ φ] [2]\n\n1 + [a] 2 [2]\n\n� a [2] 1 [+ 2] [ a] a 1 [2] [cos(][φ] [1]\n\n\n\nsin Φ = sin φ 1 + [a] a [2] 1\n\n\n\na 1 (1)\n\n[ a] [2]\n\na 1 [cos(][φ] [1] [ −] [φ] [2] [)]\n\n\n\n1 + [a] 2 [2]\na [2] 1 [+ 2] [ a] a 1 [2]\n\n\n\nwhere a 1, a 2, φ 1, φ 2 are the corresponding amplitudes and phases of the\ninterfering waves If we happen to produce a dependence of the ratio a 2 /a 1\nupon intensity, obviously the phase Φ becomes dependent of the intensity To\nproduce this intensity-dependent ratio a 2 /a 1, we will use second harmonics\ngeneration Further calculations are shown on the example of two schemes The first\nallows one to have NPS in the second-harmonics beam, and the other outputs\nan NPS in the fundamental wave The first scheme (fig 1a) is essentially, a dispersion interferometer that\nmakes use of orthogonally polarized second harmonic waves [7] Both waves\nin the dispersion interferometer propagate along the same path Waves of\ndifferent frequencies correspond to the two arms of the interferometer, and\nthe relative phase is gained owing to the dispersion of the phase element In\nfig 1a: 1,3 — frequency doublers that use type II phase matching (although\nan analogous scheme can be constructed for the type I), 2 — phase element\n(like an optical wedge with a compensator), 4 — filter that cuts of the fundamental wave, 5 — polarizer or polarizing beam-splitter The elements have\nthe following orientation: the frequency doublers are oriented orthogonally,\nthe fundamental wave is polarized at 45 [0] angle with respect to the optical\naxes of the crystals The axis of the polarizer 5 is at the same angle as the\npolarization of the fundamental wave The described interferometer has following notable features owing to orthogonal polarization of the two second harmonic waves First, the second\nharmonics generated by the first doubler is not downconverted inside the\n\n\n2\n\n\nsecond crystal due to the large phase mismatch Second, the SH waves are\ngenerated in the first and the second crystals independently of each other and\ninterfere behind polarizer 5 Let’s write the complex amplitudes of the two\nsecond harmonic waves as a 1 [(2][ω][)] exp (iφ 1 ), a 2 [(2][ω][)] exp (iφ 2 ) The relative phase\n(φ 2 − φ 1 ) can be adjusted with a phase element, in our case, due to variable\nthickness of the optical wedge ∆l: ∆(φ 2 − φ 1 ) = [2] λ/ [π][∆] 2 [l] [[][n][(][ω][)][ −] [n][(2][ω][)], where]\n\nn(ω) and n(2ω) are refractive indices of the wedge material at frequencies\nω and 2ω Assume that the nonlinear phase effects inside each crystal are\nabsent or negligible, i",
    "Assume that the nonlinear phase effects inside each crystal are\nabsent or negligible, i e φ 1 and φ 2 are independent of the intensity This\nimplies the following conditions:\n\n\n∆kl 1,2 ≪ 1; n 2 Ilλ 1,2 ≪ 1, (2)\n\n\nwhere l 1, l 2 are the lengths of the first and second crystals, correspondly, ∆k\n— wave-vector mismatch between the fundamental and second harmonics, I\n— the incoming fundamental intensity The stated approximation essentially\nmeans that cascaded second-order processes and third-order nonlinearity do\nnot result in any tangible phase shifts Let’s show that the phase of the resulting wave Φ at the exit from the\ndispersion interferometer depends on intensity In the simplest case, when\none can neglect the group velocity dispersion, beam walk-off effect and use\nexact phase matching approximation ∆k = 0, amplitudes a 1 [(2][ω][)] and a 2 [(2][ω][)] are\ngiven by [8]:\n\n\na 1 [(2][ω][)] = I [1][/][2] th � l 1 4πχ [(2)] I [1][/][2] [�], (3)\n\n\n\n2 [�] [1][/][2]\na 2 [(2][ω][)] = I − (a 1 [(2][ω][)] ) th\n�\n\n\n\n2 [�] [1][/][2] [�]\nl 2 4πχ [(2)] I − (a 1 [(2][ω][)] ) � �\n\n\n\nExpressions (3) holds true while there is no initial second harmonics in the\nincident light In the second crystal this condition is maintained owing to\northogonal orientation of the crystals Behind polarizer 5, the waves interfere\nhaving the amplitudes a 1 [(2][ω][)] /√2 and a 2 [(2][ω][)] /√2 Thus, the dependence of the\n\n\n\n2 and a 2 [(2][ω][)] /√\n\n\n\nhaving the amplitudes a 1 /√2 and a 2 /√2 Thus, the dependence of the\n\namplitude ratio of the interfering waves can be calculated with the expression:\n\n\n\na 2 [(2][ω][)] = (1 − th [2] Kl 1 I [1][/][2] ) [1][/][2] th � Kl 2 I [1][/][2] (1 − th [2] Kl 1 I [1][/][2] ) �\n\n, (4)\n\na 1 [(2][ω][)] th Kl 1 I [1][/][2]\n\n\n3\n\n\nwhere K = 4πχ [(2)]",
    "Thus, the dependence of the\n\namplitude ratio of the interfering waves can be calculated with the expression:\n\n\n\na 2 [(2][ω][)] = (1 − th [2] Kl 1 I [1][/][2] ) [1][/][2] th � Kl 2 I [1][/][2] (1 − th [2] Kl 1 I [1][/][2] ) �\n\n, (4)\n\na 1 [(2][ω][)] th Kl 1 I [1][/][2]\n\n\n3\n\n\nwhere K = 4πχ [(2)] Let’s analyze qualitatively Eqs (1), (4) For I [1][/][2] [ <] ∼ K1l 1 [we have th][ α][ ∼] [α]\nand, hence, can simplify the formula:\n\n\n\na 2 [(2][ω][)]\n≈ [l] [2]\na 1 [(2][ω][)] l 1\n\n\n\n� 1 −K [2] l 1 [2] [I] � (5)\n\n\n\nIf l 2 ≫ l 1, then a 2 [(2][ω][)] /a 1 [(2][ω][)] ≫ 1 at low intensity and falls down as the intensity\ngrows In accordance with (1), at low intensity Φ ≈ φ 2, and at high intensity\nphase Φ is led to phase φ 1 The dependence of nonlinear phase shift ∆Φ NL upon dimensionless input\nintensity K [2] l [2] I (where l = l 1 + l 2 ) is shown in fig 1b, calculated according\nto (1), (4) The maximal nonlinear phase shift possible to achieve is limited\nto the relative phase φ 2 − φ 1, that explains the saturation of the curve in\nfig 1b In fig 2, we see the dependence of ∆Φ NL and I 2ω /I upon the relative\nphase (φ 2 − φ 1 ) The nonlinear phase shift can be either positive (leading to\nbeam self-defocusing), or negative (self-focusing), depending on (φ 2 − φ 1 ) It\nis easily seen that the maximum shift is produced at φ 2 − φ 1 ≈ πn, however\nthe SH output in contrast to it is at minimum, despite of nearly 100% secondharmonic generation efficiency at the given exciting intensity The reason is\nthat only a part of SH radiation passes through the polarizer, namely, the\ncomponent which has the nonlinear phase shift Of course, the phase of the\nfundamental wave in this scheme is not dependent of the intensity To obtain a nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental wave we can suggest\nas an example a scheme similar to a polarizing interferometer with the use\nof frequency doublers The mechanism of the nonlinear phase shift here is\nanalogous to that of the dispersion interferometer, namely, due to the interference of the waves with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio The scheme\ndiagram is shown in fig 3a",
    "3a The interferometer consists of frequency doubler\n1 where type I phase matching occurs, polarization-sensitive phase element\n2, filter 3 which cuts of SH, and polarizer 4 (or polarizing beam-splitter) We are interested in phase of the fundamental wave at the exit from\nthe interferometer Assume the incident wave is linearly polarized and has\nintensity I Inside the crystal there will be an ordinary wave of intensity\n\n\n4\n\n\nI cos [2] ξ and extraordinary wave of intensity I sin [2] ξ, where ξ is the angle\nbetween the incident polarization and the polarization of the ordinary wave After the polarizer, which is oriented at 45 [0] with respect to the ordinary wave,\nthere will be interference between a fraction of the extraordinary wave and\nthe corresponding fraction of the ordinary one Their amplitudes we denote\nas a [ω] 1 [and][ a] [ω] 2 [, correspondly Provided that there is type I phase matching, the]\ngeneration of SH will decrease the amplitude of only one of the fundamental\nwaves Let’s assume, for certainty, the ordinary wave is partially converted\ninto the extraordinary wave of SH, and the other fundamental wave (losses\nneglected) does not vary in intensity Obviously, the amplitude ratio of the\nfundamental waves will depend on the input intensity:\n\n\na [ω] 2 1/2 | cos ξ|\na [ω] 1 = � 1 − th [2] (KlI [1][/][2] cos ξ) � | sin ξ| [ ] (6)\n\n\nVarying angle ξ, we can thus change ratio a [ω] 2 [/a] [ω] 1 [, at low intensity ]\nExpanding (1) with the expression given by (6) we will have the dependence of the resulting wave phase Φ upon intensity The dependence of the nonlinear phase shift of fundamental wave on the\nincident intensity is demonstrated in fig 3b, as well as the dependence of\noutput intensity on the incident one In the scheme shown in fig 3a, the nonlinear distortion of the fundamental\nbeam in the output of interferometer (focusing or defocusing) also takes place,\nwhich can be controlled by variation of relative phase The latter is changed\nby a polarization-sensitive phase element, in this case As well as cascaded processes, the described mechanism of ultrafast nonlinearity produces a nonlinear phase shift of a wave without changing refractive index of a medium These mechanisms of nonlinearity have, essentially,\nthe similar nature Indeed, NPS occurring at cascading of quadratic processes\nactually arises from the interference of the incoming fundamental wave and\nthe wave downconverted with a shifted phase from second harmonics The\ndifference is in the way the interfering waves are produced As an analogue to the nonlinear coefficient n 2 for cubic nonlinearity, in\nparallel with second-order cascaded processes, one can introduce the effective\nrefractive index n [eff] 2 = ∆Φ NL c/ωlI for the ”interference” mechanism (twowave interference with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio) We compare\nn [eff] 2 for ”interference” phase shift of fundamental wave at ∆kl = 0 to n [eff] 2 [,]\nrelated to cascaded second-order processes calculated for optimal mismatch\n\n\n5\n\n\n|∆kl| ≈ 3 [5, 9] The comparison at K [2] l [2] I ≤ 10, that corresponds to I ≤\n22 GW/cm [2] for 1-mm-thick KTP [9], shows that the discussed interference\nmechanism gives at φ 2 − φ 1 ≥ 3π/4 the value of n [eff] 2 about 2 ÷ 3 times as\nlarge as, cascaded second-order processes do, while at φ 2 − φ 1 ≈ π/2 these\nmechanisms produce comparable nonlinear phase shifts The proposed technique makes it possible to produce nonlinear phase\nshift without cascaded second-order processes and cubic nonlinearity The\ncascaded processes are eliminated by exact phase matching ∆k = 0 and\nmutually orthogonal orientation of the crystals In real materials, n 2 for\nfast cubic nonlinearity is much smaller than n [eff] 2 for second-order processes,\nfor instance, in KTP n 2 ≈ 0 1n [eff] 2 [9] Nevertheless, if we allow for inertial\ncubic nonlinearity (τ ≈ 1 ns) [10] for nanosecond pulses n 2 exceeds n [eff] 2 [ For]\nexperimental observation of the isolated effect in such case one must use\npicosecond pulses to eliminate the influence of slow nonlinearity We have demonstrated a new method for obtaining fast nonlinear shift The effect has a simple and intuitive interpretation, and is related to interference of two waves with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio caused by\nsecond harmonic generation Sign and value of the nonlinear phase shift is\ngiven by the relative phase of the waves introduced by phase element The\neffect of ”interference” nonlinear phase shift has properties similar to those\nof the nonlinear phase shift caused by cascaded second-order processes and\nhas several times higher n [eff] 2 then the latter Furthermore, this effect allows\nproducing NPS both of the fundamental and second-harmonic waves It worth noting the following features of described technique As we can\nsee in fig 3b, the output intensity weakly depends on the input one within\na rather wide region This property seems to be attractive for pulsations\ndamping The strong dependence of ∆Φ NL upon the relative phase near the\npoint π (for instance, in fig 2 ∆Φ NL changes from 0 95π to −0 95π as φ 2 −φ 1\nvaries within π/25) can be potentially useful for dispersion interferometry of\nnonlinear optical media [10, 11] The present investigation has been carried out with support of the
