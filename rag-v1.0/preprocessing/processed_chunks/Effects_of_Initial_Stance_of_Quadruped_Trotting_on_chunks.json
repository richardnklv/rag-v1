    "Quadruped\nwalking machine will overbalance and fall down if gait\nerrors accumulate to certain extent Inagaki and Kobayashi (Inagaki, K & Kobayashi, H ,\n1994) studied the problem carefully and investigated a\nmethod of using a weight oscillator built in the center of\nthe body to compensate the moment in sideways\ndirection The method is applicable if the distance from\nthe center of gravity to the supporting axis is short If the\ndistance is a bit longer, the effect of compensating is\nunfavorable (Kurazume, R et al , 2002) , 2002) It must also be\npointed out that the method does not compensate the\nmoment in lengthwise direction and seems to be\nincomprehensive Hawker and Buehler (Hawker, G &\nBuehler, M 2000) studied trotting gaits of Scout\nquadruped robot with a locking, unactuated knee and\ndiscussed trotting algorithms They neglected ground\n\n\n\ncontact in the simulation and used the planarizer to limit\nthe robot’s motion to the saggittal plane in the\nexperiments They thought it be the subject of future\nresearch to eliminate body roll about the diagonal axis Thus, the moment falling down around the supporting\naxis is modeled considering both sideways direction and\nlengthwise direction, and the angle of rotation around the\nsupporting diagonal line is derived in this paper Next,\nthe effects of the moment on body attitude and walking\nstability are analyzed The analysis indicates that the\ndegree of influence varies with different initial stances of\nquadruped Finally we get the optimal initial stance of\nquadruped in trotting gait with maximal walking stability\nand simulation results are presented **2",
    "**2 Mechanical Modelling**\n\nAs the projection of gravity G in the supporting plane is\nnot on the supporting diagonal line, which causes a\nmoment falling down around the supporting axis as\nillustrated in Fig 1( θ means the angel of rotation) Quadruped walking machine will rotate around the axis\nbecause of action of the moment We want to learn how\nmuch it influences rotation and walking stability We assume the followings:\n1 The two supporting legs on the supporting diagonal\nline always contact supporting ground in the 1st half of\ncycle period of walking and the robot only rotates around\n\n\n003\n\n\nthe axis without other rotations In the 1st half of cycle\nperiod of walking, quadruped robot starts to walk and\nthere is no obvious collision with the ground In other\nperiods of walking, the swinging legs will touch ground\nwith collision and the assumption is not true probably Fig 1 Quadruped walking machine rotates around the\nsupporting diagonal line\n\n\n\n_mgl_\n\nε = (2)\n_I_\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2 Projection of the trot gait in the terrain\n\n2 Four legs of the robot are massless and the mass of the\nrobot is concentrated on the body 3 The action of joint torque on the body is neglected It\nis significantly smaller compared to that of the rotating\nmoment we are analyzing because gear ratio makes them\nnot in the same order This assumption is very important\nfor the next analysis 4 Quadruped machine walks with constant speed 5 The terrain is rigid, regular and even In order to illuminate dynamics relations, according to\nprevious assumptions, especially assumption 1, 2 and 3,\nwe have this equation by Euler’s theorem in the 1st cycle\nperiod of walking:\n\n_mgl_ = _I_ ε (1)\n\nwhere _m_ is the mass of the quadruped walking machine,\n\n_g_ is acceleration of gravity, _l_ is the distance between\n\nthe projection of center of gravity(COG) in the terrain\nand the supporting diagonal line, _I_ is the moment of\ninertia of the robot and ε is angular acceleration of the\nrotation It must be clarified again that (1) may be not true without\nassumption 1 to 3",
