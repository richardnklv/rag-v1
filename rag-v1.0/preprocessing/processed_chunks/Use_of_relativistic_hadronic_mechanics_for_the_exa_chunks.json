    "857406, (1 1)\n\n\nwhile its representation via nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (QM) on Dstates yields the familiar epression (see, e g , [1]) theor\nµ QM = g N + g p = 0 880, (1 2)\n\n\n(where g p and g n are the gyromagnetic factors of the protons and neutron,\nrespectively) which is about 26 % off in excess of the experimental value It is known that the use of all possible correction via relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) on a mixture of S-, D- and P -states can reduce the\nabove deviation down to about 1 %, but RQM cannot produce an exact\nrepresentation of µ [exp] D [, as confirmed by the recent studies [2] ]\nIt is equally known that the remaining 1 % deviation cannot be eliminated\nvia quark theories because, unlike the corresponding case in the atomic structure, the quark orbits are very small, and their polarization yields corrections\nto the total magnetic moment of nucleons of the order of 10 [−][3] % A similar situation exists for representation of the total magnetic moment\nof the tritium helium and other few-body nuclei The most plausible explanation of the above occurrence was formulated\nby the Founding Father of nuclear physics in the late 1940’s immediately\nafter the identification of the numerical value (1 1) For instance, in p 31\nof [1] one can read: “It is possible that the intrinsic magnetism of nucleon is\ndifferent when it is in close proximity to another nucleon ”\n\n\n3\n\n\nRecall that nucleons are not point like, but have an extended charge distribution with the radius of about 1 fm (10 [−][13] cm) Since perfectly rigid\nbodies do not exist in the universe, it is plausible to expect that such distribution can be deformed under sufficient external forces But the deformation\nof a charged and spinning sphere implies a necessary alteration of its intrinsic\nmagnetic moment, as established by classical electrodynamics The above “historical hypothesis” (as referred to hereon) therefore assumes that, when a proton and a neutron are coupled into the deuteron\nor other nuclear structure, their charge distributions are altered by the nuclear force, resulting in an alteration of their conventional intrinsic magnetic\nmoments as measured in vacuum In turn the assumption of a departure\nfrom standard quantum values of the magnetic moments of nucleons readily\npermits an exact representation of the total magnetic moment of few-body\nnuclei, as we shall see in Sect 4",
    "4 Since no exact representation of µ [exp] D has been achieved via conventional\nintrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons following about three-quarter of a\ncentury of attempts, µ [exp] D should be assumed to constitute direct experimental evidence on the alterability of the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons\nin the transition from motion in vacuum to motion within nuclear structure Note that the representation of µ [exp] D requires a decrease of the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons, and that such a decrease can only occur for a\nprolate deformation of nucleons referred to their spin axis FIGURE 1 The historical hypothesis on the alterability of the\nintrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons A schematic view of the historical hypothesis on the deformability of the intrinsic magnetic moments\nof nucleons which constitutes the main topic of study of this paper As\nwe hope to illustrate, the above hypthesis may stimulate a new scientific\nrenaissance in nuclear physics because it is beyound realistic means of quantitative representation via the Poincar´e symmetry and RQM, thus requiring\ntheir structural generalizations with far reaching implications of conceptual,\ntheoretical, experimental and applicative character Note finally that the above historical hypothesis is model independent,\ni e , it applies independently from any assumed structure of the nucleons, and\n\n\n4\n\n\nconsists of the geometric deformation of their charge distributions whatever\nthe constituents are Additional preliminary experimental evidence on the alterability of the\nintrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons were conducted from 1975 to 1979\nby H Rauch and his associates [3] via interferometric measures of the 4π\nspinorial symmetry of the neutron The measures are performed via a familiar\nperfect crystal which splits a thermal neutron beam into two branches which\nare then coherently recombined In one (or both) branches experiments [3]\nplaced an electromagnet calibrated at 7,496 G which, for the conventional\nvalue of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the neutron, would yield an exact\nmultiple of two complete (4π = 720 [◦] ) spin flips, as requested by the FermiDirac character of the neutron and as necessary for a coherent recombination In order to improve accuracy, the experimenters filled up the electromagnet gap with Mu-metal sheets which reduce stray fields [3] While crossing\nthe electromagnet gap, the neutron beam is therefore exposed to the field of\n7,496 G as well as to the intense electric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of\nMu-metal nuclei The best interferometric measures date back to 1979 with\nre-elaboration done in 1981 [3e], and are given by\n\n\nθ = 715 37 [◦] ± 3 8 [◦], θ min = 712 07 [◦], θ max = 719 67 [◦] (1 3)\n\n\nSuch, they do not contain 720 [◦] in the minimal and maximal values However,\nthe deviation is smaller than the error and, therefore, the above measures\nare inconclusive Similar measures were conducted in 1975 by S A Werner and his associates [3f] although also with unsettled results To our best knowledge,\nno additional interferometric measures have been done for the 4π spinorial\nsymmetry of the neutron since 1979, thus indicating the need for final tests\nwhich are now permitted in view of the technological advances and improved\naccuracy occurred since the late 1970’s Despite the above unsettled character, measures (1 3) are significant,\nas shown in theoretical studies [4] In this respect let us recall the (p, q)deformations of Lie algebras first introduced by Santilli [4a] back in 1967 as\npart of his Ph D studies with product (A, B) = p × A × B − q × B × A of Albert’s [4a] Lie-admissible type, where p, q, and p ± q are nonzero parameters\nand A × B is the usual associative product By using the preceding deformations Eder [4c,4d] has shown that the\n\n\n5\n\n\nalteration of the charge distribution of the neutron caused by the intense\nelectric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of Mu-metal nuclei could indeed\nyield “spin fluctuations” with about 1 % deviation of the intrinsic magnetic\nmoment which is precisely in order of magnitude needed for the resolution\nof the historical problem of total nuclear magnetic moments Note that the\nstrong interactions of Mu-metal nuclei have an irrelevant conribution here\nbecause their sectional area along the thermal neutron beam is very small Also, all median angles measured in tests [3] (with the electromagnet gap\nfilled up with Mu-metal sheets) are smaller than the expected 720 [◦] This\noccurrence was studied by Santilli [4e] via the first (p, q)-deformations of the\nSU(2) spin algebra and called angle slow-down effect This apparent effect\nis significant inasmuch as it requires a decrease of the standard magnetic\nmoment of the neutron for the (polarized) conditions of the experimental set\nup which is precisely in line with the decrease of the same magnetic moments\nneeded for the interpretation of µ [exp] D [, as recalled earlier ]\nThe electric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of Mu-metal nuclei are\nknown and result to be of order (in average) of 20,000 G The biggest unknown is the deformability of the charge distribution of neutrons under known\nexternal fields, which can only be established from µ [exp] D for the deuteron conditions are done in Sect 4, or via interferometric measures for more general\nconditions As noted earlier, 4π-interferometric tests can only measure the deformability of neutrons under the intense electric and magnetic fields of the Mumetal (or other heavy) nuclei, but not under the strong nuclear forces as\noccuring in the structure of the deuteron However, it is known from classical electrodynamics that a small deformation of a spinning and charged sphere can yield a relatively large change\nof its magnetic moment Also, the deformability of the charge distributions\nof nucleons in the deuteron structure may eventually be due to the electric\nand magnetic fields of the nucleons themselves Intense electric and magnetic\nfields of large, many-body nuclei could therefore approximate sufficiently well\nthe electric and magnetic fields of the two-body deuteron The above aspects, combined with the resolution of the still open historical hypothesis as well as with its implications pointed out in Sect 5, are\nsufficient to warrant the study of novel methods for the exact representation of µ [exp] D, as well as the finalization of interferometric measures on the\n4π-spinorial symmetry of the neutron 6\n\n\n## 2 Expected lack of exact character of quan- tum mechanics for the nuclear structure\n\nQM is fully established as being exactly valid for the so-called exterior\nproblems, here referred to as particles moving in vacuum under action-at-adistance/potential interactions at sufficiently large mutual distances to allow\nan effective point-like approximation of their wavepackets and/or charge distributions, as occurring in the atomic structure and electroweak interactions\nat large In fact, QM provided an exact representation of all experimental\ndata available for the systems considered",
    "In fact, QM provided an exact representation of all experimental\ndata available for the systems considered FIGURE 2 Experimental insufficiencies of quantum mechanics\nin nuclear physics QM is exactly valid in the atomic structure because it\nprovided an exact representation and understanding of all its experimental\ndata On the same grounds, QM cannot be exactly valid for the nuclear\nstructure, because it has been unable to provide an exact representation of\nvarious experimental data For instance, total nuclear magnetic moments do\nnot follow QM predictions, but are within minimal and maximal values reproduced in this figure from [1] which motivated the historical hypothesis of\nFig 1 Additional insufficiencies exist for: nuclear forces; nuclear structures;\ntotal angular momenta; and other aspects Needless to say, QM provides an\nexcellent approximation of nuclear data We are therefore referring to deviations which are generally small, yet they have rather important implications,\nas indicated in Sects 4 and 5 By comparison, QM is not expected to be exactly valid for the so-called\ninterior problems, here referred to particles whose wavepackets or charge\ndistributions cannot be effectively approximated as being point-like because\nmoving at small mutual distances (of the order of 1 fm), as occurring in the\nstructure of nuclei (as well as of hadrons and stars not considered in this\npaper) The understanding is that the approximate validity of QM in nuclear\nphysics is out of scientific debate We are therefore referring to expected\nsmall deviations from QM treatments 7\n\n\nThe reasons for the above occurrence are numerous",
    "7\n\n\nThe reasons for the above occurrence are numerous First, unlike the\ncorresponding atomic case, QM has been unable to provide an exact representation of all nuclear experimental data The lack of exact representation\nof total nuclear magnetic moments considered in Sect 1 is only one of\nseveral isufficiencies As an example, Ref [1] indicates the existence of additional lack of final understanding of: nuclear structures, total nuclear angular\nmomenta, and other aspects The above experimental insufficiencies can be established in a rigorous\ntheoretical way via primitive symmetry principles Computer visualizations\nof the fundamental summetry of QM, the Galilean symmetry G(3 1) or the\nPoincar´e symmetry P(3 1), establish their exact validity for Keplerian systems, that is, for systems of particles without collisions admitting their heaviest element in the center (Keplerian center) This confirms the exact character of QM for the atomic structure By comparison, nuclei do not possess nuclei and, consequently, the Galilei\nand Poincar´e symmetries cannot be exact for the nuclear structure In fact,\nthe lack of Keplerian center requires a necessary breaking of the above symmetries In turn, any expectation of achieving via QM an exact representation of all nuclear data under these conditions has no theoretical ground Not surprisingly, the latter aspects are deeply linked to the preceding ones In fact, according to the Galilean and Poincar´e symmetries in their conventional realization (see Sect 3 for a more general realization) the intrinsic\nmagnetic moment of nucleons is perennial and immutable Any quantitative\nrepresentation of the historical hypothesis of their deformability therefore\nrequires a necessary deviation from the above symmetries, thus confirming\nthe mutual compatibility of the two aspects Both preceding aspects can be rigorously established on dynamical grounds QM was established for the characterization of action-at-a-distance interactions solely derivable from a potential and this confirms again its exact\nvalidity for the atomic structure, this time on dynamical grounds By comparison, nucleons in a nuclear structure are in an average state\nof mutual penetration of about 10 [−][3] parts of their charge distribution [4f] But hadrons are some of the densest objects measured in a laboratory until\nnow This indicates the presence in the nuclear force of interactions which\nare: 1) of contact, i e , of zero-range type; 2) nonlinear in the wavefunctions\nand possibly their derivatives; 3) nonlocal of a type requring an integral over\nthe volume of overlapping; 4) nonpotential in the sense of violating the condi\n\n8\n\n\ntions to be derivable from a potential or a Hamiltonian; and 5) of cosequential nonunitary type By recalling the strictly action-at-a-distance, linear,\nlocal-differential, Hamiltonian and unitary character of QM, the preceding\ncharacteristics of the nuclear force due to mutual penetration of the hyperdense charge distribution of nucleons are dramatically beyond any hope of\nquantitative QM treatment It should be stressed again that the above isufficiencies cannot be resolved\nvia the transition to quark theories on numerous, independent, experimental\nand theoretical grounds Besides their inability to achieve the needed exact\nrepresentation of all nuclear data, the current theories on the hadronic structure are also of action-at-a-distance, linear, local-differential, Hamiltonian\nand unitary character, thus being unable to represent the above expected\ncharacteristics of the nuclear force FIGURE 3",
    "FIGURE 3 Theoretical insufficiences of quantum mechanics in\nnuclear phusics An illustration of the theoretical impossibility for QM to\nbe exactly valid for the nuclear structure due to its lack of Keplerian center\nwhich requires a necessary breaking of the Galilean and Poincar´e symmetries In turn, the above occurrence is only a consequence of the fundamental theoretical insufficiencies of QM to represent nucleons as extended, nonspherical\nand deformable charge distribution, as well as the inability to represent the\ncomponent in the nuclear force expected from their mutual penetration which\nis of contact, nonlinear, nonlocal, nonhamiltonian and nonunitary type An\naxiom-preserving broadening of QM and its underlying symmetries capable\nof providing a quantitative representation of the above characteristics is outlined in Sect 3 and applied in Sect 4 4 Also, quark theories in their conventional formulation are affected by still\nunresolved basic problems, such as: the lack of a rigorous confinement of\nthe unobservable quarks as prohibited by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle;\nthe inability of quarks to be a representation of the Poincar´e symmetry,\nthus preventing their mathematical parameters called “masses” from being\nrigorously defined in our space-time (as the eigenvalues) of the second-order\nCasimir invariant of P(3 1)); the complete lack of gravity for any nucleus\nassumed to be made up of quarks because of the impossibility of defining\n\n\n9\n\n\ngravity in current quark theories (gravity is solely defined in our spce-time\nwhile quarks are solely defined in a mathematical unitary space without\ninterconnections due to the O’Raifeartaigh theorem or known resolution via\nsupersymmetric models) Thus, any attempts at shifting open problems in our current description of\nnucleons in our space-time to other, considerably more serious, open problems\nin their quark constituents, is a de facto abandonment of the search for a\ndeeper understanding of the nuclear force and structure This leaves no other choice than the search, conducted in Sect 3, of a\nbroadening-covering of QM capable of providing a quantitative representation of the nuclear aspects under consideration The above aspects can be best illustrated via open problem of the total\nmagnetic moments of few-body nuclei In fact, any quantitative study of\nthe historical hypothesis herein considered requires the introduction of the\nfollowing new notions:\n1) The extended, nonspherical and deformable shape of the charge distribution of nucleons, expectedly of spheroidal ellipsoidic character, hereon\nrepresented with the quantities n 1 [2], n 2 [2], n 3 [2], n k ̸= 0, k = 1, 2, 3, which are\nfunctions of intensity of external fields and any other needed local2 characteristic For particles with spin along the third axis, the above quantities\nrepresent a spheroidal ellipsoids which are oblate for n 1 [2] = n 2 [2] - n 3 [2] and\nprolate for n 1 [2] = n 2 [2] < n 3 [2] The evident condition of preserving the original\nvolume of nucleons then yields the normalization hereon assumed\n\n\n2 2 2 2 2 2\nn 1 × n 2 × n 3 = 1, n 1 = n 2      - or < n 3 (2 1)\n\n\n[It should be noted that in other cases the normalization n 1 [2] + n 2 [2] + n 3 [2] = 3\nmay be preferable] 2) The density of the medium in which motion occurs hereon represented\nwith the functions n 4 [2] which, for the vacuum, is assumed to have the normalized value n 4 [2] = 1, and we shall write\n\n\nn 42 = 1, < 1, or > 1 (2 2)\n\n\nAs we shall see in Sect 3, n 4 is in reality the local index of refraction of\nlight, thus characterizing the local causal speed 3) The alteration called mutation [6b] of the intrinsic magnetic moment\nµ N of nucleons N = n, p, hereon expressed with the symbol ˆµ N = ˆµ N (µ N,\n\n\n10\n\n\nn µ [2], ), µ = 1, 2, 3, 4, with ˆµ N - µ N for oblate deformations and ˆµ N < µ N\nfor prolate ones, where the term “mutation” is preferred over “deformation”\nto indicate the fact that the underlying methods [6] (see the next sections)\nare structurally different than the known “quantum deformations” [4] of the\ncurrent literature It is evident that the nonspherical and deformable characteristics (2 1)\nare beyond any representational capability of QM because the latter can\nonly represent perfectly spherical and perfectly rigid particles, as necessary\nin order not to violate the fundamental rotational symmetry O(3) It should\nbe stressed that the same occurrence persists in second-quantization and\nrelated form-factors which cannot represent the main characteristics of the\nhistorical hypothesis under study here By comparison, any real treatment of\nthe historical hypothesis requires ab initio the representation of nonspherical\nand deformable particles The above limitations of QM are well known to be inherent in the very\nstructure of its fundamental carrier spaces, the Euclidean space E = E(r, δ, R)\nwith coordinates r = {r [k] }, k = 1, 2, 3, and metric δ = diag (1, 1, 1) over\nthe field of real numbers R = R(n, +, ×) and the Minkowski space M =\nM(x, η, R) with coordinates x = {x [µ] }, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4, and metric η =\ndiag (+1, +1, +1, −1) over R In fact, the basic unit of E, I = diag {1, 1, 1}\n(which is the space component of the unit of M) represents a perfect and\nrigid sphere Moreover, the theory of deformations is well known to be incompatible with the above spaces, their symmetries and, consequently, QM",
    "Moreover, the theory of deformations is well known to be incompatible with the above spaces, their symmetries and, consequently, QM Alternatively, it is easy to see that deviations from the exact 720 [◦] in\nthe 4π interferometric measures (1 3) imply a deviation from the familiar\nspinorial component of Dirac’s wavefunction,\n\n\nψ [′] = R(θ 3 ) × ψ = e [iγ] [1] [γ] [2] [θ] [3] [/][2] × ψ,\n\n\nwhere the γ’s are the conventional gamma matrices This is the very reason\nwhy the experiment is called the 4π spinorial symmetry test In fact, mutations of the intrinsic magnetic moment of nucleons imply a\ndeparture from its characterization via Dirac’s equation from which a departure from law (2 3) follows At any rate, for an angle of spin flip different\nthan 720 [◦], spinorial law (2 3) cannot represent the physical setting The above occurrences then leave no other choice than the search for a\nsuitable covering of QM which is more effective for a quantitative represen\n\n11\n\n\ntation of the nuclear aspects under consideration In the next section we introduce a new representation of extended, nonspherical and deformable hadrons with main characteristics (2 1) and (2 2)\nwhich implies a covering of the spinorial law (2 3) suitable for the exact representation of 4π interferometric measures of type (1 3) and, therefore, of the\nmagnetic moment of few-body nuclei Particularly important is the achievement in the next section, apparently\nfor the first time, of a generalization of the spinorial law (2 3) without altering the spin of nucleons and other QM laws The latter advances are\nneeded to dispel a rather general expectation in the earlier studies in the\nfield that a possible confirmation of data (1 3) would imply a departure from\nthe Fermi-Dirac character of the nucleon, with consequential inconsistency\nwith established nuclear laws, e g , Pauli’s exclusion principle In fact, departures from conventional spin values are present in the “spin fluctuations”\nof Ref [4c], the first SU (p,q) (2) quantum group [4e], the proposed test of\nPauli’s principle under external strong interactions [4f] and are inherent in\nall subsequent q-deformations [4g,4h] In this paper we present the application of the new formulations of Sect",
    "In this paper we present the application of the new formulations of Sect 3\nfor the apparently first, exact representation of the total magnetic moments of\nfew body nuclei We then show that 4π-interferometric measures can indeed\nprovide its independent verification We finally point out other applications\nand expected far reaching implications ## 3 Relativistic hadronic mechanics\n\n\nThe insufficiencies of QM for the nuclear structure as well as for interior\nsystems in general have been recognized by various research groups This has\nstimulated the appearance in recent decades of various studies on possible\nstructural generalizations of QM A first attempt was that initiated by Santilli [4b] with the parameter\n(p, q)-deformations of QM with generalized product (A, B) = p × A × B −\nq × B × A of Albert’s Lie-admissible type, generalized time evolution iA [˙] =\n(A, H), and SU p,q (2) quantum structure [4e,4f] By the time Biedenharn [4g] and Macfarlane [4h] initiated their studies of\nthe simpler class of (1, q)-deformations in the mid 1980’s (thereafter followed\nby a very large number of papers), the author had already abandoned this\n\n\n12\n\n\nline of inquiry because of its rather serious problems of physical consistency\nidentified, e g , in Refs [5] [5] In fact, (p, q)-time evolutions are evidently nonunitary, i e , they have\nthe structure U × U [†] ≠ I As such, they are not invariant under their\nown time evolution which induces the broader operator (P, Q)-deformations\n\n[6a,6b] with generalized product (Aˆ,B) = A × P × B − B × Q × A also of\nAlbert’s Lie-admissible type with P = q × (U × U [†] ) [−][1] and Q = q × (U ×\nU [†] ) [−][1], generalized time evolution iA [˙] = (Aˆ,H), and correspondingly broader\nSU P,Q (2) deformations The problematic aspects [5] originate from the fact that, after having\nbeen achieved via nonunitary transforms, the latter structures are themselves\nnot form-invariant under further nonunitary transforms, thus lacking the\naxiomatic consistensy of QM More generally, all existing deformations of QM with a nonunitary time\nevolution [4], including q-, k-, quantum-, (p, q)- and (P, Q)-deformations,\nwhen formulated on conventional Hilbert spaces over conventional fields have\nthe following rather serious problematic aspects of physical nature [5]: 1)\nthe basic unit is not invariant, thus preventing unambiguous applications\nto experiments; 2) Hermiticity is not conserved in time, thus preventing the\nexistence of unambiguous observables; 3) special functions and transforms are\nnot unique and invariant, thus implying lack of uniqueness and invariance of\nnumerical predictions and physical laws; and other problems Most importantly, all the preceding deformations imply the violation\nof the special relativity, e g , because the deformed Minkowski space and\nPoincar´e symmetry are not isomorphic to the origin ones (see, e g , [4j]) This creates the problem of identifying new axioms replacing Einstein’s axioms, establishing their axiomatic consistency and, after that, proving them\nexperimentally In this paper we shall use a third class of covering formulations [6] which\napparently resolve the above problematic aspects, thus permitting quantitative studies with invariant basic unit, invariant Hermiticity-observability,\nunique and invariant special functions, numerical predictions and physical\nlaws, yet possessing a nonunitary structure as evidently necessary for novelty Above all, the covering formulations presented in this section are based\non the central requirement of preserving the axioms of the special relativity at the abstract level and merely realize them in a more general way 13\n\n\nThis illustrates the reasons for our insistence in using terms different than\n“deformations” [4], such as “mutations” [6] The emerging theory is known under the name of hadronic mechanics\n(HM), today also known (for certain reasons identified below) as “isotopic\ncompletion” of quantum mechanics, as originally proposed by the author\nin [6a,6b] and subsequently studied by numerous researchers (see [7] for independent studies and comprehensive bibliographies), and outlined in the\nrecent monographs [6j,6k] The formulation which is necessary for the study of the historical hypothesis of Fig 1, and its application to total nuclear magnetic moments is\nrelativistic hadronic mechanics (RHM) or “isotopic completion” of RQM Its\nstudy in Refs [6j,6k] is made for the most general possible mutations as apparently needed for extreme, interior, hadronic and astrophysical conditions In this section we shall present the apparently first formulation of RHM\nspecifically conceived for nuclear physics under the crucial condition of representing the historical hypothesis of Fig 1 In so doing, we shall show, also\nfor the first time, that RHM can provide the above representation while preserving all conventional QM laws, such as Heisenberg’s uncertainties, Pauli’s\nexclusion principle, etc RHM is constructed via maps of RQM called isotopies [6a] from the Greek\nmeaning of being “axiom-preserving” and referred to maps of any given linear, local-differential and unitary theory into its most general possible nonlinear, nonlocal-integral and nonunitary extensions which are nevertheless\ncapable of reconstructing linearity, locality and unitarity in certain generalized spaces called isospaces, and generalized fields called isofields It then follows that isotopic images of fields, spaces, algebras, etc , are\nisomorphic to the original structures by conception and construction, and\nthey coincide at the abstract, realization free level, all this as preparatory\ngrounds to preserve Einsteinian axioms of the special relativity Nevertheless,\nas we shall see shortly, the two theories are physically inequivalent because\nconnected by nonunitary transforms Recall that the most dominant aspect of the predicted new terms in the\nnuclear force is that of not being representable with a Hamiltonian and, of being nonunitary (otherwise we trivially remain within the class of equivalence\nof RQM) The best way to construct the foundations of RHM is therefore by\nsubjecting the corresponding foundations of RQM to nonunitary transforms The fundamental quantities of RQM are: the basic unit of the underlying\n\n\n14\n\n\nMinkowski space, I = diag ({1, 1, 1}, 1) in Euclidean space (say, 1 cm) and\nthe unit of time (say, 1 sec) in dimensionless form with ¯h = 1; the basic\nassociative product A × B among generic quantities A, B (which is the\nsame for all products of RQM, those of: numbers, operators, etc , including\nthe modular action H × |ψ⟩ of operators H on Hilbert states |ψ⟩); and the\nfundamental relativistic canonical commutation rules [p µ, x [ν] ] = p µ × x [ν] −\nx [ν] × p µ = −iδ µν × I Under nonunitary transforms, the above quantities become\n\n\nU × U [†] = I [ˆ] = I [ˆ] [†] ≠ I, (3 1a)\n\nI → I [ˆ] = U × I × U [†], (3 1b)\n\nA × B → A [ˆ] × [ˆ] B [ˆ] = U × A × B × U [†] = A [ˆ] × T [ˆ] × B, [ˆ] (3 1c)\n\nU × [p µ, x [ν] ] × U [†] = [ˆp µ ˆ,xˆ [ν] ] = ˆp µ × [ˆ] x [ν] − xˆ [ν] [ ˆ] ×pˆ µ = −iδ µν × ˆI, (3 1d)\n\n\nˆ ˆ\nT = (U × U [†] ) [−][1] = ˆI [−][1], K = U × K × U [†], K = A, B, p, x (3 1e)\n\n\nThe above new images are then assumed as the fundamental quantities of\nRHM A most dominant aspect of the above nonunitary transforms is that they\nimply the joint mapping, called lifting [6a], of the unit I → I [ˆ] while the\nproduct is lifted in an amount which is theˆ ˆ inverse of that of the unit, A×B →\nA× ˆB = ˆA × ˆT × ˆB, under which ˆI = ˆT [−][1] is the correct left and right unit\nof the new theory,\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ\nI ˆ× ˆA = ˆT [−][1] × ˆT × ˆA ≡ A×I = ˆA × ˆT × ˆT [−][1] ≡ A, ∀A, (3 2)\n\n\nwhich case (only) I [ˆ] is called the isounit and T [ˆ] the isotopic element [6a,6b] The emerging new operator envelope ξ is called isoassociative because it\nverifies the associative law with respect to the isoproduct, A [ˆ] × [ˆ] ( B [ˆ] × C [ˆ] ) =\n( A [ˆ] × [ˆ] B [ˆ] )× [ˆ] C [ˆ] Note that the new unit I [ˆ] is Hermitean and will therefore be\nassumed hereon to be positive-definite Under these conditions it is evident\nthat the original envelope ξ and its isotopic image ξ [ˆ] are isomorphic by central\nobjective, ξ ≈ ξ [ˆ], and the map ξ → ξ [ˆ] is an isotopy Yet they are physically\nnonequivalent because nonunitarily related The representation of system with RQM is done via the knowledge of\none operator only, the Hamiltonian H, under the tacit assumption of the\n\n\n15\n\n\nsimplest possible basic units I = diag ({1, 1, 1}, 1) The representation of\nsystems via RHM requires the knowledge of two quantities, the conventional\nHamiltonian H to represent conventional potential interactions, and a second\nquantity, the isounit I [ˆ], to represent all nonhamiltonian quantities We shall therefore assume hereon the realization of the isounit (for ¯h = 1),\n\n\nˆ 2 2 2 2\nI = diag (ˆI s, ˆI t ) = diag ({n 1, n 2, n 3 }, n 4 ) × ˆΓ(x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, ) > 0, (3 3a)\n\n\nIˆ s = diag {n 12, n 22, n 32 } × ˆΓ s (x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, ), ˆI t = n 42 × ˆΓ t (x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, ),\n(3 3b)\nwhere I [ˆ] s and I [ˆ] t are called the space and time isounits, respectively, the n k [2] ’s\nare quantities (2 1) representing the shape of the hadron considered, n 4 [2] is the\nquantity (2 2) representing the density of the medium in which motion occurs,\nand Γ is a positive-definite 4 [ˆ] × 4 matrix representing the contact, nonlinear,\nnonlocal, nonhamiltonian and nonunitary interactions (as identified in Sect 2) The functional dependence of the isounit remains completely unrestricted\nin RHM and must be determined from the characteristics of the case at hand\n\nexactly as it is the case of the Hamiltonian in RQM It is important to know that identifications (3 3) are made following the\nhistorical teaching by Hamilton, Lagrange, Jacobi and other Founders of\nanalytic dynamics according to which one quantity alone (we today call the\nHamiltonian or the Lagrangian) simply cannot represent the entire physical\nreality For this reason they formulated their analytic equations with external\n\nterms Comprehensive classical studies not reported here for brevity (see the\nreview and bibliography in [6j,6k]) have established that the use of isounits\n(3 3) is analytically equivalent to external terms and, in fact, they have the\nsame number of independent elements The reformulation of the external\nterms via the isounit has resulted to be necessary to preserve Einsteinian\naxioms of the special relativity beginning at the classical level because it\npermits the preservation of Lie’s theory which would be otherwise lost in\nfavor of the broader Lie-admissible theory [6a] These classical studies have resulted in a new analytic mechanics, called\nisohamiltonian mechanics which is the unique and unambiguous classical\nimage of the operator mechanics outlined in this section (see [6l] for the\nlatest studies and comprehensive bibliography) 16\n\n\nA criticism is at times moved according to which RHM is “too broad”\nbecause the isounit can have infinitely possible values This criticism is evidently equivalent to the statement that RQM is “too broad” because it\nadmits infinitely possible Hamiltonians In reality, both the Hamiltonian and the isounits are selected via fully\nidentified methods resulting in all applications considered until now in unique\nand unambiguous expressions The Hamiltonian is selected via all conventional criteria which are those of the exterior problems, such as mass, charge,\npotential, etc The isounit is instead selected on the new grounds of the\ninterior problems, thus requiring the description of extended, nonspherical\nand deformable shapes, density/index of refraction and contact interactions\nwhich are absent in the QM literature of this century At any rate, any quantitative representation of the historical hypothesis\nof Fig 1 requires the capability to represent all infinitely possible different\nshapes of the same nucleon, thus requiring for consistency infinitely many\npossible isounits for each given Hamiltonian Also, the noninitiated reader should know since these introductory lines\nthat, when an isolated interior system is considered from the outside, internal\nnonpotential effects must evidently averaged into constants because they are\nshort range, by therefore resulting in a mere rescaling of the shape and density\nterms via the constant factor Γ [ˆ] 0 = ⟨Γ [ˆ] ⟩ This occurrence renders preferable\nthe scale invariant description of the characteristic n-quantities, which will\nbe tacitly adopted hereon Once the basic isotopic unit, product and commutation rules are known,\nthe next step is the identification of the axiomatically correct structure of\nRHM Extensive studies in this respect completed only recently with the\nappearance of Ref [6l] have shown that RHM is as axiomatically consistent\nas RQM if and only if the nonunitary maps (3 1) are applied to the totality\nof the formalism of RQM, without any exception known to the author In\nfact, any mixtures of isotopic structure with conventional QM methods leads\nto a host of inconsistencies which generally remain undetected by nonexperts\nin the field This implies that the formalism of RQM must be reconstructed in such a\nway to admit I [ˆ], rather than 1, as the correct left and right unit Thus, numbers, metric spaces, geometries, symmetries, Hilbert spaces, etc , have to be\nreconstructed in terms of the isoproduct A× [ˆ] B with isounit I [ˆ] The construction is simple, yet unique and unambiguous, and is done below for the first\n\n\n17\n\n\ntime by deriving each new structure from the single nonunitary map (3 1),\nunder the notation according to which all quantities with a “hat” are computed in generalized spaces and those without are computed in conventional\n\nspaces ### 3 1 Isofields\n\n\nThe first notion of RQM which must be isotopically lifted in order to achieve\ninvariant units, Hermiticity and numerical predictions is that of the fields\nof ordinary real numbers R(n, +, ×) and complex numbers C(c, +, ×) with\nconventional sum a+b, additive unit 0, multiplication a×b and multiplicative\nunit I, a = n, c, resulting in the isofields [6f] R [ˆ] = R [ˆ] (ˆn, +, × [ˆ] ) and C [ˆ] (ˆc, +, × [ˆ] )\nof isoreal numbers ˆn = U × n × U [†] = n × I [ˆ] and isocomplex numbers ˆc =\nU × c × U [†] = c × I [ˆ], n ∈R, c ∈C, I [ˆ] ̸= R, C equipped with the conventional\nsum + [ˆ] ≡ + and related additive unit 0 [ˆ] ≡ 0, as well as with the isoproduct\nand related isounit\n\n\nˆ\naˆ× [ˆ] [ˆ] b = U × a × b × U [†] = ˆa × T [ˆ] × [ˆ] b, I = ˆT [−][1],\n\nIˆ ˆ×aˆ ≡ aˆ×ˆ Iˆ ≡ a,ˆ ∀a = n, c (3 4)\n\nThe important property is that R [ˆ] and C preserve all axioms of a field [6j] Thus, the liftings R → R [ˆ] and C → C [ˆ] are isotopies For consistency, all operations on numbers must then be isotopically lifted\nin a simple yet unique and significant way We have in this way the following\nisosquare, isosquare root, isoquotient, isonorm, etc (see [6f] for details) aˆ [2] = ˆa× [ˆ] aˆ = a [2] × I, [ˆ] aˆ ˆ 12 = a 11 × I [ˆ] 12,\n\n\nˆ\naˆ [ˆ] / [ˆ] b = (ˆa/ [ˆ] b) × I, [ˆ] |aˆ| = |a| × ˆI, a = n, c (3 5)\n\n\nThus the tradition statement “2 × 2 = 4” remained unchanged since\nbiblical times has meaning for RQM but has no meaning for RHM because\none must identify first the selected unit and product for the operation “2×2”\nto have sense This illustrates from the outset the insidious inconsistencies\n\nin attempting to appraise the new RHM via the use of old mathematics In short, RQM is defined for numbers n whose basic unit is the quantity\n+1 dating back to biblical times RHM is instead defined for new numbers\n\nˆ\nn = n × I [ˆ] which admit arbitrary (positive-definite) units I [ˆ] As we shall\n\n\n18\n\n\nsee shortly, the introduction of the new isonumbers has deep and intriguing\nimplications, including the possibility of defining new symmetries for conventional line elements and inner products ### 3 2 Iso-Hilbert spaces\n\n\nThe second notion of RQM which must be lifted for consistency is that of\nconventional Hilbert spaces H with states |ψ⟩, |φ⟩, , inner product ⟨φ|ψ⟩∈\nC and normalization ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1, resulting in the iso-Hilbert space H [ˆ] [6j] with\nthe following isostates, isoinner product and isonormalization\n\n\n⟨φ [ˆ][ˆ] |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ = U × ⟨φ| × U [†] × (U × U [†] ) [−][1] × U × |ψ⟩× U [†] =\n\n= ⟨φ [ˆ] | × T [ˆ] × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩× I [ˆ] ∈ C [ˆ], (3 6a)\n\n\n⟨ψ [ˆ] | × T [ˆ] × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ = 1, |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ = U × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩, ⟨φ [ˆ] | = ⟨φ| × U [†] (3 6b)\n\n\nNote that, again for consistency, the isoinner product must be an isocomplex number, i e , must have the structure ˆc = c × I [ˆ] The new composition\nis still inner (because T [ˆ] ⟩0) and, therefore, H [ˆ] is still Hilbert Then, H ≈H [ˆ]\nand the lifting H → H [ˆ] is again an isotopy The local isomorphism H ≈ H [ˆ] can also be seen from the following new\ninvariance law of the conventional Hilbert product here expressed for T [ˆ] independent from the integration variable,\n\n\n⟨φ|ψ⟩× I ≡⟨φ| × |ψ⟩× T [ˆ] × T [ˆ] [−][1] ≡⟨φ| × T [ˆ] × |ψ⟩× I [ˆ] ≡⟨φ [ˆ] |ψ⟩ (3 7)\n\n\nThus, RHM is based on conventional Hilbert spaces, only realized in a way\nmore general than that of current use 8\nThe isotopy H → H [ˆ] is equally fundamental for the consistency of the\ntheory To see it, note that, under the liftingˆ ˆ ˆ I → I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1] and A × B →\nA× ˆB = ˆA×T ˆ ˆ×B ˆ, the action of an operator H on a state must be isotopic,\ni e , of the type H [ˆ] ×| [ˆ] ψ [ˆ] ⟩ = H [ˆ] × T [ˆ] ×|ψ [ˆ] ⟩ because this is the only one admitting\nthe isounit I [ˆ] ×| [ˆ] ψ [ˆ] ⟩≡|ψ [ˆ] ⟩ Then the formulation of the above expression on a\nconventionalloss of Hermiticity In fact, we would have the condition Hilbert space with inner product ⟨φ [ˆ] | × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ {⟨implies the generalφ [ˆ] |× [ˆ] H [ˆ] ˆ† } × | ˆψ⟩ =\n\n\n19\n\n\n⟨φ [ˆ] | × {H [ˆ] ×| [ˆ] ψ [ˆ] ⟩}, i e , H [ˆ] ˆ† = ˆT −1 × H - × ˆT ̸= ˆH - On the contrary, the use of\nthe isoHilbert space implies the conditions\n\n\n{⟨φ [ˆ] |× [ˆ] H [ˆ] ˆ† }×|ˆ ˆψ⟩ = ⟨φˆ|×{ˆ ˆH ˆ×| ˆψ⟩}, i",
    "On the contrary, the use of\nthe isoHilbert space implies the conditions\n\n\n{⟨φ [ˆ] |× [ˆ] H [ˆ] ˆ† }×|ˆ ˆψ⟩ = ⟨φˆ|×{ˆ ˆH ˆ×| ˆψ⟩}, i e , Hˆ ˆ† = ˆH      - (3 8)\n\n\nAs a result, the conditions of Hermiticity and isohermiticity coincide,\nquantities which are Hermitean-observable for RQM remain so for RHM, the\neigenvalues of Hermitean operators of RHM are real, and other properties\n(see [6j] from brevity) The only possible isoeigenvalues equations are then given by\n\n\nˆ\nH ˆ×| ˆψ⟩ = ˆH(x, p) × ˆT (x, p, ψ, ∂ψ, ) × | ˆψ⟩ = ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ⟩ =\n\n= (E × I [ˆ] ) × T [ˆ] × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ = E × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ (3 9)\n\n\nwith corresponding isotopic expectation values\n\n\n\n⟨H [ˆ] ⟩ = [⟨][ψ][ˆ][|][×][ˆ] [H][ ˆ][ ˆ][×|][ ˆ][ψ][⟩]\n\n[ˆ] [ˆ] [ˆ]\n\n\n\n, (3 10)\n⟨ψ [ˆ] | × T [ˆ] × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩\n\n\n\n\n[|][×][ˆ] [H][ ˆ][ ˆ][×|][ ˆ][ψ][⟩]\n\n= [⟨][ψ][ˆ][| ×][ ˆ][T][ ×][ ˆ][H][ ×][ ˆ][T][ × |][ ˆ][ψ][⟩]\n⟨ψ [ˆ] |×| [ˆ] ψ [ˆ] ⟩ ⟨ψ [ˆ] | × T [ˆ] × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩\n\n\n\nwhich can be easily seen to coincide with the isoeigenvalues for the same\noperator Note from Eq s (3 9) that the “final numbers” of RHM to be\nconfronted with experiments are conventional The fundamental axioms of RHM, are a simple isotopy of the axioms of\nRQM here omitted for brevity [6k] We only mention for future needs the\naxiom The above elements illustrate the main property that RHM coincides\nwith RQM at the abstract realization-free level for which, from the positivedefiniteness of I [ˆ], we have R ≡ R [ˆ], C ≡ C [ˆ] and H ≡ H [ˆ] All other aspects\nof RHM are constructed following the same lines Thus, RHM is not a\nnew theory, but merely a new realization of the abstract axioms of RHM These properties then establish the axiomatic consistency of RHM to such\nan extent that any criticism in its axiomatic structure is de facto a criticism\non the axiomatic structure of RQM Despite the above abstract axiomatic identity, one should keep in mind\nthat, as illustrated in Eq s (3 1), RHM and RQM are physically inequivalent\nbecause the former is a nonunitary image of the latter Moreover, isotopies\nimply the following mapping of eigenvalues\n\n\n20\n\n\nH × |ψ⟩ = E 0 × |ψ⟩→ H × T × |ψ⟩ = E × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩, E ̸= E 0, (3 11)\n\n\naccording to which the same operator H has different eigenvalues in RQM\nand RHM, and this illustrates the nontriviality of the isotopies ### 3 3 Isolinearity, isolocality, isounitarity\n\n\nIt is important to see that, despite their physical inequivalence, RHM preserves the conventional linearity, locality and unitarity of RQM To begin,\nRHM is highly nonlinear in the weavefunctions (and their derivatives), as\nevident from isoeigenvalues expressions (3",
    "To begin,\nRHM is highly nonlinear in the weavefunctions (and their derivatives), as\nevident from isoeigenvalues expressions (3 9) Yet, the theory is isolinear,\ni e , it verifies the linearity conditions in isospace, e , it verifies the linearity conditions in isospace, e g , for all possible ˆa ∈ R [ˆ]\nor C [ˆ] and |φ [ˆ] ⟩, |ψ [ˆ] ⟩∈ H [ˆ], we have the identity\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ\nA×(ˆa×| ˆψ⟩ + ˆb×|φ⟩) = ˆa×A ˆ×| ˆψ⟩ + ˆb×A ˆ×|φ⟩, (3 12)\n\n\nA similar situation occurs for locality In fact, RHM is nonlocal-integral\nbecause interactions of that type are admitted in the Γ’s terms of the isounits, [ˆ]\nEq s (3 3) Nevertheless, RHM is isolocal, i e , it verifies the condition of locality in isospace In particular, RHM is everywhere local-differential except\nat the isounit On more technical grounds, RHM is equipped with a new\ntopology called Tsagas-Sourlas integro-differential topology [7f] By recalling that RQM is strictly local-differential, the above new topology has fundamental physical relevance inasmuch as it permits mathematically rigorous quantitative studies of the nonlocal-integral component of the\nnuclear force needed to represent the overlapping of the hyperdense charge\ndistributions of nucleons in the nuclear structure [5f] Next, RQM is said to be unitary in the sense that the only allowed transformations are of the unitary type, U × U [†] = U [†] × U = I By comparison,\nRHM is nonunitary because its transformation theory is based on the requirement W × W [†] = I [ˆ] ̸= I Nevertheless, RHM reconstructs unitarity\nin isospace, a property called isounitarity In fact, the above nonunitary\ntransforms cal be rewritten in the following identical isotopic form\n\n\nW = W [ˆ] × T [ˆ] [1][/][2], W × W [†] = I [ˆ] ̸= I, (3 13a)\n\n\n21\n\n\nW × W [†] ≡ W [ˆ] × [ˆ] W [ˆ] [†] = W [ˆ] [†] [ ˆ] ×W [ˆ] = I, [ˆ] (3 13b)\n\n\nThe necessity of the preceding reformulation is soon established by the\nfact that,even though derived via nonunitarity transforms, the isotopic structures (3 1) and related properties are not invariant under additional nonunitary transforms However, the needed form-invariance is readily achieved\nunder the isounitary reformulation (3 13) for which\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ\nI → I = ˆW ˆ×I ˆ×W ˆ [†] = ˆW × ˆT × ˆT [−][1] × ˆT × ˆW [†] ≡ I, (3 14a)\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ\nA× ˆB → W ˆ×A ˆ× ˆB ˆ×W ˆ [†] = ˆA [′] × ˆB [′],\n\nˆ ˆ\nK [′] = ˆW ˆ×K ˆ ˆ× ˆW [†], Kv = ˆA < ˆB, (3 14b)\n\n\nwith a corresponding invariance of the condition of isohermiticity and all\nother properties [6k] This illustrates again that the lack of application of the\nisotopies to any aspect of RQM implies insidious axiomatic inconsistencies Note that under isotransforms (3 14) the isounit and isotopic element\nremain numerically invariant Note also that the transformation theory of\nRQM is restricted to transforms verifying the condition U × U [†] = I for a\nfixed I Similarly, the isotransforms of RHM are restricted to those verifying\nthe condition W [ˆ] × [ˆ] W [ˆ] [†] = I [ˆ], this time, for fixed I [ˆ] (because its change would\nimply the description of a different system)",
    "Similarly, the isotransforms of RHM are restricted to those verifying\nthe condition W [ˆ] × [ˆ] W [ˆ] [†] = I [ˆ], this time, for fixed I [ˆ] (because its change would\nimply the description of a different system) ### 3 4 Isotopic physical laws\n\n\nIn this paper we are presenting the simplest possible branch of RHM, that\nspecifically formulated for applications to nuclear physics via a diagonal,\nHermitean and positive isounit (3 2) 2) It is easy to see that the above branch\ndoes indeed preserve all conventional QM laws Recall that generalizations of RQM which are conventionally nonlinear\nin the wavefunctions, i Recall that generalizations of RQM which are conventionally nonlinear\nin the wavefunctions, i e of the type H(x, p, ψ, ) × ψ = E × ψ [8] imply\nthe loss of the superposition principle, with consequential inapplicability to\na consistent treatment of composite systems such as nuclei, besides having\nadditional problematic aspects studied in [6k,9] RHM is also highly nonlinear in view of the eigenvalue structure (3 9),\ni e , H(x, p) × T [ˆ] ( ψ, [ˆ] ) × ψ [ˆ] = E × ψ [ˆ] However, the mathematical notion of\n\n\n22\n\n\nisolinearity has the important physical implication that RHM preserves the\nsuperposition principle in isospace, as one can verify This has the important implication that RHM can indeed be consistently applied to composite\nsystems such as few-body nuclei Moreover, conventional nonlinear systems can be identically reformulated\nin the isotopic form, H(t, r, ψ) × ψ ≡ H 0 (t, r) × T [ˆ] (ψ, )⟩ψ = E × ψ, by\ntherefore recovering axiomatic consistency in isospace Next, it is important to see that RHM preserves Heisenberg’s uncertainty\nprinciple In fact, from isocommutators (3 1d) we have (¯h = 1)\n\n\n\n∆ˆr [i] ∆ˆp j ≥ [1]\n\n\n\nj [ ] (3 15)\n2 [δ] [i]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\n2 [⟨][[ˆ][r] [i] [ˆ][,][p][ˆ] [j] []][⟩] [= 1] 2\n\n\n\nThis establishes that the deviations from Heisenberg’s uncertainties predicted\nby quantum deformations (e g , of the so-called squeezed states [4j]) can be\nremoved via their reformulation in an invariant isotopic form (see [6k] for\ndetails) Along similar lines, it is possible to prove that the notions of isolocality\nand isounitarity permit the preservation of causality under nonlocal-integral\nforces (see also [6k] for brevity) The preservation of the Fermi-Dirac statistics and related Pauli’s exlusion principle will be indicated shortly The proof\nof the preservation of other physical laws will be left to the interested reader The preservation of conventional laws can be seen from the fact that\nthe fundamental quantity of representing deviations from RQM, the isounit,\npreserves all axiomatic properties of the conventional unit I, it is the basic\ninvariant of the new theory and its isoexpectation values recover the conventional value I,\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ 1 ˆˆ ˆ ˆ\nI [n][ˆ] = ˆI ˆ×I ˆ× ˆ×I ≡ I, I 2 = I, [ˆ] I/I ≡ I, etc (3 16a)\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ\nI [′] = ˆW ˆ×I ˆ×W ˆ

establishes the occurrence with far reaching implications according to which the validity of conventional QM laws for the\n\n\n23\n\n\nnuclear structure, such as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Pauli’s exclusion principle, etc , by no means, imply that the conventional formulation\nof RQM is the only applicable discipline because exactly the same laws are\nadmitted by the structurally more general RHM It should be indicated for completeness that in this paper we are studying\nthe simplest possible realization of RHM, that specifically constructed for\nthe nuclear structure under the condition of preserving conventional physical\nlaws More general realizations exist [6k,6l], e g , those still of isotopic type\nwith nondiagonal isounit I [ˆ], or the more general ones of genotopic type with\nnonhermitean basic unit and related transforms\n\n\nI → I [ˆ] = U × I × W [†] = ̸ I [ˆ] [†], U × U ̸= I, W × W [†] ≠ I, (3 17)\n\n\nwhich are particularly suited to represent irreversibility under open-nonconservative conditions, or those of hyperstructural type where I [ˆ] is a set of\nnonhermitean elements, which are particularly suited to represent irreversible\nbiological systems [6k], for which conventional QM laws are not necessarily\npreserved The formulation of RHM presented in this section is intended to describe\nnucleons when members of a nuclear structure with conventional spin verifying conventional laws and merely having a nonspherical-deformable shape The more general formulations indicated above are intended for more general physical conditions, such as a neutron in the core of a collapsing star\nconsidered as external, and will not be considered in this paper ### 3 5 Isotopic realization of “hidden variables” and EPR “completion” of RQM\n\n\nThe reader should be aware that RHM provides an explicit and concrete realization of the theory of “hidden variables” [10a], which are actually realized\n\nˆ\nvia the operator λ = T [ˆ] (x, ˙x,, ∂ψ, ) and isoeigenvalues\n\n\nˆ\nH ˆ× λ | ˆψ⟩ = ˆH × λ(x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, ) × | ˆψ⟩ = E λ × | ˆψ⟩ (3 18)\n\n\nIn fact, the right modular actions “H × ψ” and “H× [ˆ] ψ” lose any distinction\nat the abstract level and, in this sense, they are evidently “hidden” in the\nconventional realization 24\n\n\nAs a result, RHM constitutes a form of “completion” of RQM, hereon\ncalled ”isotopic completion”, which results to be much along the celebrated\nargument by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [10b] In particular, the completion is permitted by the fact that von Neumann’s theorem [10c] and Bell’s\ninequalities [10d] are inapplicable (and not ”violated”) for the isotopic completion due to its nonunitary structure More specifically, von Neumann theorem is inapplicable because

    "g , in water, leads to inconsistencies, such as:\nthe assumption of the speed of light c = c 0 /n 4 in water as the maximal causal\nspeed implies the violation of the principle of causality because electrons can\ntravel in water faster than the speed of light (Cerenkov light); the assumption of the speed of light c 0 in vacuum as the maximal causal speed in water\nto salvage the principle of causality implies the violation of the relativistic\naddition of speeds for which the sum of two speeds of light in water does not\nyield the speed of light; and other inconsistencies [6k] Moreover, the special relativity is also known not to be applicable for\nthe description of deformations, as needed for the historical hypothesis of\nFig 1, and can characterize only linear, local-differential and Hamiltonianunitary systems, while a primary objective of these studies is a quantitative\ntreatment of the nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary component expected in\nthe nuclear force The isospecial relativity was proposed by Santilli [6e,6g,6k] for: the forminvariant description of arbitrary speeds c = c 0 /n 4 ; the characterization of\nextended-deformable shapes of particles; and the form-invariant description\nof nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary interactions The isospecial relativity\nis characterized by the axioms of the conventional formulation merely realized\nin isominkowski space M [ˆ] over R [ˆ] under the iso-Poincar´e invariance P [ˆ] (3 The isospecial relativity\nis characterized by the axioms of the conventional formulation merely realized\nin isominkowski space M [ˆ] over R [ˆ] under the iso-Poincar´e invariance P [ˆ] (3 1)",

    "47) One of the first implications of the isospecial relativity is that of permitting the representation of locally varying speeds of light via the conventional, abstract axioms of the special relativity [6e,6g] This is achieved via\nthe reconstruction of c 0 as the unique and universal maximal causal speed\nin isospace, while its projection in our space-time can assume any possible\nspeed In fact, jointly with the change c 0 → c 0 /n 4 the unit changes by the inverse amount 1 → n 4, thus preserving the original value c 0 In this way c 0 is a\n“universal constant” only in isospace M [ˆ], while its projection in conventional\nspace-time acquires the local form c 0 /n 4 The compatibility of the isospecial relativity with deformable shapes (indicated from the title of the first proposal [6e]) is evident from the unrestricted character of the functional dependence of the isounit The nonlinear,\nnonlocal and nonunitary characters are equally evident from the structure of\nthe iso-Poincar´e symmetry Intriguingly, we can say that the special relativity is universally applicable\nonly in isospace over isofields, because only in this latter case we have one\nsingle unique and universal causal speeds c 0, all possible deformed light cones\nare reduced to the perfect cone in isospace, and nonlinear, nonlocal and\nnonunitary interactions are identically rewritten in their isolinear, isolocal\nand isounitary form ### 3 12 Isotopic dynamical equations\n\n\nThe fundamental isorelativistic equations are uniquely identified by the isoPoincar´e symmetry via its iso-Casimir invariants (3 40) and related isorepresentation theory which we cannot possibly study here for brevity (see ref [6k] for initial studies) The basic equation is the second-order isorelativistic equation which is given by the isoinvariant (3 40b) implemented with\nthe conventional minimal coupling rule to an external electromagnetic field\n\n\n41\n\n\nwith four-potential A [ˆ] µ (x), and realized in terms of the isodifferential calculus\n(3 21)\n\n\nˆ2 ˆ\n{[ˆp µ + i × e × A [ˆ] µ ]× [ˆ] [ˆp [µ] + i × e × A [ˆ] [µ] ] + ˆm }×| ˆψ⟩ =\n\n\nˆ\n= {η [µν] × [ˆp µ + i × e × A [ˆ] µ ] × T [ˆ] × [ˆp µ + i × e × A [ˆ] ν ] + (m × m) × I [ˆ] ] × T [ˆ] × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ =\n\n\nˆ\n= {η [µν] [−i∂ [ˆ] µ + i × e × A µ ] × [−i∂ [ˆ] ν + i × e × A ν ] + m [2] } × |ψ [ˆ] ⟩ =\n\n\n= {I [ˆ] [µ] α [η][ˆ] [αν] [[][−][i][T][ ˆ] µ [ γ] [×] [∂] [γ] [+] [i] [×] [e] [×] [A] [µ] []] [×] [[][−][i][T][ ˆ] ν [ δ] [×] [∂] [δ] [+] [i] [×] [e] [×] [A] [ν] []+] [m] [2] [}×|][ ˆ][ψ][⟩] [= 0] [ ] (3 50)\nA solution for the case of null external field and isounits averaged to\nconstant diagonal elements n µ [2] is given by the isoplane wave (c 0 = 1)\n\n\nψ(x) = e [i][I][ˆ] [µ] ν [×][p] µ [×][x] [ν], (3 51)\n\n\nwhich does reproduce isoinvariant (3 40b) for constant p’s and n’s For completeness, we quote here the nonrelativistic equations [6k,6l]\n\n\ni∂ [ˆ] t ψ [ˆ] = iT [ˆ] t ∂ t ψ [ˆ] = H [ˆ] × [ˆ] s ψ [ˆ] = H [ˆ] × T [ˆ] s × ψ [ˆ] =\n\n\n= E [ˆ] × [ˆ] s ψ [ˆ] = (E × I [ˆ] s ) × T [ˆ] s × ψ [ˆ] = E × ψ, [ˆ] (3 52a)\n\n\nψˆ(t, r) = {eˆ [iH][×][t] }×ˆ s ψ(0, r) = {e [i][ ˆ] H×T [ˆ] s ×t } × ψ(0, r), (3 52b)\n\n\nid [ˆ] A/ [ˆ] dt [ˆ] = iI [ˆ] t dA/dt [ˆ] = A [ˆ] × [ˆ] s H [ˆ] − H [ˆ] × [ˆ] s A [ˆ] = A [ˆ] × T [ˆ] s × H [ˆ] − H [ˆ] × T [ˆ] s × A, [ˆ] (3 52c)\n\n\nAˆ(t) = {eˆ [i][×][ ˆ] H×t }×ˆ s ˆA(0)ˆ× s {eˆ it×H [ˆ] } = {e iH [ˆ] ×T [ˆ] s ×t }× ˆA(0)×{e it×T [ˆ] s ×H [ˆ] }, (3 52d)\n\n\n42\n\n\npˆ× [ˆ] s ψ [ˆ] = ˆp × T [ˆ] s × ψ [ˆ] = −i∇ [ˆ] k ψ [ˆ] = −iT [ˆ] k [i] [∇] [i] [ ˆ][ψ,] (3 52d)\n\n\n[ˆp i ˆ,rˆ [j] ] = ˆp i × [ˆ] s rˆ [j] − rˆ [j] [ ˆ] × s pˆ i = −iδ ij I, [ˆp i ˆ,pˆ j ] = [ˆr [i] ˆ,rˆ [j] ] ≡ 0, (3 52e)\n\n\nIˆ i = ˆI t (t, r ˆψ, ) = n 42 × ˆΓ t (t, r, ˆψ, ) = ˆT t −1 ⟩0, (3 52f )\n\n\nTˆ s = ˆT s (t, r, ˆψ, ) = diag(n 12, n 22, n 32 ) × ˆΓ s (t, r, ˆψ, )⟩0 = ˆI −s 1 (3 52g)\n\n\nwith isoplane-wave solution\n\n\nˆ\nk [×][n] k [2] [×][r] k [−][E][×][n] [42] [×][t][)]\nψ(t, r) = e [i][×][(][p], (3 53)\n\n\nwhich coincides with (3 51) as in the conventional case",
    "51) as in the conventional case One should note the compatibility of the relativistic and nonrelativistic\nequations, the “decoupling” in the latter of the isounit into i8s space and\ntime components, as well as the isounitary structure of the time evolution\nin finite form The proof that the above dynamical equations are indeed\nform-invariant under their respective relativistic and nonrelativistic isounitary symmetries is an instructive exercise for the interested reader ## 4 Exact representation of nuclear magnetic moments\n\n\nOnce the new formalism of RHM is known, the exact representation of the\ntotal magnetic moments of few-body nuclei becomes straightforward Its\nsimplicity and exact character should then be compared with the truly complex calculations of ref [2] via the conventional relativistic/Bethe-Salpeter\ntheories and its lack of exact character The most effective derivation is that via the iso-Dirac equation, i e , the\nisotopies of the conventional Dirac equation [14a] originating from the linearization of the second-order isorelativistic equation (3 , the\nisotopies of the conventional Dirac equation [14a] originating from the linearization of the second-order isorelativistic equation (3 50) 50) This linearization has been studied by a number of authors (see [6k], Ch 10, for details\n\n\n43\n\n\nand references), although in its general form it implies a mutation of sp6in\nwhich, quite intriguingly, was first discovered by Dirac himself [14b,14c], although without his knowledge of the essential isotopic structure of his own\ngeneralized equation [6k] In this paper we have to re-inspect the derivation of the iso-Dirac equation and introduce a new form specifically intended to represent the mutation\nof the intrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons while preserving their angular\nmomentum and spin, as necessary for a study of the historical hypothesis\n(Sect 1) For other generalizations representing the (constant, yet) anomalous magnetic moments of nucleons one may inspect ref [14d] and papers\nquoted therein The linearization of second-order isoinvariant (3 40b) requires a composite\nisounit characterized by the tensorial product of two nonunitary transforms,\none acting in the orbital component and on in the spin part, resulting in the\n8-dimensional total isounit,\n\n\n(U [orb] ⊗ U [spin] ) × (U [orb] ⊗ U [spin] ) [†] = I [ˆ] [tot] =\n\n\n= I [ˆ] [orb] ⊗ I [ˆ] [spin] = ( T [ˆ] [orb] ) [−][1] ⊗ ( T [ˆ] [spin] ) [−][1] ⟩0 (4 1a)\n\n\nˆ 2 2 2 2\nI [orb] = diag (n 1, n 2, n 3, n 4 ), n µ ̸= 0, (4 1b)\n\n\nIˆ [spin] = diag (m 12, m 22, −m 12, −m 22 ), n µ ̸= 0, (4 1b)\n\n\n\n0 W 2×2\nU [spin] =\n� W [†] 2×2 0\n\n\n\n0 W [†] 2×2\n�, U [†][spin] = � W 2×2 0\n\n\n\n, (4 1c)\n�\n\n\n\nW 2×2 = 0 m 1\n� m 2 0\n\n\n\n, W [†] 2×2 [=] 0 m 2\n� � m 1 0\n\n\n\n, (4 1d)\n�\n\n\n\nˆ m 12 0\nI [spin] 2×2 [=][ W] [2][×][2] [×][ W] [ †] 2×2 [=]\n� 0 m 2 [2]\n\n\n\n,\n�\n\n\n\nTˆ [spin] 2×2 [=] m 1−2 0\n� 0 m 2 [−][2]\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n, (4 1e)\n�\n\n\nˆ −m 12 0\nI [d][ spin] 2×2 [=][ −][I][ˆ] [†][spin] 2×2 [=][ −][W] [ †] 2×2 [×][ W] 2×2 [=] � 0 −m 2 [2]\n\n\n\n,\n�\n\n\n\nTˆ [d][ spin] 2×2 [=] � −m0 1−2 −m0 2 [−][2] (4 1f )\n�\n\n\n\nThe linearization of Eq s (3 50) can then be written\n\n\n(ˆη [ρσ] × ˆp ρ × [ˆ] pˆ ν + ˆm [2] )× [ˆ] ψ [ˆ] = (4 2)\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ\n= (ˆη [µν] ×γ µ ×T [ˆ] [spin] ×p ν ×T [ˆ] [orb] −i×m)×T [ˆ] [tot] (ˆη [αβ] ×γ α ×T [ˆ] [spin] ×p β ×T [ˆ] [orb] +i×m)×ψ =\n\n\n= [ˆη [µν] × ˆη [αβ] × [1]\n\n2 [×][ (ˆ][γ] [µ] [ ×][ ˆ][T] [ spin] [ ×][ ˆ][γ] [α] [ ×][ ˆ][T] [ spin] [+]\n\n\n+ˆγ α × T [ˆ] [spin] × ˆγ µ × T [ˆ] [spin] ) × ˆp ν × T [ˆ] [orb] × ˆp β × T [ˆ] [orb] + m × m] × ψ [ˆ] = 0,\n\n\nresulting in the following form of the iso-Dirac equation (apparently introduced here for the first time)\n\n\nspin ˆ 2 orb ˆ\n(ˆη [µν] × ˆγ µ × [ˆ] p ν − i × ˆm )ˆ× ψ =\n\n\n= (ˆη [µν] × ˆγ µ × T [ˆ] [spin] × ˆp ν × T [ˆ] [orb] − i × m × m) × ψ [ˆ] = 0 (4 3)\n\n\nThe isogamma matrices defined by\n\n\n{γˆ µ ˆ,γˆ α } = ˆγ µ × T [ˆ] [spin] × ˆγ α × T [ˆ] [spin] + ˆγ α × T [ˆ] [spin] × ˆγ µ × T [ˆ] [spin] = 2ˆη µν, (4 4)\n\n\nand admit the explicit realization\n\n\nˆ orb\nγ µ = ( T [ˆ] µµ ) [1][/][2] × U [spin] × γ µ × U [†][spin] × I [ˆ] [spin], (4 5a)\n\n\n\nˆ\nˆ orb 1/2 0 σ k\nγ k = ( T [ˆ] kk ) [1][/][2] × γ k × I [ˆ] [spin] = T [ˆ] kk × ˆ\n� σ [d] k 0\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n× I [ˆ] [spin], (4 5b)\n�\n\n\nγˆ 4 = ( T [ˆ] 44orb ) [1][/][2] ×γ 4 ×I [ˆ] [spin] = ( T [ˆ] kkorb ) [1][/][2] × � I spin2 0 ×2 Iˆ [d][ spin] 0 2×2\n\n\n\n×I [ˆ] [spin], (4 5c)\n�\n\n\n\nσˆ k = W × σ k × W [†], σˆ [d] k [=][ −][σ][ˆ] [†] k [=][ −][W] [ †] [ ×][ σ] [k] [ ×][ W ] (4 5d)\n\n\nwith a simple extension to the minimal coupling rule hereon tacitly implied The nontriviality of the isotopy is then established by the fact that the\nisotopic elements T [ˆ] µµ enter into the structure of the isotopic gamma matrices As one can see, the conventional Dirac equations is defined on conventional Minkowski space with basic unit I = diag ({1, 1, 1}, 1), thus characterizes the perfect and rigid sphere {1, 1, 1} mowing in vacuum, n 4 = 1 The\nabove isodirac equation represents instead all infinitely possible ellipsoidical\ndeformations of the perfect sphere with semiaxes n 1 [2], n 2 [2], n 3 [2] under the\nvolume preserving condition (2 1), n 1 [2] × n 2 [2] × n 3 [2] = 1, while propagating\nwithin a physical media with index of refraction n 4 ̸= 1",

a meanlife of the order of 15 minutes when in vacuum; a meanlife\nof the order of days, weeks and years when belonging to other nuclei; all the\nway to an infinite meanlife for stable nuclei Once the above occurrences are admitted, the basic principle for possible\nnew recycling of nuclear waste is the “stimulated neutron decay” (SND)\nconsisting of resonating or other subnuclear mechanisms suitable to stimulate\nits beta decay Among the various possibilities under study, we quote here\nthe possible gamma stimulated neutron decay (GSND) according to the\nreaction [25a]\n\n\nγ + n → p [+] + e [−] + ¯ν, (5 1)\n\n\nwhich is predicted by RQM to have a very small (and therefore practically\ninsignificant) cross section as a function of the energy, but which is instead\npredicted by RHM to have a resonating peak in the cross section at the value\nof 1 294 MeV (corresponding to 3 129 × 10 [20] Hz) As such, the above mechanism is of subnuclear character, in the sense of occurring in the structure\nof the neutron, rather than in the nuclear structure, the latter merely implying possible refinements of the resonating frequency due to the (relatively\nsmaller) nuclear binding energy [7b] When stable elements are considered, the above GSND is admitted only\nin certain instances, evidently when the transition is compatible with all\nconventional laws This is the case for the isotope Mo(100,42) which, under\nthe GSND, would transform via beta emission into the Te(100,43) which, in\nturn, is naturally unstable and beta decays into Ru(100,44) For a number\nof additional admissible elements see [25a] The point important for this note is that the GSND is predicted to be\nadmissible for large and unstable nuclei as occurring in the nuclear waste The possible new form of recycling submitted for study in this note is given\nby bombarding the radioactive waste with a beam of photons of the needed\nexcitation frequency and of the maximal possible intensity Such a beam\nwould cause an instantaneous excess of peripheral protons in the waste nuclei with their consequential decay due to instantaneous excess of Coulomb\nrepulsive forces It should be stressed that this note can only address the basic principle\nof the GSND Once experimentally established (see later on), the recycling\nrequires evident additional technological studies on the equipment suitable\n\n\n53\n\n\nto produce the photon beam in the desired frequency and intensity, e",
    "Once experimentally established (see later on), the recycling\nrequires evident additional technological studies on the equipment suitable\n\n\n53\n\n\nto produce the photon beam in the desired frequency and intensity, e g , via\nsynchrotron radiation or other mechanisms [25c] The imporatant point is that equipment of the above nature is expected to\nbe definitely smaller in size, weight and cost than large particle accelerators As such, the recycling is expected to verify the basic requirement of usability\nby the nuclear power companies in their own plants A novelty of the proposed new recycling is that it is specifically conceived\nto occur at the subnuclear level A virtually endless number of possibilities\nexist for the reduction of the meanlife of the waste via mechanisms of nuclear\n\ntype Among them we note mechanisms based on RQM, such as those by\nShaffer et al [26a], Marriot et al [26b], Barker [26c] and others, as well as\nnew nuclear mechanisms predicted by RHM and currently under patenting The understanding is that, to maximize the efficiency, the final equipment is\nexpected to be a combination various means of both subnuclear and nuclear\ncharacter ## 6 Possible additional advances\n\n\nThe possible experimental verification of the alterability of the magnetic moment and meanlife of the neutron would rather deep implications throughout\nall aspects of nuclear physics In addition to possible new forms of recycling\nnuclear waste indicated above, it may be of some value to indicate the following additional, possibilities 1) Nuclear forces RHM terminates the study of nuclear forces by\nadding terms and terms in the Hamiltonian, because it provides means for\nrigorous new studies based on the representation with potentials of terms\ntruly being of action-at-a-distance, and the representation with the isounit\nof contact, nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary effects for which the notion\nof a potential has no conceptual, mathematical or physical meaning of any\nnature;\n\n\n2) Nuclear structure RHM permits a deeper understanding of the\nnuclear structure via the admission of small, yet significant interactions\nof nonlocal-integral and nonhamiltonian-nonunitary type, due to the waveoverlapping of the constituents In turn, it can be safely stated that the\ninclusion of the latter interactions will inevitably lead to new nuclear mod\n\n54\n\n\nels New nuclear reactions cannot also be excluded in view of the attractive\n\ncharacter of the latter interactions under certain rather selective but well\nidentified conditions even against the Coulomb barrier, as theoretically and\nexperimentally established in [23] 3) Controlled fusion One of the first applications of the studies of this\npaper is expected for the attempts at reaching a “hot controlled fusion” with\na positive energy balance In fact, these attempts are essentially costituted\nby a condensation phase caused by magnetic or other means which works as\npredicted, followed by the initiation of the fusion process with its notorious\ninstabilities which have not been controlled to date It is evident that RQM is exactly valid for the condensation phase due\nto large mutual distances However, the exact validity of the same discipline\nat the initiation of the fusion process does not appear to have solid scientific\ngrounds because of the emergence of numerous new effects at short distances,\nsuch as those of nonlinear, nonlocal and nonpotential type, which are beyond\nany hope of quantitative treatment via RQM In view of evident societal\naspects, deeper studies with a covering disciplines appear, therefore, to be\nwarranted",
    "In view of evident societal\naspects, deeper studies with a covering disciplines appear, therefore, to be\nwarranted In particular, the studies of this paper suggest that the intrinsic magnetic moments of protons and neutrons is expected to change precisely at\nthe initiation of the fusion process It is then evident, although not widely\nadmitted, that such a change has implications for the currently uncontrolled\ninstabilities, and should be reflected in a re-design of the magnetic and other\nconfinement After all, the control of the instabilities is currently conducted\nunder the (tacit) assumption that protons and neutrons preserve their intrinsic magnetic process during the fusion process 4) New subnuclear energy Any new recycling of nuclear waste is\nunavoidably linked to possible new sources of energy In fact, the GSND\n\n\nγ res + Mo(100, 42) → stim Tc(100, 43) + β → spont Ru(100, 44) + β, (6 1)\n\n\nis de facto a potential new source of subnuclear energy called hadronic energy\n\n[25a] (see also the review [25b]) which releases the rather large amount of\nabout 5 MeV plus the energy would not release harmful radiations, would\nnot imply radioactive waste, would not require heavy shield or critical mass,\nand would be realizable in large or minuterized forms 55\n\n\n5) Other possible applications Numerous additional applications are\nconceivable, such as the production of rare isotopes via GSNT, the prediction\nof neutron rays for industrial applications via the synthesis of the neutron\nfrom protons and electrons beams in flight, medical applications, and others ## 7 Proposed experiments\n\n\nThe continuation of quantitative scientific studies on the proposed new recycling of the nuclear waste (as well as on the other applications indicated\nabove) beyond the level of personal views one way or another, requires the\nfollowing three basic experiments, all of truly fundamental character, moderate cost and full realization with current technology",
    "## 7 Proposed experiments\n\n\nThe continuation of quantitative scientific studies on the proposed new recycling of the nuclear waste (as well as on the other applications indicated\nabove) beyond the level of personal views one way or another, requires the\nfollowing three basic experiments, all of truly fundamental character, moderate cost and full realization with current technology I Finalize the interferometric 4π spinorial symmetry measures\n\n[3] The above measures are manifestly fundamental for possible new forms\nof recycling as well as for possible new forms of subnuclear energy In fact,\nthey would provide experimental evidence on possible deviations from the\nPoincar´e symmetry in favor of our covering isopoincar´e form This is due to\nthe fact that, if confirmed, the measures would establish a deviation from the\nfundamental spinorial transformation law in favor of the mutated form (4 8) The alterability of the meanlife of the neutron would then be consequential It should be stressed that the primary evidence for the alterability of the\nintrinsic magnetic moments of nucleons rests in the experimental values of\ntotal nuclear magnetic moments The finalization of interferometric measures\n\n[3] would merely provide additional backing on the same alterability The\nlatter would however occur for controllable conditions, thus being invaluable\nfor other predictions via extrapolations II II Repeat don Borghi’s experiment [25d] on the apparent synthesis of the neutron from protons and electrons only Despite momentous advances, we still miss fundamental experimental knowledge on the\nstructure of the neutron, e Despite momentous advances, we still miss fundamental experimental knowledge on the\nstructure of the neutron, e g",

    "294 MeV The latter experiment has been recently initiated by N Tsagas and his\nassociates [25e] It consists of disk of the radioisotope Eu [152] (which naturally\nemits gammas of 1 3 MeV) placed parallel and close to a disk of an element\nadmitting of the GSND, such as the Mo(100, 42) (or a sample of nuclear\nwaste) The detection of electrons with at least 2 MeV emanating from the\nsystem would establish the principle of the GSND (because such electrons\ncan only be of subnuclear origin, Compton electrons being of at most 1\nMeV) The detection via mass spectrography of traces of the extremely rare\nRu(100,44) after sufficient running time would confirm said principle beyond\nany reasonable doubt The practical realization of the proposed form of waste\nrecycling would then be shifted to the industrial development and production\nof a photon beam of the needed frequency and intensity via a relatively small\nequipment usable by the nuclear power companies in their own plants ## References\n\n\n[1] J M Blatt and V F Weisskopf, Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Wiley &\nSons, New York (1966) [2] S G Bondarenko, V V Burov, M Beyer and S M Dorkin, “Magnetic\nmoment of the deuteron as a problem of relativistic corrections”, JINR\nCommunication E4-95-440 (1995), Dubna, Russia [3] H Rauch et al , Phys Lett Lett A 54, 425 (1975) [3a]; G Badurek et al ,\nPhys Rev D 14, 1177 (1976) [3b]; H Rauch et al , Z Physik B 29,\n281 (1978) [3c]; H Kaiser et al , Z Physik A 291, 231 (1979) [3d]; H Rauch et al , Hadronic J 4, 1280 (1981) [3e]; A Werner et al , Phys Rev Lett 35, 1053 (1975) [3f] [4] A Albert, Trans Amer Math Soc 64, 552 (1948) [4a]; R M Santilli,\nNuovo Cimento 51, 570 (1967) [4b]; G Eder, Hadronic J 4, 541 (1981)\n\n[4c] and 5, 750 (1982) [4d]; R M Santilli, Hadronic J 4, 1166 (1981)\n\n[4e]; C N Ktorides, H C Myung and R M Santilli, Phys Rev D 22,\n\n\n58\n\n\n892 (1980) [4f]; L C Biedenharn, J Phys A 22, L873 (1989) [4g]; A J Macfarlane, J Phys A 22, L4581 (1989) [4h]; A N Sissakian, G S Pogosyan and S I Vinitsky, eds , Symmetry Methods in Physics, JINR,\nDubna, Russia (1994) [4i]; T L Curtis, B Fairlie and Z K Zachos, eds ,\nQuantum Groups, World Scientific, Singapore (1991) [4j]; A Nowiski\nand H Ruegg, Phys Lett B 293, 344 (1992) [4k]; A Jannussis et\nal , Nuovo Cimento 103B, 17 and 537 (1989); 104B, 33 and 53 (1989;\n108B, 57 (1993) [4l]; J Modern Optics 39, 771 and 1067 (1992); 40,\n441, 1351 and 1369 (1993); Phys Lett A 181, 341 (1993) [4m] [5] D F Lopez, in Symmetry Methods in Physics, A N Sissakian, G S Pogosyan and S I Vinitsky, eds , JINR, Dubna, Russia (1994), p 300\n\n[5a]; Hadronic J 16, 429 (1993) [5b]; A Jannussis, R Mignani and R M Santilli, Ann Fond L de Broglie 18, 371 (1993) [5c]; A Jannussis and\nD Skaltsas, Ann Fond L de Broglie 18, 275 (1993) [5d] [6] R M Santilli, Hadronic J 1, 228 (1978) [6a]; and 1, 574 (1978) [6b];\nFoundations of Theoretical Mechanics, vol 1 (1978) [6c], vol 2 (1983)\n\n[6d], Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg-New York; Nuovo Cimento Lett 37,\n545 (1983) [6e]; Algebras, Groups and Geometries 10, 273 (1993) [6f];\nJ Moscow Phys Soc 3, 225 (1993) [6g]; JINR Rapid Comm 6, 24\n(1993) [6h]; Chinese J Syst Eng & Electr",
