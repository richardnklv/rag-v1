after only\n1 56 × 10 [13] p/cm [2] this has reduced to 160V The value remains unchanged with higher fluence For an applied\nbias greater than V fd the signal created by irradiating the ohmic contact with an alpha source (the hole signal)\nis non-zero, implying that the detector is active across the entire bulk As the value of V fd is reduced with\nfluence the extension of the high field region in the detector changes after irradiation The value of the reverse\ncurrent for biases greater than V fd reduces with increased fluence and the reverse current characteristic becomes\nmore resistive in nature Although the reverse current at V fd increases with dose up to 1 × 10 [14] p/cm [2], the\nmajority of the increase occurs by 3 × 10 [13] p/cm [2] From 1 × 10 [14] p/cm [2] up to 2 4 × 10 [14] p/cm [2] (the maximum\nfluence tested with this sample) the current at this bias remains approximately constant (see figure 2) Reverse current characteristics of two detectors of different thickness, 160µm and 500µm, both of which were\nirradiated to 6 × 10 [13] p/cm [2] are shown in figure 3 It can be seen that the value of the leakage current up to\nV fd is independent of the detector thickness This is not the case in silicon where the leakage current, I r, has\na dependence on fluence, Φ, given by [6]\n∆I r (1)\nV ol [=][ α][Φ]\n\n\nwhere α is the reverse current damage constant and Vol is the volume of the detector No varriation in this\neffect on the leakage current has been observed for detectors that were biased during irradiation The forward current characteristics also change with increasing fluence The effect of protons on a 160µm\nthick detector, shown in figure 4, illustrates this A plateau appears that extends to higher bias values with\nincreasing fluence while the magnitude of the plateau current falls This allows the detector to be operated\nunder forward bias ### 4 Charge collection efficiency\n\n\nThe charge collection efficiencies for 200µm thick detectors as a function of neutron, proton and pion fluence\nare shown in figures 5, 6 and 7 These were measured using minimum ionising particles (mips) from a [90] Sr\n\n\n#### **0** **-1E-07** **-2E-07** **-3E-07** **-4E-07** **-5E-07** **-6E-07**\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n\n\n#### **-200 -100 0** **Bias (V)** **Fluence 1E13/cm2**\n\n**1 5 6** **3 8 8** **8 9** **PRE**\n\n\nFigure 1: The reverse current characteristics of a 210µm thick GaAs detector with increasing 24GeV/c proton\nfluence, measured at 20 [o] C\n\n\n## **35** **30** **25** **20** **15** **10** **5** **0**\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n||||||||||\n\n\n## **0 5 10 15 20 25 30** **Fluence {10 [1 3] p / c m [2] }**\n\nFigure 2: The reverse current of a 160µm thick GaAs detector as a function of fluence of 24GeV/c protons,\nmeasured at 20 [o] C ### **0** **-1E-07** **-2E-07** **-3E-07** **-4E-07**\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||\n||||||\n\n\n### **-400 -300 -200 -100 0** **Bias (V)** 160 µ m (G120-7) 500 µ m (G114-7)\n\nFigure 3: The reverse current characteristics of two GaAs detectors after 6 × 10 [13] 24GeV/c protons/cm [2] **-2E-06**\n\n\n**-1 5E-06**\n\n\n**-1E-06**\n\n\n**-5E-07**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n\n\n\n**0** **-50** **-100** **-150** **-200** **-250**\n\n\n\n**Proton fluence {p/cm** **[2]** **}**\n\n\n**4 4 E 1 3**\n\n\n**6 0 E 1 3**\n\n\n\n**8 7 E 1 3**\n\n\n**1 1 E 1 4**\n\n\n\n**Bias (V)**\n\n\n**2 3 E 1 4**\n\n\n**2 7 E 1 4**\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The forward current characteristics of a 160µm thick GaAs detector with increasing 24GeV/c proton\nfluence, measured at 20 [o] C\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n**80**\n\n\n**60**\n\n\n**40**\n\n\n**20**\n\n\n\n**26600**\n\n\n**21280**\n\n\n**15960**\n\n\n**10640**\n\n\n**5320**\n\n\n\n**0**\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n\n**0** **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6**\n\n**Fluence {10** **[1 4]** **/ c m** **[2]** **}**\n\n\nFigure 5: The cce of 200µm thick GaAs detectors as a function of neutron fluence, measured at 200V and 20 [o] C source at an applied bias of 200V The reduction in cce with fluence occurs at a greater rate for pions and\nprotons than for neutrons A 10000 electron signal response to the [90] Sr source, (≈ 40% cce), is obtained after\n1 4 × 10 [14] n/cm [2], 6 0 × 10 [13] p/cm [2], and only 3 0 × 10 [13] π/cm [2]",
    "0 × 10 [13] π/cm [2] The cce falls rapidly initially and then at a\nslower rate for higher fluences with the position of the change in gradient depending upon the particle type In\nthe ATLAS experiment at the LHC a particle flux of 0 12 × 10 [14] π/cm [2] /year at the position of the GaAs wheels\nhas been calculated [7] for full luminosity This means that after only two years at full luminosity the pion\nfluence would be sufficient to reduce the signal from a 200µm thick detector to approximately 10000 electrons The neutron flux is the only other significant contribution and this has been calculated to be a factor of 3 to\n10 times less than the pions The exact value depends upon the moderator used in the calorimeters The exact value depends upon the moderator used in the calorimeters After the\n10 years expected operational lifetime of ATLAS the neutron fluence will not be enough to reduce the signal to\nless than 10000 electrons Irradiated 200µm thick detectors biased in excess of 200V demonstrate an increase in cce For example for\na 160µm thick detector irradiated to a fluence of 1 0 × 10 [14] p/cm [2] the signal increased from 8500 electrons at\n200V to 12000 electrons at 400V The reason for the increase in signal can be understood from the electron and\nhole collection data Before irradiation, the signal due to the holes is greater than that due to the electrons,\nimplying that the electrons are trapped more than the holes The signal due to the holes however falls at a faster\nrate with fluence than that due to the electrons This means that both electron and hole traps are introduced\nwith irradiation, while the electron trapping is the less important after irradiation contrary to what is observed\nin unirradiated detectors The electron signal, which is constant for a bias up to V fd, rises at greater applied\nbiases as shown in figure 8 The hole signal remains almost constant with increasing bias after its initial steep\nrise at V fd From this it is possible to conclude that field-enhanced electron detrapping may be present As the mip signal for a GaAs detector irradiated in excess of 1 0 × 10 [14] p/cm [2] appears to be independent\nof substrate thickness, even at an applied bias much larger than V fd, it is proposed that the carriers have a\nmean free path less than or equal to the thickness of the thinnest detector tested, that is 115µm The charge\ndeposited by a mip, Q dep is given by\n\n\n\nQ dep = [dE] (2)\n\ndx [W]\n\n\n\nwhere W is the width of the detector and dE/dx is the energy loss per unit length of detector traversed If the\ncarrier has a mean free path, λ, then the charge collected, Q col, is\n\n\nλ\nQ col = Q dep (3)\nW\n\n\nthus\nQ col\nλ =

period\nof time greater than 1 year The sample was stored at room temperature, which varied throughout the year\nfrom 18 [o] C to 25 [o] C All the current measurements were carried out at 20 [o] C with the same Keithley 237 voltage\nsource measurement unit The first current measurement was performed 20 days after the irradiation period\ndue to the initial activity of the sample and holder preventing earlier handling The value of the reverse current,\nI r, at V fd reduced with time (t), in hours, with a logarithmic dependence given by\n\n\nI r × 10 [7] = −0 063ln(t) + 2 4 (7)\n\n\nThe value of V fd remained constant over this period Some samples have shown an increase in cce over a similar\nperiod of annealing, however this represented at most an improvement of 8% of the initial cce Elevated temperature annealing, for periods ranging from 15 minutes to 33 hours, was performed on six\nirradiated detectors in an oven at 210 [o] C in air without bias The reverse current and charge collection efficiency\nvariations for a 180µm thick detector irradiated to 1 0 × 10 [14] p/cm [2] are shown in figures 9 and 10 The reverse\ncurrent decreased after an 33 hour anneal from 0 22µA to 0 14µA (corresponding to 30nA/mm [2] to 20nA/mm [2] )\nwhere the unirradiated value was 0 10µA (14nA/mm [2] ) The full depletion voltage remained unaffected by the\nannealing For an applied bias of 100V the cce increased from 23% to 30% for annealing times up to 5 hours As the bias increased, the increase in cce for the annealed detector was at a slower rate than in the pre-annealed\ncase, resulting in a lower cce for the annealed detectors at biases in excess of 400V For longer anneal times the\ncce decreased For an anneal time of 33 hours, for example, the cce was only 15% at 100V rising to 22% for a\nmaximum applied bias of 500V #### **0** **-1E-07** **-2E-07**

for 33 hours The arsenic antisite defect in GaAs is known to anneal at temperatures in excess of 450 [o] C [8] As the\nirradiation could produce such antisite defects the effect of annealing at 450 [o] C was investigated A flash-lamp\nanneal was used to illuminate the detectors for either 30,60,90, or 120 seconds The effect was shown to be\nindependent of the detector side which was illuminated, demonstrating that the whole bulk was being heated The plateau reverse leakage current was reduced but so was the full depletion voltage For an applied bias\ngreater than V fd the annealed current was greater than before annealing with the gradient of this section of\nthe current characteristic being quite large The mip cce of the detector was increased for applied biases less\nthan V fd, however due to the large increase in leakage current above V fd it was not always possible to measure\nthe charge collection at a higher applied bias The increase in mip cce was due to an increase in electron mean\nfree path with anneal time while the hole mean free path remained unchanged A bias of 300V, which could be\napplied to a detector annealed at 450 [o] C for 120s after a fluence of 1 7 × 10 [14] π/cm [2], gave a mip cce of 71% The pre-irradiation cce was 95% and the post-irradiation, pre-anneal value was 26% ### 6 Indium doped samples\n\n\nTwo detectors were fabricated with 500µm thick SI GaAs doped with indium [5] These were tested before and\nafter an exposure of 1 4 × 10 [14] 24GeV/c protons/cm [2] The reverse current of the detectors before irradiation\nwas 30nA/mm [2], less than for the 500µm thick SI-U GaAs detectors After the irradiation the value of V fd was\nreduced to only 220V, compared to 340V for the undoped sample The current at the applied bias of V fd was\n0 4µA (57nA/mm [2] ) which was higher than that of the undoped sample which was 0 22µA The charge collection\nefficiency for the indium doped samples was less that that of the undoped samples before irradiation by 20% After the irradiation the signal fell to 10% (6650 electrons) compared to 17% (11305 electrons), respectively,\nfor an applied bias of 1000V ### 7 Conclusions\n\n\nThe changes in reverse current and charge collection efficiency for SI-U GaAs detectors have been studied after\nirradiations with 1MeV neutrons, 24GeV/c protons and 300MeV/c pions While the leakage current

slight and pose little problem to the operation of the detectors, the fall in cce gives major cause for concern At a given high fluence, the reduction is greater for charged hadrons than for neutrons (this difference is\ndiscussed in detail in reference [9]) The cce falls rapidly in the first 3 × 10 [13] p(π)/cm [2] The reduction has\nbeen shown to be due to both electrons and holes being trapped, with the hole mean free path affected much\nmore dramatically For an applied bias greater than V fd the cce increases due to the increased signal from the\nelectrons Room temperature annealing has been identified in the reverse current characteristics and a slight\nimprovement has also been seen in the cce Annealing at elevated temperatures has shown beneficial effects in\nboth leakage current and cce The effect of proton irradiation on indium-doped GaAs detectors has shown the\nmaterial to be no more radiation-hard than SI-U GaAs Further tests on different samples should be performed Further tests on different samples should be performed ### 8 Acknowledgements\n\n\nThe authors would like to thank F McDevitt, A Meikle and F Doherty for technical support and all those at the\nISIS,
