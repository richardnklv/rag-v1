    "# Carbon Coated Gas Electron Multipliers\n\nS Beirle, U Werthenbach, G Zech, T Zeuner\nUniversit¨at Siegen, Germany\n\n\nJuly 1998\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nGas electron multipliers (GEMs) have been overcoated with a high\nresistivity 10 [14] −10 [15] Ω/□ amorphous carbon layer The coating avoids\ncharging up of the holes and provides a constant gain immediately\nafter switching on independent of the rate The gain uniformity across\nthe GEM is improved Coating opens the possibility to produce thick\nGEMs of very high gain ##### 1 Introduction\n\n\nThe gas electron multiplier (GEM) [1,2] has proven to be a very attractive\nnew device especially in combination with MSGCs Splitting the amplification in two steps allows to reduce the MSGC voltage to values safely below\nsparking thresholds The functionality of GEM-MSGCs has been demonstrated in hadronic beams [3] and in magnetic fields up to 1 Tesla Gains in\nexcess of 10 [3] have been reached with GEMs [4] which open the perspective\nto replace the MSGC by a simple passive anode structure Many interesting\nresults have been published by the CERN group [4,5] and the large scale\napplication of the GEM is foreseen in the HERA-B experiment [3,6]\nLike in all gaseous detectors, the maximum gain of GEMs is limited by\ndischarges Breakdown may occur through streamer discharge due to large\nspace charge densities Gains of about 10 [3] can be achieved in one amplification step depending on the strength and shape of the electric field [7] In the case of GEMs or similar devices a large amplification gap with low\ngain per unit length is preferable to a high condensed field Another limiting factor is a possible non-uniformity of the field caused by sharp electrode\nedges or variable resistivity of insulating surfaces The latter certainly limit\nthe maximum distance of the two conducting planes Indirect indications for\n\n\n1\n\n\nsurface discharges in GEMs have been reported [8] The inhomogeneities in\nthe surface resistivities can be avoided by coating the surface with a slightly\nconducting layer, a procedure which has been very successful with MSGCs Furthermore such a coating eliminates gain variations due to polarization of\nthe plastic and to charging up by ion deposition These unpleasant effects\nhave been observed in MSGCs on plastic substrates [9] and led to abandon\nthese devices To avoid charging-up it was proposed to add a small amount\nof water to the gas [2] which, however, may lead to fast aging [3]",
    "To avoid charging-up it was proposed to add a small amount\nof water to the gas [2] which, however, may lead to fast aging [3] The CERN\ngroup reported measurements using GEMs with cylindrical holes where gain\nvariations were totally absent [4] The following measurements have been performed with GEMs which were\novercoated with an amorphous carbon layer The behavior before and after\nthe coating was compared ##### 2 The setup\n\n\nThe GEMs have been produced at the CERN workshop and coated by a\nstandard industrial CVD process [1] The active GEM area was 35 × 27mm [2]\n\n(type M) and 100 × 100mm [2] (type L) The 50µm thick polyimide foil was\ncovered on both sides by 15µm copper, some of the foils have only 4µm\ncopper because of a second etching process GEM foils of type M have a\nsquare hole lattice with a pitch of 140µm, GEMs of type L have a staggered\nstructure with a minimum distance between two holes (center to center) of\n140µm The hole diameters varied between 45 and 90µm at the narrowest\npart of the Kapton and 70 to 110µm at the copper layers A top view of\ntypical GEM foils is shown in figure 1 The quality of the first small series (type M) was exceptionally poor with\nlarge variations of the hole diameters of about 30% and many defects All\nthe other GEM foils we investigated were of high quality like those shown in\nthe figure The GEMs were glued onto G10 frames and inserted in MSGCs constructed in such a way as to allow an easy exchange of the GEMs With the\ngluing of the GEMs onto frames special care has to be taken to the flatness\nof the GEMs Variations in the distance between MSGC structure and GEM\n\nfoil lead to large gain variations The MSGC structure had 300µm pitch, the anodes and cathodes were 10\nand 170µm wide The gas volume of 6mm height was subdivided into two\nequal halves by the GEM We operated the MSGC+GEM with a gas mixture\n\n\n1 a-Si:C:H:N coating : Fraunhofer Gesellschaft f¨ur Schicht und

hole\nstructure (right) 3\n\n\nof Ar/DME of 50:50, a variable GEM voltage below 700V and a drift field\nof about 3 5kV/cm The MSGC anodes were grounded The voltages were\nchosen such that the drift field below the GEM foil was slightly higher than\nabove The chamber was irradiated with Fe-55 and an α source (Ra-226) The active area of the MSGC+GEM was scanned with a computer controlled moveable table and a collimated Fe-55 source ##### 3 Results\n\n\n3 1 Electrical properties of the GEMs\n\n\nWe have measured the electric resistance of the GEMs before and after the\ncoating The electrical resistance of the small GEMs was about 10 [13] Ωbefore and 10 [10] Ωafter the coating The apparent resistivity of the uncoated\npolyimide increases by about one and a half orders of magnitude during the\npolarization process of about one day duration Figure 2 compares its variation with time to the coated version which is completely stable Notice the\ndifferent scales For the larger GEMs (type L) the resistance before coating was about 10 [14] Ω The reason for the higher resistance compared to the\nsmall GEMs is not fully understood A reason may be a different polyimide\nmaterial or different processing After the coating the resistance of the large\nGEMs was of the order of 10 [12] Ω (The resistivity of the coating was increased\nto reduce dark currents )\n\n\n3 2 Energy resolution\n\n\nAs mentioned before, the GEMs of the first small series (type M) show large\nvariations of the hole diameters For this reason the energy resolution of the\nuncoated GEMs of this type is rather poor This is illustrated in Figure 3\nwhere the iron spectrum is compared to that of the coated GEM In both\ncases the irradiated area is about 20mm [2] Scanning with a strongly collimated source we measured gain variation by a factor two whereas they are\nin the range of about 10% for the coated GEM (Figure 4) The superior\nbehavior of the coated GEM is probably explained by its more homogenous\nfield The large high quality GEMs (type L) showed comparable energy resolutions and gain variations before and after coating 4\n\n\n14\n10\n\n\n13\n10\n\n\n12\n10\n\n\n11\n10\n\n\n\nSiegen

uniformity for an uncoated and a coated\nMSGC+GEM 7\n\n\n3 3 Gain stability\n\n\nFor the uncoated GEMs drastic gain variations due to polarization of the\nKapton and to charging up by ion deposition are observed Figure 5 shows\nthe gain as a function of time The gain increases by about a factor of\ntwo within 40 hours after switching on the HV To disentangle the effects\nof polarization and charging-up we have measured the gain across the active\nGEM area after different time intervals The GEM was irradiated at a fixed\nposition near its center The results are displayed in Figure 6 Initially the\n\n≈\ngain was rather uniform across the GEM (curve 1) After 60 hours (curve\n2) the gain has globally increased but at the irradiated spot an additional\n40% increase is observed The uniform gain increase of the whole GEM\nis explained by polarization of the polyimide whereas the additional local\nincrease at the irradiated spot is due to charging-up by ion deposition The\ngain remains high for several days after the source has been removed The gain of coated GEMs is nearly stable directly after switching on the\nHV This is illustrated in Figure 7 3 4 Maximum achievable Gain\n\n\nFigure 8 shows the gas amplification as a function of the cathode voltage\nfor different constant GEM voltages The leftmost curve is obtained with a\ncathode voltage of the MSGC of 50V only which is needed solely to direct\nthe electrons towards the anodes The GEM can safely be operated at gains\nof a few hundred Both the coated and uncoated GEMs start to produce\ndischarges at amplification factors above 1000 (Figure 9) The discharges do\nnot destroy or modify the performance of the GEM",
