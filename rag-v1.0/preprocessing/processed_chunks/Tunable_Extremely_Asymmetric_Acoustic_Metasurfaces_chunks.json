    "**Tunable Extremely Asymmetric Acoustic Metasurfaces Made by Coupled Membrane**\n\n\n**Resonators**\n\n\nSongwen Xiao, Suet To Tang, and Z Yang*\n\n\n_1_ _Department of Physics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology_\n\n\n_Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China_\n\n# **Abstract**\n\n\nWe report the experimental demonstration of tunable asymmetric acoustic metasurfaces with\n\n\nextreme contrast, made by two decorated membrane resonators (DMRs) coupled via a sealed\n\n\nair column The front side of the metasurface is impedance matched to air and perfectly\n\n\nabsorbing, while the backside is hard and totally reflecting When a suitable DC voltage is\n\n\napplied to the backside DMR with proper electrodes, the surface impedance of the back side\n\n\nof the metasurfaces can be tuned from one extreme to the other, such that the backside\n\n\nbecomes impedance matched to air and totally absorbing, while the front side becomes\n\n\nperfectly reflecting The metasurface also exhibits high transmission contrast around two\n\n\nfrequencies The tunability of the reflection is over 23 dB at 388 Hz, and that of the\n\n\ntransmission is over 33 dB at 240 Hz and 590 Hz with 600 V of applied voltage We further\n\n\ndemonstrate one-side impedance matched metasurface with tunable working frequency 324 2\n\n\nHz to 335 Hz and reflection contrast over 31 dB 1\n\n\nAcoustic wave absorption has been intensively studied in the past decades due to its\n\n\ngreat importance in both scientific research and engineering applications For conventional\n\n\nmaterials such as porous material [1], or micro-perforated plate absorber [2], large thickness\n\n\nis usually required in order to maintain their acoustical performance at low frequency, which\n\n\ndefinitely limits their usage in real applications In the past decade, substantial attention has\n\n\nbeen focused onto the local resonators based acoustic metamaterials [3, 4] to overcome the\n\n\nchallenges faced by the conventional materials Dissipation energy density could be greatly\n\n\nincreased through resonant states, and with careful design of the structure parameters to\n\n\nbalance dissipation and scattering effects, perfect absorption have been experimentally\n\n\nachieved with membrane resonators [5 – 7] that is sub-wavelength in physical size Structures\n\n\nthat combined space-coiling and Helmholtz resonators could also achieve high absorption [8\n\n\n– 10] The concept of coherent perfect absorber originally developed for electromagnetic\n\n\nwaves [11 – 13] that relied on two coherent counter-propagating waved with specific phase\n\n\nand amplitude to achieve perfect absorption have been demonstrated recently with acoustic\n\n\nwaves as well [14] For an acoustic metasurface, no contrast would be more extreme than\n\n\nbeing perfectly absorbing or totally reflecting Extremely asymmetric absorbers that have one\n\n\nsurface being perfectly absorbing and the other surface totally reflecting have also been\n\n\nexperimentally demonstrated in waveguide flanked either by a pair of Helmholtz resonators\n\n\n[15] or by a pair of hybrid membrane resonators [16] These asymmetric absorbers were\n\n\nmounted on the sidewall of a waveguide Their configuration makes it difficult to turn the\n\n\nwhole area of acoustic barriers into perfectly absorbing In this paper we report the experimental demonstration of a coupled membrane\n\n\nresonator (CMR) that exhibits extremely asymmetric properties of its two metasurfaces at\n\n\nlow frequency, i",
    "In this paper we report the experimental demonstration of a coupled membrane\n\n\nresonator (CMR) that exhibits extremely asymmetric properties of its two metasurfaces at\n\n\nlow frequency, i e , the front surface is perfectly absorbing while the back surface is totally\n\n\nreflecting The configuration makes it straightforward to assemble into planar sound barriers\n\n\nwith the entire surface being perfectly absorbing We further demonstrate that the two\n\n\nsurfaces of the CMR can be tuned by applied DC voltage, such that the front surface becomes\n\n\ntotally reflection while the back surface becomes perfectly absorbing At other frequencies,\n\n\nthe transmission of the metasurface can be tuned by over 30 dB with the applied voltage Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate that the frequency at which perfect absorption occurs\n\n\ncan be tuned by applied voltage by over 10 8 Hz for a one-sided metasurface with a hard wall\n\n\nback surface 2\n\n\nFigure 1 (a) The

3\n\n\nThe structure of the CMR is schematically shown in the insert of Fig 1a It consisted\n\n\nof two decorated membrane resonators (DMRs), denoted as DMR-A and DMR-B,\n\n\nrespectively, mounted on a rigid hollow cylinder of 25 mm in length The sealed space\n\n\nbetween the DMRs was filled with air The two DMRs were therefore coupled via the air\n\n\ncolumn in between DMR-A consisted of a circular rubber membrane 27 mm in radius\n\n\nmounted on a rigid frame and a central disk 9 mm in radius and its mass was adjusted from\n\n\n120 to 180 mg The change of mass was accomplished by adding/removing putty stuck to the\n\n\ndisk DMR-B consisted of a membrane of the same radius as DMR-A, and a central disk of 6\n\n\nmm in radius and 160 mg in mass The thickness of the membrane is about 0 15 mm for both\n\n\nDMRs More pre-stress was intentionally introduced in the membrane of DMR-A than that of\n\n\nDMR-B, so that the first two eigen-frequencies of DMR-A are higher than that of DMR-B A\n\n\nmodified impedance tube method [17] was employed to conduct the acoustic measurements The inner radius of the impedance tube was 50 mm The sample was mounted on a rigid\n\n\naluminum plate with a hole of proper size, and the whole assembly could fill up the inner\n\n\ncross section of the impedance tube Figure 1(a) shows the transmission spectra of the two DMRs when they were\n\n\nmeasured individually The disk mass of DMR-A was the optimum value of 180 mg Both\n\n\nspectra show typical two-peak and one-dip feature of a simple DMR [3] within the frequency\n\n\nrange below 1500 Hz The first transmission peak slightly below 200 Hz is due to the first\n\n\neigenmode of the DMRs They happen to be nearly the same, even though the disk mass of\n\n\nDMR-A is heavier than that of DMR-B, because both the tension in the membrane and the\n\n\nradius of the disk in DMR-A are larger The second transmission peak around 720 Hz is due\n\n\nto the second eigenmode of DMR-A It is higher than that of DMR-B at 640 Hz because of\n\n\nthe higher tension in the membrane, and because the area not in direct contact with the central\n\n\ndisk is smaller As a result, the transmission dip frequency due to the anti-resonance of DMR\n\nA is around 400 Hz, while that of DMR-B is around 340 Hz According to the hybrid resonance mechanism of DMR backed by a rigid cavity [7],\n\n\nto achieve perfect absorption with the CMR, the hybrid resonance frequency of one DMR\n\n\n(say DMR-A) under rigid cavity condition with given depth (fixed at 25 mm in this case)\n\n\nmust be close to the anti-resonance frequency of the other DMR (say DMR-B), which acts as\n\n\na rigid wall The starting trial mass of the central disk of DMR-A for perfect absorption\n\n\nexperiments was 120 mg Figure 1(b) shows the absorption spectra of the CMR when sound\n\n\nwaves were incident to the DMR-A side The absorption did not reach unity at first when the\n\n\ndisk mass was 120 mg, because its hybrid resonance frequency was still well above the anti\n\n4\n\n\nresonance frequency of DMR-B, and the cavity depth was not well suited As more putty was\n\n\nadded to the disk of DMR-A, the absorption peak moved lower and towards the anti\n\nresonance of DMR-B, while the required cavity depth approached 25 mm Finally, at 180 mg\n\n\nof disk mass the absorption reached near unity The transmission (red curve, left axis), reflection (green curve, left axis), and\n\n\nabsorption (purple curve, right axis) spectra of the CMR when sound waves were incident to\n\n\nthe DMR-A side are shown in Fig 1(c) Due to the coupling of the two DMRs via the air\n\n\ncavity, only one main transmission dip is seen around 400 Hz The smaller feature near 340\n\n\nHz is due to the monopole resonance of the CMR The reflection reaches the first minimum\n\n\naround 200 Hz, while the transmission reaches near unity, due to the first eigenmode of both\n\n\nDMRs As a result, the absorption is small, and the metasurface becomes highly transparent At the second reflection minimum of 0 12 around 335 Hz, however, the transmission is also\n\n\nlow (~ 0 06), and the metasurface absorbs most (98 %) of the incident waves, even though\n\n\nthe area of the membrane is 3 4 (= (50/27) [2] ) times smaller than the impedance tube, and the\n\n\nthickness of the CMR (the length of the hollow cylinder) is less than 1/40 of the\n\n\ncorresponding wavelength in air Indeed, from the surface impedance extracted from the\n\n\nexperimental data shown in Fig 1(d), one can see that near 335 Hz, the imaginary part of the\n\n\nimpedance cross the zero line, while the real part is only ~ 10 % larger than the air impedance\n\n\n_Z_ 0 In the meantime, from the reflection spectrum of the CMR shown in Fig 1(e) when sound\n\n\nwaves were incident to the DMR-B side, one can see that the minimum near 200 Hz due to\n\n\nthe first eigenmode is still present, while the one at 335 Hz is completely absent The surface\n\n\nimpedance shown in Fig 1(f) at the DMR-B side is about _Z_ = (10 – 32 _i_ ) _Z_ 0 at 335 Hz,\n\n\nexhibiting a hard surface that reflects most of the incident sound The metasurface\n\n\nasymmetric contrast is at the extreme at 335 Hz, i e , one side is perfectly absorbing and the\n\n\nother side is totally reflecting Next, we modified DMR-B to make the metasurface voltage tunable In Ref 18, we\n\n\nachieved voltage tunability by turning the central disk into one of the parallel capacitor\n\n\nelectrodes The applied voltage exerted an electrostatic force to the central disk, and the\n\n\nscheme could change the first eigenmode frequency but not the second one, because at the\n\n\nsecond eigenmode only the portion of the membrane not in direct contact with the central\n\n\ndisk was vibrating [3] Here we use a scheme shown in the insert in Fig 2(a) that changes the\n\n\neffective free-vibrating area of the membrane not in direct contact with the central disk The\n\n\nbottom surface of the membrane (purple color) was coated with carbon grease as the soft\n\n\nelectrode (golden color) The top surface of the membrane was placed very close to a rigid\n\n\n5\n\n\nfishnet ring electrode (golden color) with an outer radius of 27 mm (the same as the\n\n\nmembrane) and an inner radius of 20 mm When DC voltage was applied between the two\n\n\nelectrodes, the fishnet ring held the portion of the membrane underneath immobile, even\n\n\nthough sound waves could still pass through the fishnet electrode The size of the membrane\n\n\nthat could vibrate in response to the incident sound was reduced from the entire membrane\n\n\nbounded by the rigid frame (light blue) to the portion inside the inner radius of the fishnet\n\n\nring Indeed, as the transmission spectra of the modified DMR-B shown in Fig 2(a) depict,\n\n\nthe two transmission peaks and the dip all moved to higher frequency At 800 V, the first\n\n\neigenmode shifted by 25 Hz, the anti-resonance frequencies shifted by 55 Hz, and the second\n\n\neigenmode shifted by 240 Hz as compared to the case without applied voltage The vibration\n\n\nprofile measured by laser vibrometer in Fig 2(b) shows clearly that the vibration amplitude\n\n\nof the edge portion of the membrane underneath the fishnet ring (marked by the arrows) was\n\n\nheld down by the applied voltage At 800 V, this portion of the membrane was almost\n\n\nmotionless, marking the upper limit of the voltage tunability of DMR-B The incident sound\n\n\nwave intensity was about 120 dB when the laser vibrometer measurements were performed",
    "The incident sound\n\n\nwave intensity was about 120 dB when the laser vibrometer measurements were performed 6\n\n\nFigure 2 (a) The transmission spectra of DMR-B when measured alone The insert is a side-view\n\n(upper) and a front-view (lower) schematic of the device The insert is a side-view\n\n(upper) and a front-view (lower) schematic of the device (b) The vibration profile of DMR-B at three\n\napplied voltages The arrows mark the position of the inner edge of the fishnet ring electrode (c) The\n\ntransmission of the CMR device at 0 and 600 V The dashed lines mark the frequencies at which the\n\ntransmission contrast ratio between the two spectra is the largest (d) The reflection spectra (solid\n\ncurves) at several applied voltage when sound waves were incident to the DMR-B side The dashed\n\nline is the transmission spectrum of the CMR device at 600 V The modified DMR-B was then installed back onto the original CMR The\n\n\ntransmission spectra of the CMR at 0 and 600 V of DC voltage are shown in Fig 2(c) 2(c) Large\n\n\nshift in the transmission peak and dip frequencies lead to large transmission contrast As\n\n\nmarked by the two dashed lines at 240 Hz and 590 Hz, the on/off transmission contrast ratio\n\n\nat these two frequencies is over 33 dB Near these two frequencies, the metasurface functions\n\n\nas a transmission tunable sound switch In the meantime, the reflection spectra shown in Fig 2(d) under sound wave incidence onto the DMR-B side change from total reflection, as is in\n\n\nthe original metasurface, to perfect absorption, with minimum reflection as low as 0 07 at 388\n\n\nHz at 600 V The on/off contrast ratio in reflection is over 23 dB In the meantime, as the\n\n\ntransmission is 0 006, the absorption is less than 0 005 from unity, indicating 99",
    "005 from unity, indicating 99 5% of\n\n\nincident energy absorption by the metasurface The DMR-A side remains totally reflecting\n\n\nnear 388 Hz The metasurface is now in the second extreme asymmetric state tuned by the\n\n\nexternal voltage At 388 Hz, the DMR-B side is perfectly absorbing and the DMR-A is totally\n\n\nreflecting Near the original total absorption frequency of 335 Hz at 0 V, the reflection on the\n\n\nDMR-A side is still low but as the transmission is near maximum, leading to low absorption Therefore, near 335 Hz the CMR is nearly transparent Finally, we demonstrate a single-side asymmetric metasurface that exhibits perfect\n\n\nabsorption frequency of its front surface tunable by voltage, while the back surface remains\n\n\ntotally reflecting throughout the voltage tuning The basic structure of the metasurface is a\n\n\nhybrid membrane resonator [7] made by a DMR-C backed by a rigid cavity 25 mm in depth The structure components of the DMR, including the electrode coating on the membrane and\n\n\nthe fishnet electrode, are the same as the voltage tunable DMR-B except for the central disk,\n\n\nwhich is 5 mm in radius and 120 mg in weight The smaller radius of the central disk in\n\n\nDMR-C, and therefore larger free-vibration membrane area, while having the same disk mass\n\n\nas DMR-B leads to lower eigenmode frequencies than DMR-B Figure 3 shows the reflection\n\n\nspectra at several applied voltage The reflection dip frequency changes from 324 2 Hz to 335\n\n\nHz for voltage tuning from 0 to 1200 V The higher saturation voltage observed here as\n\n\ncompared to DMR-B is due to the delicate dependence of the tuning function on the detailed\n\n\n7\n\n\nstructure of the device, such as the flatness of the fishnet electrode and the uniformity of the\n\n\ncarbon grease on the bottom surface of the membrane The reflection minimum is within the\n\n\nrange of 0 0205 to 0 15, corresponding to absorption in the deviation range of 4 × 10 [-4] to 0 02\n\n\nfrom unity The reflection contrast between 0 and 600 V at 324 2 Hz is 0 74/0 0205, or 31 dB Figure 3",
    "Figure 3 The reflection spectra of the single-side asymmetric metasurface device at several applied\n\n\nvoltage In summary, we have demonstrated a 3 [rd] type of extremely asymmetric acoustic\n\n\nmetasurface device made by coupling two decorated membrane resonators with a sealed air\n\n\ncolumn in between The entire front-view cross section of the device is the same as that of the\n\n\nmembrane, as the cavity does not occupy extra lateral space when viewed in the sound\n\n\npropagation direction This is different from the two earlier types of devices [15, 16], which\n\n\noperate only in waveguides, and the functional components (Helmholtz resonators [15] or\n\n\nhybrid membrane resonators [16]) occupy extra lateral space alongside the waveguides when\n\n\nviewed in the wave propagation direction As a result, it is very difficult to assemble these\n\n\ndevices to form a continuous planar barrier with the entire surface being perfectly absorbing,\n\n\nas the portions of the lateral area occupied by the functional devices are usually highly\n\n\nreflecting When voltage-tuning components are added to the present device, it becomes a\n\n\nmultiple-function metasurface with large tunable transmission and reflection contrast ratio Unlike the earlier version of voltage tuning devices [18], the present mechanism can change\n\n\nthe frequencies of several eigenmodes by changing the effective membrane size When many\n\n\nof these devices are assembled to form a planar wall, transmission and reflection tunable zone\n\n\nwalls with each device individually tunable could perform planar focusing, directional\n\n\ntransmission and reflection, and other interesting functions 8\n\n\nAcknowledgement – This work was supported by AoE/P-02/12 from the Research\n\n\nGrant Council of the Hong Kong SAR government **References**\n\n\n1 F C Sgard, X Olny, N Atalla, and F Castel, _Appl Acoust_ **66**, 625 (2005) 2 D Y Maa, J Acoust Soc Am **104**, 2861 (1998) 3 Z Yang, J Mei, M Yang, N Chan, and P Sheng, _Phys Rev Lett _ **101**, 204301\n(2008) 4 Z Liu, X Zhang, Y Mao, Y Y Zhu, Z Yang, C T Chan, and P Sheng, _Science_ **289**,\n1734 (2000) 5 J Mei, G Ma, M Yang, Z Yang, W Wen, and P Sheng, _Nat Commun _ **3**, 756\n(2012) 6 M Yang, C Meng, C Fu, Y Li, Z Yang, and P Sheng, _Appl Phys Lett _ **107**, 104104\n(2015) 7 G Ma, M Yang, S Xiao, Z Yang, and P Sheng, _Nature Mater _ **13,** 3994 (2014) 8 X Cai, Q Guo, G Hu, and Z Yang, _Appl Phys Lett _ **105**, 121901 (2014) 9 Y Li and B M Assouar, _Appl Phys Lett_ **108**, 063502 (2016) 10 X Wu, C Fu, X Li, Y Meng, Y Gao, J Tian, L Wang, Y Huang, Z Yang, and W Wen, _Appl Phys Lett _ **109**, 043501 (2016) 11 Y D Chong, L Ge, H Cao, and A D Stone, _Phys Rev Lett _ **105** (2010) 12 W Wan, Y Chong, L Ge, H Noh, A D Stone, and H Cao, _Science_ **331**, 889 (2011) 13 P Wei, C Croënne, S Tak Chu, and J Li, _Appl Phys Lett _ **104**, 121902 (2014) 14 C Meng, X Zhang, S T Tang, M Yang, and Z Yang, _Sci Rep _ **7**, 43574 (2017)\n15 A Merkel, G Theocharis, O Richoux, V Romero-García, and V Romero-García, and V Pagneux, _Applied_\n_Physics Letters_ **107**, 244102 (2015)\n16 Caixing Fu, Xiaonan Zhang, Min Yang, Songwen Xiao, and Z Yang, _Appl Phys Lett_ **110**, 021901 (2017)\n17 K M Ho, Z Yang, X X Zhang, and P Sheng, _Appl Acoust _ **66**, 751 (2005) 18 Songwen Xiao, Guancong Ma, Yong Li, Zhiyu Yang, Ping Sheng, _Appl Phys Lett _\n**106**, 091904 (2015) 9"
