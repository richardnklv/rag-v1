Project_\n_California Institute of Technology_\n_Pasadena, CA 91125_\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nWe propose a method for in-situ measurement of the length of kilometer\nsize Fabry-Perot cavities in laser gravitational wave detectors The method\nis based on the vernier, which occurs naturally when the laser incident on\nthe cavity has a sideband By changing the length of the cavity over several\nwavelengths we obtain a set of carrier resonances alternating with sideband\nresonances From the measurement of the separation between the carrier\nand a sideband resonance we determine the length of the cavity We apply\nthe technique to the measurement of the length of a Fabry-Perot cavity in\nthe Caltech 40m Interferometer and discuss the accuracy of the technique 1 submitted to Measurement Science and Technology\n\n\n### **1 Introduction**\n\nVery long Fabry-Perot cavities serve as measuring devices for interferometric\ngravitational wave detectors, which are currently under construction [1, 2, 3] Among them is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO)\nwhich will have 4 km long cavities [2] The cavity length, defined as the coatingto-coating distance between its mirrors, is an important parameter for these gravitational wave detectors It determines the detector sensitivity and its overall performance Therefore, the length must be known with high accuracy, especially\nif more than one wavelength of laser is required to resonate in the cavity Since\nthe length of LIGO Fabry-Perot cavities can change by 0 4 mm due to ambient\nseismic motion of the ground we do not need to measure the length with accuracy\nbetter than a millimeter Measurement of distances of order a few kilometers with millimeter accuracy\nrequires special techniques, such as GPS or optical interferometry Application\nof the GPS technique would be difficult because the mirrors of the gravitational\nwave detectors are inside a vacuum envelope and the GPS receivers cannot be\nplaced very close to the reflective surfaces of the mirrors On the other hand\noptical interferometry provides both convenient and precise way to measure distances [4] Common techniques are the method of fractional fringe, the method\nof synthetic wavelength and the method frequency scanning [5] Variations of\nthese techniques for different applications are discussed in the SPIE Publication\n\n[6] Although these techniques may provide high precision length measurements\n(100 µm and better) they are not well suited for Fabry-Perot cavities of the gravitational wave detectors All these techniques require installation of additional\noptics, modification of the detector configuration and alignment In this paper we propose a technique for in-situ measurement of the cavity\nlength which requires no special equipment or modification to the interferometer The technique is based on the ability of the Fabry-Perot cavity to resolve\nclose spectral lines The only requirement is that there be at least two close wavelengths in the laser incident on the Fabry-Perot cavity This requirement will be\neasily satisfied by all gravitational wave detectors, which are currently under construction, because optical sidebands are an essential part of their signal extraction\nschemes For single wavelength input laser a Fabry-Perot cavity produces an array of\nresonances along its optical axis The resonances are equally spaced and separated by the half-wavelength of the laser By moving one of the mirrors over\nseveral wavelengths, and thus changing the cavity length, we can observe these\n\n\n1\n\n\nresonances Two slightly different wavelengths give rise to two sets of resonances\nwith slightly different spacings, thereby forming a vernier scale along the optical\naxis Mechanical verniers have been extensively used in various precision measurement devices, such as calipers and micrometers The idea of a vernier is that\nan enhanced precision is obtained if two slightly different length scales are used\nsimultaneously [7], [8] The technique we propose here is an extension of the\nvernier idea to the length scales set by the laser wavelengths Our method is similar to the method developed by Vaziri and Chen [9] for\napplication to multimode optical fibres They obtain the intermodal beat length\nof the two-mode optical fibres by measuring a separation between the resonances\ncorresponding to these modes We developed our method independently of them\nfor application to the very long Fabry-Perot cavities in gravitational wave detectors Although different in motivation and underlying physics our method resembles theirs, because of the common vernier idea ### **2 Theory of vernier method**\n\n\nA mechanical vernier is a combination of two length scales which usually differ\nby 10% The optical vernier, described in this paper, is made out of two laser\nwavelengths which differ by roughly one part in 10 [8] To use the laser wavelengths\nin exactly the same way the mechanical verniers are used would be impossible Instead we relate the optical vernier with the beat length, as we describe below Let the primary length scale be a and a secondary length scale be a [′] Assume\nthat a [′] - a and consider two overlapping rulers made out of these length scales,\nwhich start at the same point Let z be a coordinate along the rulers with origin at\nthe starting point The coordinates for the two sets of marks are\n\n\nz = Na, (1)\nz [′] = N [′] a [′], (2)\n\n\nwhere N and N [′] are integers Each mark on the secondary rule is shifted with respect to the corresponding mark on the primary ruler The shift accumulates as we\nmove along the z-axis At some locations along z-axis the shift becomes so large\nthat the mark on the secondary ruler passes the nearest mark on the primary ruler The first passage occurs at z = b, where b is the beat length, defined according to\nthe equation\n1\n\n(3)\n\nb [= 1] a [−] a [1] [′] [ ]\n\n\n\na [−] a [1]\n\n\n\n(3)\na [′] [ ]\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nOther passages occur at multiples of the beat length:\n\n\ny = mb, (4)\n\n\nwhere m is integer Thus the number of beats within a given length, z [′], is equal\nto the integer part of the fraction z [′] /b The beat number, m, is related to the order\nnumbers of the two nearest marks on the different rulers:\n\n\nm = N − N [′] (5)\n\n\nPeriodicity of the beats manifests itself in the similarity relation\n\n\n\nz [′] − z (6)\nb\n\n\n\n− z\n\n= [z] [′] [ −] [y]\na b\n\n\n\nDerivation of this identity is given in the Appendix Let us define the shift of the mark at z [′] on the secondary ruler with respect to\nthe nearest mark at z on the primary ruler as a fraction\n\n\nµ = [z] [′] [ −] [z] (7)\n\na\n\n\nThen the similarity relation, equation (6), allows us to express the length of the\nsecondary ruler in terms of the beat length:\n\n\nz [′] = y + µb (8)\n= (m + µ)b (9)\n\n\nTherefore, if we know the beat number, m, and the shift, µ, we can find the length\nof the ruler We illustrate the method on an example of a vernier with length scales: a = 1\nand a [′] = 1 12 9 [1]\n, shown in figure 1 In this case the beat length is 3 [ There are no]\n\nm = 0\npassages within the length shown in the figure, therefore From the figure\nwe see that the shift is equal to 0 6 Thus we find that the length of the secondary\nruler, z [′] = µb, is equal to 5 6, which is a correct result as can be seen from the\nfigure For a single wavelength laser a Fabry-Perot cavity produces an array of resonances along its optical axis Two slightly different wavelengths give rise to\ntwo overlapping arrays of resonances with slightly different spacings and form a\nvernier scale 3\n\n\nFigure 1: An example of vernier The integers are the order numbers N and N [′] The length of the secondary ruler (z [′] = 5a [′] ) is equal to 5 6 Let z be a coordinate along the optical axis of the cavity Assume that the\ninput mirror is placed at z = 0 and the end mirror is at z = L In the experiment\nbelow different wavelengths are obtained by phase modulation of a single wavelength laser Let the frequency of the phase modulation be f then the modulation\nwavelength is Λ = c/f Three most prominent components of the phase modulated laser are the carrier with wavelength λ 0 and the first order sidebands with\nwavelengths λ ±1, which are defined as\n\n\n\n1\n= [1]\nλ ±1 λ\n\n\n\n\n[1] ± [1]\n\nλ 0 Λ\n\n\n\n(10)\nΛ [ ]\n\n\n\nAny two wavelengths can be used to form a vernier For example, the primary\nscale can be set by the carrier, a = 2 [1] [λ] [0] [, and the secondary scale can be set by]\n\neither of the sidebands: a [′] = [1]\n\n2 [λ] [±][1] [ Then the coordinates for the carrier and the]\nsideband resonances are given by the equations (1)-(2) Correspondingly, the beat\nlength is set by the modulation wavelength:\n\n\n\nb = [Λ] (11)\n\n2 [ ]\n\n\n\nThus a vernier occurs in Fabry-Perot cavity when a multiple wavelength laser\nbeam is incident on it This vernier can be used to find the cavity length Similar\n\n\n4\n\n\nto the length in the equation (9), the cavity length can be can be expressed in terms\nof the beat length:\n\nL = (m + µ) [Λ] (12)\n\n2 [ ]\n\n\nThe beat number, m, can be found from the approximate length of the cavity\n\n\n\n, (13)\n�\n\n\n\nm ≡ floor\n\n\n\nL\n� Λ/2\n\n\n\nwhere “floor” stands for greatest integer less than As long as the approximate\nlength is known with accuracy better than the beat length the beat number is defined exactly The shift, µ, can be obtained from observation of the carrier and\nsideband resonances ### **3 Measurement results and discussion**\n\n\nWe apply the technique to measure the length of Fabry-Perot cavity of the 40m\nprototype of LIGO interferometer at Caltech For our measurement we use one\nof the arm cavities of the interferometer and the Pound-Drever signal extraction\nscheme [10] The setup is shown in figure 2 A single wavelength (λ 0 = 514 5 nm) laser beam is generated by Ar laser The\nsidebands on the laser are produced by phase modulation at the Pockels cell, which\ntakes its input from the RF oscillator with modulation frequency of 32 7 MHz The modulation wavelength corresponding to this frequency is Λ = 9 16795 m The resulting multi-wavelength laser beam is incident on the Fabry-Perot cavity,\nwhose approximate length, L = 38 5 ± 0 2 meters, is known from previous measurements From the approximate length we find the beat number:\n\n\nm = 8 (14)\n\n\nBoth the input and the end mirror of the cavity are suspended from wires and\nare free to move along the optical axis of the cavity The signals are obtained from\nthe photodiodes PD1 and PD2 The signals are: the cavity transmitted power and\nthe Pound-Drever signal, which is the output of the mixer Although either signal\ncan be used for length measurement we choose the Pound-Drever signal because\nit provides higher precision than the signal based on the transmitted power In the experiment the motion of the front mirror is damped by a local control\nsystem and the end mirror is swinging freely through several wavelengths As the\n\n\n5\n\n\nFigure 2: Setup of experiment end mirror moves through the resonances sharp peaks appear in the output signals From the trace on the oscilloscope, figure 3, we obtain the times when the mirror\npasses through the carrier resonances, t 0 (p), and the sideband resonances, t ±1 (p),\nwhere p is integer from 1 to 6 The times are found with a precision of 1 µs, set\nby the resolution of the oscilloscope The carrier resonances are located at\n\n\nz 0 (p) = (p − 1) [λ] [0] (15)\n\n2 [+][ u,]\n\n\nwhere u is an unknown constant, which cancels in the calculation The location of\nthe sideband resonances can be found from the times t ±1 (p) if the trajectory of the\nmirror is known We find the approximate trajectory of the mirror by polynomial\ninterpolation between the carrier resonances The plot of the interpolated mirror\ntrajectory is shown in figure 4 Let the interpolation polynomial be F (t) Using\nthe polynomial we find the location of the sideband resonances as follows\n\n\nz −1 (p) = F (t −1 (p)) + u, (16)\nz +1 (p) = F (t +1 (p)) + u (17)\n\n\nOnce the locations of the carrier and the sideband resonances are known we can\n\n\n6\n\n\nFigure 3: Oscilloscope trace of Pound-Drever signal The resonances corresponding to the carrier and the sidebands are marked by S 0 and S ±1 Other resonances\nresult from the higher order modes due to imperfections of the laser and tilts of\nthe mirrors",
