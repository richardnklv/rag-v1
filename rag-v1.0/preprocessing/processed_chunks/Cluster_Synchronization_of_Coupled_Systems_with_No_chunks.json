cluster\nsynchronization For coupled nonlinear systems, e g g , chaotic oscillators, algebraic and graph topological\nclustering conditions are derived for either identical models ( [20]) or nonidentical models ( [21], [22])\nunder the key assumption that the input matrix of all systems is identical and it can stabilize the system\ndynamics of all individual agents via linear state feedback (i , chaotic oscillators, algebraic and graph topological\nclustering conditions are derived for either identical models ( [20]) or nonidentical models ( [21], [22])\nunder the key assumption that the input matrix of all systems is identical and it can stabilize the system\ndynamics of all individual agents via linear state feedback (i e , the so-called QUAD condition) For\nidentical generic linear systems which are partial-state coupled [23], [24], a stabilizing control gain matrix\nsolved from a Ricatti inequality is utilized by all agents, and agents are pinned with some additional agents\nso that the interaction subgraph of each cluster contains a directed spanning tree The system models introduced above can describe a rich class of applications for multi-agent systems A\ncommon characteristic is that the uncoupled system dynamics of all the agents can be stabilized by linear\nstate feedback attenuated by a unique matrix (i e , static state feedback) [23], [24] This simplification\nallows the derivation of coupling conditions to be independent of the control design of any agent, and thus\noffers scalability to a static coupling strategy This kind of benefit still exists for nonidentical nonlinear\nsystems ( [21], [22]) which are full-state coupled, since all the system dynamics can be constrained by\na common Lipchitz constant (Lipchitz can imply the QUAD condition [25]) However, for the class of\npartial-state coupled nonidentical linear systems, the stabilizing matrices for distinct linear system models\nare usually different It follows that if conventional static couplings (e g those in [23], [24]) are utilized,\nthe required conditions for the interaction graph will be correlated with the control designs of all individual\nsystems, and even worse these conditions may never be satisfied for some system models (These points\nwill become clear in Remark 3 of the main part) Therefore, new coupling strategies should be designed\nso as to cope with the nonidentical system parameters The goal of this paper is to achieve state cluster synchronization for partial-state coupled nonidentical\nlinear systems, where agents with the same uncoupled dynamics are supposed to synchronize together This is a problem of practical interest, for instance, maintaining different formation clusters for different\ntypes of interconnected vehicles, providing different synchronization frequencies for different groups of\nclocks using coupled nonidentical harmonic oscillators, reaching different consensus values for people with\ndifferent opinion dynamics, and so on In order to tackle the issues raised by using the conventional _static_\ncouplings, this paper proposes to use couplings with a _dynamic_ structure that incorporates a vanishing\nauxiliary variable to facilitate interactions among connected agents With the proposed dynamic couplings,\nan algebraic necessary and sufficient condition is derived to check the cluster synchronizability of a\nnonidentical linear multi-agent system This newly derived algebraic condition is independent of the\ncontrol design of any agent, and can subsume those published results for integrator systems in [14]–[17] as\nspecial cases Due to the entanglement between nonidentical system matrices and the parameters from the\ninteraction graph, the algebraic condition may not be straightforward to check Thus, a graph topological\ninterpretation of the algebraic condition is provided which requires that the interaction subgraph associated\nwith each cluster contains a directed spanning tree This spanning tree condition is further shown to be a\nnecessary condition when the clusters and the inter-cluster links form an acyclic structure This conclusion\nreveals the indispensability of direct links among agents belonging to the same cluster under such special\ninter-cluster structures, and further strengthens the sufficiency statement presented initially in [23] We\nalso derived lower bounds for the local coupling strengths in different clusters, which are independent of\nthe control designs of any agent thanks to the dynamic coupling structure Using the commonly used static\ncoupling structures as in [23], [24], these lower bounds may need centralized computation and may even\nhave no feasible solutions at all The derived results in this paper are illustrated by simulation examples\nfor two applications: cluster heading alignment of nonidentical ships and cluster phase synchronization\nof nonidentical harmonic oscillators The organization of this paper is as follows: Following this section, the problem formulation is presented\nin Section II In Section III, both algebraic and graph topological conditions for cluster synchronization\nare developed Applications of this work and simulation examples are provided in Section IV Concluding\nremarks and discussions for future investigations follow in Section V 3\n\n\nII P ROBLEM S

Cluster synchronization for the nonidentical harmonic oscillators in (22) V V C ONCLUSIONS\n\nThis paper investigates the state cluster synchronization problem for multi-agent systems with nonidentical generic linear dynamics By using a dynamic structure for coupling strategies, this paper derives both\nalgebraic and graph topological clustering conditions which are independent of the control designs For\nfuture studies, cluster synchronization which can only be achieved for the system outputs is a promising\ntopic, especially for linear systems with parameter uncertainties or for heterogeneous nonlinear systems For completely heterogenous linear systems, research works following this line are conducted by the\nauthors in [28] and others in [29] For nonlinear heterogeneous systems, the new theory being established\nfor _complete output_ synchronization problems [30], [31] may be further extended Another interesting\nchallenge existing in cluster synchronization problems is to discover other graph topologies that meet\nthe algebraic conditions If the interactions among agents are based on communication systems, the issue\nof reducing communication demands by event-triggered control techniques [32], [33] would also be a\npromising topic for future studies 14\n\n\n\nA PPENDIX\n\n_A 14\n\n\n\nA PPENDIX\n\n_A Proof of Lemma 1_\n\n\n\n1 0\n_Proof _ Denote _S_
