present study, superheating treatment has been applied on A357 reinforced with 0 5 wt %\n(Composite 1) and 1 0 wt % (Composite 2) continuous stainless steel composite In Composite 1 the\nmicrostructure displayed poor bonding between matrix and reinforcement interface Poor bonding\nassociated with large voids also can be seen in Composite 1 The results also showed that coarser\neutectic silicon (Si) particles were less intensified around the matrix-reinforcement interface From\nenergy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping, it was clearly shown that the distribution\nof eutectic Si particles were less concentrated at poor bonding regions associated with large voids Meanwhile in Composite 2, the microstructure displayed good bonding combined with more\nconcentrated finer eutectic Si particles around the matrix-reinforcement interface From EDS\nelemental mapping, it was clearly showed more concentrated of eutectic Si particles were\ndistributed at the good bonding area The superheating prior to casting has influenced the\nmicrostructure and tends to produce finer, rounded and preferred oriented α-Al dendritic structures **Introduction**\n\nMicrostructure and its formation play a pivotal role in determining relationships between processing\nand performance of engineering materials [1] In continuous aluminium matrix composites (AMCs)\nwhich are fabricated via casting technique, some of the critical microstructural features are grain\nsize, dendritic arm spacing and silicon morphology in the eutectic phase [2] Meanwhile in\ndiscontinuous AMCs, the most important aspect of the microstructure is the distribution of the\nreinforcement particles and this depends on the processing and fabrication routes involved [3] Interfaces constitute an important microstructural feature of composite materials [4] There are\ntransition zones of finite dimensions at the boundary between the fibre and the matrix where\ncompositional and structural discontinuities can occur over distances varying from an atomic\nmonolayer to over five orders of magnitude in thickness Most of the mechanical and physical\nproperties of the MMCs such as strength, stiffness, ductility, toughness, fatigue, creep, coefficient\nof thermal expansion, thermal conductivity and damping properties are dependent on the interfacial\ncharacteristic The interface plays a crucial role in transferring the load efficiently from the matrix\nto the reinforcement The strengthening and stiffening of composites are dependent on the load\nacross the interface A high bonding strength is required at the interface for effective load transfer\n\n[5] A strong bond is usually formed with the reaction between the matrix and the reinforcement\nmeanwhile the reaction products determining the nature of the bond A lot of researches have been done regarding eutectic Si particles [6-9] Meanwhile, the effects of\nsuperheating on the refinement of Si phase have been observed in Al-7Si-0 55Mg alloy [10] and\nhypereutectic Al-Si alloys [11,12] However, the effects of superheating on the distribution of\neutectic Si particles have yet be studied This is especially at the interface between the matrix alloy\nand the reinforcement which is a critical region that is affected during the solidification process of\nmetal matrix composites (MMCs) If the interface is not tailored properly, it can lead to the\ndegradation of the properties of the composites [5] The objective of this research is to study the\neffects of superheating on the distribution of eutectic silicon particles in A357 continuous stainless\nsteel composites **Experimental Procedure**\n\nThe raw material used as a matrix alloy in this research work was primary cast ingot A357 alloy The alloy has been cast by continuous casting process and was delivered in the form of bar The\ncontinuous 304 stainless steel wires (SSw) with 500 µm diameter were used as reinforcement which\nwere embedded in the A357 matrix alloy to produce the composite specimens The primary cast ingot A357 alloy was melted in crucibles by using electric furnace Prior to\ncasting for composite specimens, the 304 stainless steel wires were aligned with uniform\ndimensions for A357 reinforced with 0 5 and 1 0 wt % stainless steel composites respectively The\nprimary cast ingot A357 alloy undergoes superheating treatment at 900ºC for 1 hour before pouring\ninto moulds The 314 stainless steel mould with aligned 304 stainless steel wires were heated at\n250°C for 1 hour The composite specimens were produced by pouring the molten primary A357\ncast ingot into the 314 stainless steel mould at 750°C by gravity casting technique **Results and Discussion**\n\nFigure 1 shows the solidification microstructure of Composite 1 which illustrates globular and\nrandomly oriented α-Al dendrites around the continuous stainless steel wire (SSw) reinforcement\n\n[13,14] It also can be seen that lesser amount of eutectic Si particles was present at the grain\nboundaries in the A357 matrix alloy around the stainless steel wire reinforcement relatively [15] The microstructure displayed poor bonding which is associated with large voids and less\nconcentrated coarser eutectic Si particles around the matrix-reinforcement interface and also present\nof macro crack in Composite 1",
    "The microstructure displayed poor bonding which is associated with large voids and less\nconcentrated coarser eutectic Si particles around the matrix-reinforcement interface and also present\nof macro crack in Composite 1 Figure 2 shows the close-up of dotted square region in Figure 1 It reveals remarkably poor bonding\nwhich again is associated with large voids along the matrix-reinforcement interface The inexistence\nof matrix alloy and eutectic Si particles leads to poor bonding and also generation of micro crack\nalong the nearby matrix-eutectic Si interface However, the nearby acicular eutectics Si particles\nabout more than 20 μm length are remain unaffected Figure 3 shows the EDS elemental mapping of the region where poor bonding associated with large\nvoids were seen in Composite 1 It shows the intensity of various elements (Al, Si and Mg) at and\naround the poor bonding region in this composite From EDS elemental mapping, it was clearly\nshowed less concentrated presence of eutectic Si particles at the poor bonding region which are\nassociated with large voids However, more concentrated of eutectic Si particles can be observed at\nthe good bonding region (rounded dotted line) as shown in Si element (Figure 1) Away from the\npoor bonding region, the eutectic Si particles are found to be evenly distributed throughout the\nA357 matrix alloy [16] Figure 1 SEM micrograph of\nComposite 1 Dotted rectangular\nregion shows poor bonding associated\nwith large voids Poor bonding\ndenoted by I and macro crack denoted\nby C Figure 2 Close-up of matrixreinforcement interface Composite 1\n(dotted rectangular region in Figure 1) Micro cracks denoted by M (c) (d)\n\n\nFigure 3 EDS elemental mapping of poor bonding associated with large\nvoids in Composite 1;
