Georg ◊\nLANGLEY MEMOIR ON MECHANICAL FLIGHT\nPART\nI 1887 TO 1896\nBY\nS P LANGLEY\nEDITED\nBY CHARLES M MANLY\nCHAPTER I\nINTRODUCTORY\nI2 announced in 1891,3 as the result of experiments carried on by\nme through previous years, that it was possible to construct machines\nwhich would give such a velocity to inclined surfaces that bodies\nindefinitely heavier than the air could be sustained upon it, and\nmoved through it with great velocity In particular, it was stated that\na plane surface in the form of a parallelogram of 76 2 cm × 12 2 cm (30 × 4 8 inches), weighing 500 grammes (1 1 lbs ), could be driven\nthrough the air with a velocity of 20 metres (65 6 feet) per second in\nabsolutely horizontal flight, with an expenditure of 1/200 horse-\npower, or, in other terms, that 1 horse-power would propel and\nsustain in horizontal flight, at such a velocity (that is, about 40 miles\nan hour), a little over 200 pounds weight of such surface, where the\nspecific gravity of the plane was a matter of secondary importance,\nthe support being derived from the elasticity and inertia of the air\nupon which the body is made to run rapidly It was further specifically remarked that it was not asserted that\nplanes of any kind were the best forms to be used in mechanical\nflight, nor was it asserted, without restrictions, that mechanical flight\nwas absolutely possible, since this depended upon our ability to get\nhorizontal flight during transport, and to leave the earth and to return\nto it in safety Our ability actually to do this, it was added, would\n\n\nresult from the practice of some unexplored art or science which\nmight be termed Aerodromics, but on which I was not then prepared\nto enter I had at that time, however, made certain preliminary experiments\nwith flying models, which have been continued up to the present\nyear,4 and at the same time I have continued experiments distinct\nfrom these, with the small whirling-table established at Washington The results obtained from the latter being supplemental to those\npublished in “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” and [p002] being more\nor less imperfect, were at first intended not for publication, but for my\nown information on matters where even an incomplete knowledge\nwas better than the absence of any It is to be remembered that the mechanical difficulties of artificial\nflight have been so great that, so far as is known, never at any time in\nthe history of the world previous to my experiment of May, 1896, had\nany such mechanism, however actuated, sustained itself in the air for\nmore than a few seconds—never, for instance, a single half-minute—\nand those models which had sustained themselves for these few\nseconds, had been in almost every case actuated by rubber springs,\nand had been of such a size that they should hardly be described as\nmore than toys This refers to actual flights in free air, unguided by\nany track or arm, for, since the most economical flight must always be\na horizontal one in a straight line,5 the fact that a machine has lifted\nitself while pressed upward against an overhead track which compels\nthe aerodrome to move horizontally and at the proper angle for\nequilibrium, is no proof at all of real “flight ”\nI desire to ask the reader’s consideration of the fact that even ten\nyears ago,6 the whole subject of mechanical flight was so far from\nhaving attracted the general attention of physicists or engineers, that\nit was generally considered to be a field fitted rather for the pursuits\nof the charlatan than for those of the man of science Consequently,\nhe who was bold enough to enter it, found almost none of those\nexperimental data which are ready to hand in every recognized and\nreputable field of scientific labor Let me reiterate the statement,\nwhich even now seems strange, that such disrepute attached so lately\nto the attempt to make a “flying-machine,” that hardly any scientific\nmen of position had made even preliminary investigations, and that\n\n\nalmost every experiment to be made was made for the first time To\ncover so vast a field as that which aerodromics is now seen to open,\nno lifetime would have sufficed The preliminary experiments on the\nprimary question of equilibrium and the intimately associated\nproblems of the resistance of the sustaining surfaces, the power of the\nengines, the method of their application, the framing of the hull\nstructure which held these, the construction of the propellers, the\nputting of the whole in initial motion, were all to be made, and could\nnot be conducted with the exactness which would render them final\nmodels of accuracy I beg the reader, therefore, to recall as he reads, that everything\nhere has been done with a view to putting a trial aerodrome\nsuccessfully in flight within a few years, and thus giving an early\ndemonstration of the only kind which is conclusive in the eyes of the\nscientific man, as well as of the general public—a demonstration that\nmechanical flight is possible-—by actually flying All that has been done, has been with an eye principally to this\nimmediate [p003] result, and all the experiments given in this book are\nto be considered only as approximations to exact truth All were made\nwith a view, not to some remote future, but to an arrival within the\ncompass of a few years at some result in actual flight that could not be\ngainsaid or mistaken Although many experimenters have addressed themselves to the\nproblem within the last few years—and these have included men of\neducation and skill—the general failure to arrive at any actual flight\nhas seemed to throw a doubt over the conclusions which I had\nannounced as theoretically possible When, therefore, I was able to state that on May 6, 1896, such a\ndegree of success had been attained that an aerodrome, built chiefly\nof steel, and driven by a steam engine, had indeed flown for over half\na mile—that this machine had alighted with safety, and had\nperformed a second flight on the same day, it was felt that an advance\nhad been made, so great as to constitute the long desired experimental\ndemonstration of the possibility of mechanical flight These results\nwere communicated to the French Academy in the note given below 7\nIndependently of the preliminary experiments in aerodynamics\nalready published, I had been engaged for seven years in the\n\n\ndevelopment of flying models Although the work was discouraging\nand often resulted in failure, success was finally reached under the\nconditions just referred to, which obviously admitted of its being\nreached again, and on a larger scale, if desired [p004]\nIn view of the great importance of these experiments, as\ndemonstrating beyond question the practicability of the art of\nmechanical flight, and also in view of the yet inchoate state of this art,\nI have thought it worth while to publish an account of them\nsomewhat in detail, even though they involve an account of failures;\nsince it is from them, that those to whom it may fall to continue such\nconstructions, will learn what to avoid, as well as the raison d’etre of\nthe construction of the machines which have actually flown In an established art or science, this description of the essays and\nfailures which preceded full knowledge would have chiefly an\nhistorical interest Here almost nothing is yet established beyond the\nfact that mechanical flight has actually been attained The history of\nfailure is in this case, then, if I do not mistake, most necessary to an\nunderstanding of the road to future success, to which it led, and this\nhas been my motive in presenting what I have next to say so largely in\nnarrative form",
    "The history of\nfailure is in this case, then, if I do not mistake, most necessary to an\nunderstanding of the road to future success, to which it led, and this\nhas been my motive in presenting what I have next to say so largely in\nnarrative form ◊\n[p005]\nCHAPTER II\nPRELIMINARY\nPart I of the present work is intended to include an account of the\nexperiments with actual flying models, made chiefly at or near\nWashington, from the earliest with rubber motors up to the\nconstruction of the steam aerodromes that performed the flights of\nMay 6 and November 28, 1896 An account of some observations conducted at Washington, with\nthe whirling table, on the reaction of various surfaces upon the air, is\nrelegated to a later part The experiments with working models, which led to the successful\nflights, were commenced in 1887, and it has seemed to me preferable\nto put them at first in chronological order, and to present to the\nreader what may seem instructive in their history, while not\nwithholding from him the mistaken efforts which were necessarily\nmade before the better path was found In this same connection, I\nmay say that I have no professional acquaintance with steam\nengineering, as will, indeed, be apparent from the present record, but\nit may be observed that none of the counsel which I obtained from\nthose possessing more knowledge was useful in meeting the special\nproblems which presented themselves to me, and which were solved,\nas far as they have been solved, by constant “trial and error ”\nI shall, then, as far as practicable, follow the order of dates in\npresenting the work that has been done, but the reader will observe\nthat after the preliminary investigations and since the close of 1893,\nat least four or five independent investigations, attended with\nconstant experiment and radically distinct kinds of construction, have\nbeen going on simultaneously We have, for instance, the work in the\nshop, which is of two essentially different kinds: first, that on the\nframes and engines, which finally led to the construction of an engine\nof unprecedented lightness; second, the experimental construction of\nthe supporting and guiding surfaces, which has involved an entirely\ndifferent set of considerations, concerned with equilibrium and\nsupport in flight These constructions, however successful, are\n\n\nconfined to the shop and are, as will be seen later, useless without a\nlaunching apparatus The construction of a suitable launching\napparatus itself involved difficulties which took years to overcome And, finally, the whole had to be tested by actual flights in free air,\nwhich were conducted at a place some 30 miles distant from the shop\nwhere the original construction went on [p006]\nSimultaneously with these, original experiments with the whirling-\ntable were being conducted along lines of research, which though\nnecessary have only been indicated We have, then, at least five\nsubjects, so distinct that they can only be properly treated separately,\nand accordingly they will be found in Chapters VII, VIII, IX and X, ◊\nand in Part Third [in preparation] It is inevitable that in so complex a study some repetition should\npresent itself, especially in the narrative form chosen as the best\nmethod of presenting the subject to the reader Each of these chapters,\nthen, will contain its own historical account of its own theme, so that\neach subject can be pursued continuously in the order of its actual\ndevelopment, while, since they were all interdependent and were\nactually going on simultaneously, the order of dates which is followed\nin each chapter will be a simple and sufficient method of reference\nfrom one to the other EXPERIMENTS\nWITH\nSMALL\nMODELS\nIn order to understand how the need arises for such experiments in\nfixing conditions which it might appear were already determined in\nthe work “Experiments in Aerodynamics,”8 it is to be constantly borne\nin mind, as a consideration of the first importance, that the latter\nexperiments, being conducted with the whirling-table, force the model\nto move in horizontal flight and at a constant angle Now these are\nideal conditions, as they avoid such practical difficulties as\nmaintaining equilibrium and horizontality, and for this reason alone\ngive results more favorable than are to be expected in free flight Besides this, the values given in “Aerodynamics” were obtained\nwith rigid surfaces, and these surfaces themselves were small and\ntherefore manageable, while larger surfaces, such as are used in actual\n\n\nflight, would need to be stiffened by guys and like means, which offer\nresistance to the air and still further reduce the results obtained It is,\ntherefore, fairly certain, that nothing like the lift of 200 pounds to the\nhorse-power for a rate of 40 miles an hour,9 obtained under these\nideal conditions with the whirling-table, will be obtained in actual\nflight, at least with plane wings The data in “Aerodynamics” were, then, insufficient to determine\nthe conditions of free flight, not alone because the apparatus compels\nthe planes to move in horizontal flight, but because other ideally\nperfect conditions are obtained by surfaces rigidly attached to the\nwhirling-table so as to present an angle to the wind of advance which\nis invariable during the course of the experiment, whereas the\nsurfaces employed in actual flight may evidently change this angle\nand cause [p007] the aerodrome to move upward or downward, and\nthus depart from horizontal flight so widely as to bring prompt\ndestruction To secure this balance, or equilibrium, we know in theory, that the\ncenter of gravity must be brought nearly under the center of pressure,\nby which latter expression we mean the resultant of all the forces\nwhich tend to sustain the aerodrome; but this center of pressure, as\nmay in fact be inferred from “Aerodynamics,”10 varies with the\ninclination of the surface It varies also with the nature of the surface\nitself, and for one and the same surface is constantly shifted unless the\nwhole be rigidly held, as it is on the whirling-table, and as it cannot\nbe in free flight Here, then, are conditions of the utmost importance, our knowledge\nof which, as derived from ordinary aerodynamic experiments, is\nalmost nothing A consideration of this led me to remark in the\nconclusion of “Aerodynamics”:\n“I have not asserted, without qualification, that mechanical flight is\npractically possible, since this involves questions as to the method of\nconstructing the mechanism, of securing its safe ascent and descent, and\nalso of securing the indispensable condition for the economic use of the\npower I have shown to be at our disposal—the condition, I mean, of our\nability to guide it in the desired horizontal direction during transport—\nquestions which, in my opinion, are only to be answered by further\nexperiment and which belong to the inchoate art or science of aerodromics\non which I do not enter ”\n\n\nIt is this inchoate art of aerodromics which is begun in the\nfollowing experiments with actual flying machines In all discussions of flight, especially of soaring flight, the first\nsource to which one naturally looks for information is birds But here\ncorrect deductions from even the most accurate of observations are\nvery difficult, because the observation cannot include all of the\nconditions under which the bird is doing its work If we could but see\nthe wind the problem would be greatly simplified, but as the matter\nstands, it may be said that much less assistance has been derived from\nstudious observations on bird-flight than might have been anticipated,\nperhaps because it has been found thus far impossible to reproduce in\nthe flying machine or aerostatic model the shape and condition of\nwing with its flexible and controllable connection with the body, and\nespecially the instinctive control of the wing to meet the requirements\nof flight that are varying from second to second, and which no\nautomatic adjustment can adequately meet At the time I commenced these experiments, almost the only flying-\nmachine which had really flown was a toy-like model, suggested by A Pénaud, a young Frenchman of singular mechanical genius, who\ncontributed to the world many most original and valuable papers on\nAeronautics, which may be found in the journal “L’Aeronaute ” His\naeroplane is a toy in size, with a small propeller [p008] whose blades\nare usually made of two feathers, or of stiff paper, and whose motive\npower is a twisted strand of rubber This power maintains it in the air\nfor a few seconds and with an ordinary capacity for flight of 50 feet or\nso, but it embodies a device for automatically securing horizontal\nflight, which its inventor was the first to enunciate 11\nAlthough Pénaud recognized that, theoretically, two screws are\nnecessary in an aerial propeller, as the use of a single one tends to\nmake the apparatus revolve on itself, he adopted the single screw on\naccount of the greater simplicity of construction that it permitted One\nof these little machines is shown as No 11, Plates 1 and 2 AB is a stem about 2 5 mm in diameter and 50 cm long It is bent\ndown at each end, with an offset which supports the rubber and the\nshaft of the screw to which it is hooked The screw HH1 is 21 cm in\ndiameter, and has two blades made of stiff paper; two are preferable,\namong other reasons, because they can be made so that the machine\n\n\nwill lie flat when it strikes in its descent About the middle of AB there\nis a “wing” surface DC, 45 cm long and 11 cm broad, the ends C and\nD being raised and a little curved In front of the screw is the\nhorizontal rudder GK having a shape like that of the first surface, with\nits ends also turned up, and inclined at a small negative angle with this\nwing surface Along its center is a small fin-like vertical rudder that\nsteers the device laterally, like the rudder of a ship The approximately, but not exactly, horizontal rudder serves to\nhold the device in horizontal flight, and its operation can best be\nunderstood from the side elevation Let CD be the wing plane set\nnearly in the line of the stem, which stem it is desired to maintain, in\nflying, at a small positive angle, α, with the horizon, α being so\nchosen that the tendency upward given by it will just counteract the\naction of gravity The weight of the aeroplane, combined with the\nresistance due to the reaction of the air caused by its advance would,\nunder these conditions, just keep it moving onward in a horizontal\nline, if there were no disturbance of the conditions There is, however,\nin the wing no power of self-restoration to the horizontal if these\nconditions are disturbed But such a power resides in the rudder GK,\nwhich is not set parallel to the wing, but at a negative angle (α1) with\nit equal to the positive angle of the wing with the horizon It is\nobvious that, in horizontal flight, the rudder, being set at this angle,\npresents its edge to the wind of advance and consequently offers a\nminimum resistance as long as the flight is horizontal If, however, for\nany reason the head drops down, the rear edge of the rudder is raised,\nand it is at once subjected to the action of the air upon its upper\nsurface, which has a tendency to lower the rear of the machine and to\nrestore horizontality Should the head rise, the lower [p009] surface of\nthe rudder is subjected to the impact of the air, the rear end is raised,\nand horizontality again attained In addition to this, Pénaud appears\nto have contemplated giving the rudder-stem a certain elasticity, and\nin this shape it is perhaps as effective a control as art could devise\nwith such simple means Of the flight of his little machine, thus directed, Pénaud says:\n“If the screw be turned on itself 240 times and the whole left free in a\nhorizontal position, it will first drop; then, upon attaining its speed, rise and\nperform a regular flight at 7 or 8 feet from the ground for a distance of\n\n\nabout 40 metres, requiring about 11 seconds for its performance Some\nhave flown 60 metres and have remained in the air 13 seconds 12 The\nrudder controls the inclination to ascend or descend, causing oscillations in\nthe flight Finally the apparatus descends gently in an oblique line,\nremaining itself horizontal ”\nThe motive power is a twisted hank of fine rubber strips, which\nweighs 5 grammes out of a total of 16 grammes for the whole\nmachine, whose center of gravity should be in advance of the center\nof surface CD, as will be demonstrated in another place This device\nattracted little notice, and I was unfamiliar with it when I began my\nown first constructions at Allegheny, in 1887 My own earliest models employed a light wooden frame with two\npropellers, which were each driven by a strand of twisted rubber 13 In\nlater forms, the rubber was enclosed and the end strains taken up by\nthe thinnest tin-plate tubes, or better still, paper tubes strengthened\nby shellac Little was known to me at that time as to the proper proportions\nbetween wing surface, weight and power; and while I at first sought\nto infer the relation between wing surface and weight from that of\nsoaring birds, where it varies from\n1\n2\nto 1 sq ft",
    "ft of wing surface to the pound, yet the ratio was successively\nincreased in the earlier models, until it became 4 sq of wing surface to the pound, yet the ratio was successively\nincreased in the earlier models, until it became 4 sq ft to 1 pound It\nmay be well to add, however, that the still later experiments with the\nsteam-driven models, in which the supporting surface was\napproximately 2 sq ft to the pound, proved that the lack of ability of\nthese early rubber-driven models to properly sustain themselves even\nwith 4 sq ft ft of wing surface to the pound, was largely due to the fact\nthat the wings themselves had not been stiff enough to prevent their\nbeing warped by the air pressure generated by their forward motion During the years I presently describe, these tentative constructions\nwere [p010] renewed at intervals without any satisfactory result,\nthough it became clear from repeated failures, that the motive power\nat command would not suffice, even for a few seconds’ flight for\nmodels of sufficient size to enable a real study to be made of the\nconditions necessary for successful flight In these earliest experiments everything had to be learned about the\nrelative position of the center of gravity, and what I have called the\n\n\ncenter of pressure In regard to the latter term, it might at first seem\nthat since the upward pressure of the air is treated as concentrated at\none point of the supporting surface, as the weight is at the center of\ngravity, this point should be always in the same position for the same\nsupporting surface This relation, however, is never constant How\nparadoxical seems the statement that, if ab be such a supporting\nsurface in the form of a plane of uniform thickness and weight,\nsuspended at c (ac being somewhat greater than cb) and subjected to\nthe pressure of a wind in the direction of the arrow, the pressure on\nthe lesser arm cb will overpower that on the greater arm ac We now\nknow, however, that this must be so, and why, but as it was not\nknown to the writer till determined by experiments published later in\n“Experiments in Aerodynamics,” all this was worked out by trial in\nthe models",
    "We now\nknow, however, that this must be so, and why, but as it was not\nknown to the writer till determined by experiments published later in\n“Experiments in Aerodynamics,” all this was worked out by trial in\nthe models FIG 1 1 Diagram of suspended plane showing position of\nC P P It was also early seen that the surface of support could be\nadvantageously divided into two, with one behind the other, or one\nover the other, and this was often, though not always, done in the\nmodels At the very beginning another difficulty was met which has proved\na constant and ever-increasing one with larger models—the difficulty\nof launching them in the air It is frequently proposed by those\nunfamiliar with this difficulty, to launch the aerodrome by placing it\nupon a platform car or upon the deck of a steamer, and running the\ncar or boat at an increasing speed until the aerodrome, which is free\nto rise, is lifted by the wind of advance But this is quite impracticable\nwithout means to prevent premature displacement, for the large\nsurface and slight weight renders any model of considerable size\nunmanageable in the least wind, such as is always present in the open\nair It is, therefore, necessary in any launching apparatus that the\naerodrome be held rigidly until the very moment of release, and that\ninstant and simultaneous release from the apparatus be made at all\nthe sustaining points at the proper moment [p011]\nThere is but a very partial analogy in this case to the launching of a\n\n\nship, which is held to her ways by her great weight Here, the “ship”\nis liable to rise from her ways or be turned over laterally at any\ninstant, unless it is securely fastened to them in a manner to prevent\nits rising, but not to prevent its advancing The experiments with rubber-driven models commenced in April,\n1887, at the Allegheny Observatory, were continued at intervals\n(partly there, but chiefly in Washington) for three or four years,\nduring which time between thirty and forty independent models were\nconstructed, which were so greatly altered in the course of experiment\nthat more nearly one hundred models were in reality tried The result\nof all this extended labor was wholly inconclusive, but as subsequent\ntrials of other motors (such as compressed air, carbonic-acid gas,\nelectric batteries, and the like) proved futile, and (before the steam\nengine) only the rubber gave results, however unsatisfactory, in actual\nflight, from which anything could be learned, I shall give some brief\naccount of these experiments, which preceded and proved the\nnecessity of using the steam engine, or other like energetic motor,\neven in experimental models An early attempt was made in April, 1887, with a model consisting\nof a frame formed of two wooden pieces, each about 1 metre long and\n4 centimetres wide, made for lightness, of star-shaped section, braced\nwith cross-pieces and carrying two long strips of rubber, each about 1\nmm thick, 30 mm wide, 2 metres long, doubled, weighing 300\ngrammes Each of these strips could be wound to about 300 turns, one\nend being made fast to the front of the frame, the other to the shaft of\na four-bladed propeller 30 cm in diameter The wings were made of\nlightest pine frames, over which paper was stretched, and were\ndouble, one being superposed upon the other Each was 15 cm wide,\nand 120 cm long The distance between them was 12 cm and the\ntotal surface a little more than 3600 sq cm (4 square feet) In flying,\nthe rubber was so twisted that the propellers were run in opposite\ndirections The weight of the whole apparatus was not quite 1\nkilogramme, or about 1 pound to 2 feet of sustaining surface, which\nproved to be entirely too great a weight for the power of support When placed upon the whirling-table, it showed a tendency to soar at\na speed of about ten miles an hour, but its own propellers were utterly\ninsufficient to sustain it In this attempt, which was useful only in showing how much was to\nbe learned of practical conditions, the primary difficulty lay in making\nthe model light enough and sufficiently strong to support its power This difficulty continued to be fundamental through every later form;\nbut besides this, the adjustment of the center of gravity to the center\nof pressure of the wings, the disposition of the wings themselves, the\nsize of the propellers, the inclination and number of their blades, and\na great number of other details, presented themselves for\nexamination [p012] Even in the first model, the difficulty of launching\nthe machine or giving it the necessary preliminary impulse was\ndisclosed—a difficulty which may perhaps not appear serious to the\nreader, but which in fact required years of experiment to remove By June, 1887 two other models, embodying various changes that\nhad suggested themselves, had been constructed Each of these had a\nsingle propeller (one an\n18\n1\n2\n-inch\npropeller with eight adjustable blades, the other a 24-inch propeller\nwith four adjustable blades) and was sustained by two pairs of curved\nwings 4 feet 7 inches long It is, however, unnecessary to dwell\nfurther on these details, since these models also proved altogether too\nheavy in relation to their power, and neither of them ever made an\nactual flight At this period my time became so fully occupied with the\nexperiments in aerodynamics (which are not here in question) that\nduring the next two years little additional was done in making direct\ninvestigations in flight In June, 1889, however, new rubber-driven models were made in\nwhich the wooden frames were replaced by tubes of light metal,\nwhich, however, were still too heavy, and these subsequently by tubes\nof paper covered with shellac, which proved to be the lightest and\nbest material in proportion to its strength that had been found The\ntwisted rubber was carried within these tubes, which were made just\nstrong enough to withstand the end-strain it produced The front end\nof the rubber being made fast to an extremity of the tube, the other\nend was attached directly to the shaft of the propeller, which in the\n\n\nearly models was still supplied with four blades A detailed description of one of these early models, No 26, shown\nin Plates 1 and 4, follows:\nIn each of the two tubes of paper, stiffened with shellac, which form\na part of the framing, is mounted a hank of twisted rubber, which\nconnects with a propeller at the rear There are two pairs of wings,\nsuperposed and

easily launched by hand, and it was not until 1891 that\nthe first one was constructed light enough to actually fly This first\nflight was obtained from the north window of the dome of the\nAllegheny Observatory, on March 28, 1891, and imperfect as it was,\nserved to show that the proper balancing of the aerodrome which\nwould bring the center of gravity under the center of pressure, so as to\ngive a horizontal flight, had yet to be obtained From this time on until 1893, experiments continued to be made\nwith rubber-driven models, of which, as has been stated, nearly 40\nwere constructed, some with two propellers, some with one; some\nwith one propeller in front and one behind; some with plane, some\nwith curved, wings; some with single, some with superposed, wings;\nsome with two pairs of wings, one preceding and one following; some\n\n\nwith the Pénaud tail; and some with other forms A few of these early\nforms are indicated on the accompanying Plates 1 to 4, but it does not\nseem necessary to go into the details of their construction",
    "A few of these early\nforms are indicated on the accompanying Plates 1 to 4, but it does not\nseem necessary to go into the details of their construction No No 11 with which an early flight was made, closely resembles the\nPénaud model 11 with which an early flight was made, closely resembles the\nPénaud model No 13 has two propellers, one in front and one behind, with a\nsingle wing No 14 has two propellers, nearly side by side, but one slightly in\nadvance, with a single wing and a flat horizontal tail No 15 has one leading propeller and two broad wings, placed one\nbehind the other No 30 has the propeller shafts at an angle, and one pair of wings No 31 has the propeller shafts at an angle, and two pairs of wings\nsuperposed The wings in general were flat, but in some cases curved The\nrubber was usually wound to about 100 turns, and trouble continually\narose from its “kinking” and unequal unwinding, which often caused\nmost erratic flights It is sufficient to say of these that, rude as they were, much was\nlearned from them about the condition of the machines in free air,\nwhich could never be learned from the whirling-table or other\nconstrained flight The advantages and also the dangers of curved wings as compared\nwith plane ones, were shown, and the general disposition which\nwould secure an even balance, was ascertained; but all this was done\nwith extreme difficulty, since the brief flights were full of anomalies,\narising from the imperfect conditions of observation For instance, the\nmotor power was apparently exhausted more rapidly when the\npropellers were allowed to turn with the model at rest, than when it\nwas in motion, though in theory, in the latter case more power would\nseem to be expended and a greater speed of revolution obtained in a\ngiven time The longest flights obtainable did not exceed 6 or 8\nseconds in time, nor 80 to 100 feet in distance, and were not only so\nbrief, but, owing to the spasmodic action of the rubber and other\ncauses, so irregular, that it was extremely difficult to obtain even the\nimperfect results which were actually deduced from them [p014]\n\n\nABBREVIATIONS\nAND\nSYMBOLS\nEMPLOYED\nThe following rules and symbols were adopted for determining the\nrelative position of points on the aerodrome, some of them during\n1891, and some of them since All are given here for convenience of\nreference, though their chief application is to the larger steam\naerodromes described later Those which immediately follow were\nmeant to give some of the notation of descriptive geometry in\nuntechnical language for the use of the workmen employed Let X, Y\nand Z be three lines at right angles to each other, and passing through\nthe same point in space, O, lying at any convenient distance above the\nfloor of the work-shop The line X lies North and South;

    "That the calculated position of the CP at rest, as related to the\nCG, is trustworthy only in the case of the plane wing 2 The formula altogether failed with the curved wing, for which\nthe CP had to be carried indefinitely further backward On comparing the previous flights of November 14, with these, it\nseems that with the old rubber motor of 35 grammes and 50 turns, the\nsingle wing, either plane or curved, is altogether inferior to the double\nwing; while with the increased motor power of this day, the single\nwing, whether plane or curved, seems to be as good as the double\nwing It also seems that the curved wing was rather more efficient\nthan the plane one The weight of the rubber in each tube was 72 grammes, or 0 16\npounds; mean speed of flight in horizontal distance\n4\n1\n2\nmetres (about 15 feet) per second 16\nFrom experiments already referred to, there were found available\n\n\n300 foot-pounds of energy in a pound of rubber as employed, and in\n0 16 of a pound, 48 foot-pounds of energy were used;\n48\n33,000\nor 0 00145 = the horse-power exerted in [p019] one minute, but as\nthe power was in fact expended in 1/20 of that time we have 20 ×\n0 00145 = 0 029; that is, during the brief flight, about 0 03 of a\nhorse-power was exerted, and this sustained a total weight of only\nabout a pound In comparing this flight with the ideal conditions of horizontal\nflight in “Aerodynamics,” it will be remembered that this model’s\nflight was so irregular and so far from horizontal, that in one case it\nflew up and struck the lofty ceiling The angle with the horizon is, of\ncourse, so variable as to be practically unknown, and therefore no\ndirect comparison can be instituted with the data given on page 107\nof “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” but we find from these that at the\nlowest speed there given of about 35 feet per second, 0 03 of a horse-\npower exerted for three seconds would carry nearly one pound\nthrough a distance of somewhat over 100 feet in horizontal flight The number of turns of the propellers multiplied by the pitch\ncorresponds to a flight of about 16 metres, while the mean actual\nflight was about 12 It is probable, however, that there was really\nmore slip than this part of the observation would indicate It was also\nobserved that there seemed to be very little additional compensatory\ngain in the steering of No 30 for the weight of the long rudder-tail it\ncarried It may be remarked that in subsequent observations the\nsuperiority of the curved wing in lifting power was confirmed, though\nit was found more liable to accident than the flatter one, tending to\nturn the model over unless it was very carefully adjusted It may also be observed that these and subsequent observations\nshow, as might have been anticipated, that as the motor power\nincreased, the necessary wing surface diminished, but that it was in\ngeneral an easier and more efficient employment of power to carry a\nsurface of four feet sustaining area to the pound than one of three,\nwhile one of two feet to the pound was nearly the limit that could be\nused with the rubber motor 17\nIt may be remarked that the flights this day, reckoned in horizontal\ndistance, were exceptionally short, but that the best flights at other\n\n\ntimes obtained with these models (30 and 31) did not exceed 25\nmetres Such observations were continued in hundreds of trials,\nwithout any much more conclusive results [p020]\nThe final results, then, of the observations with rubber-driven\nmodels (which were commenced as early as 1887, continued actively\nthrough the greater portion of the year 1891 and resumed, as will be\nseen later, even as late as 1895), were not such as to give information\nproportioned to their trouble and cost, and it was decided to\ncommence experiments with a steam-driven aerodrome on a large\nscale ◊\n[p021]\nCHAPTER III\nAVAILABLE MOTORS\nIn the introductory chapter to “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” it\nwas asserted that\n“These researches have led to the result that mechanical sustentation of\nheavy bodies in the air, combined with very great speeds, is not only\npossible, but within the reach of mechanical means we actually possess ”\nIt was, however, necessary to make a proper selection in order to\nsecure that source of power which is best adapted to the requirements\nof mechanical flight Pénaud had used india rubber as the cheapest\nand at the same time the most available motor for the toys with which\nhe was experimenting, but when models were constructed that were\nheavier than anything made prior to 1887, it appeared, after the\nexhaustive trials with rubber referred to in the preceding chapter, that\nsomething which could give longer and steadier flights must be used\nas a motor, even for the preliminary trials, and the construction of the\nlarge steam-driven model known as No 0, and elsewhere described,\nwas begun Even before the completion of this, the probability of its\nfailure grew so strong that experiments were commenced with other\nmotors, which it was hoped might be consistent with a lighter\nconstruction These experiments which commenced in the spring of 1892 and\ncontinued for nearly a twelvemonth, were made upon the use of\ncompressed air, carbonic-acid gas, electricity in primary and storage\nbatteries, and numerous other contrivances, with the result that the\nsteam engine was finally returned to, as being the only one that gave\nany promise of immediate success in supporting a machine which\nwould teach the conditions of flight by actual trial, though it may be\nadded that the gas engine which was not tried at this time on account\nof engineering difficulties, was regarded from the first as being the\nbest in theory and likely to be ultimately resorted to All others were\nfundamentally too heavy, and weight was always the greatest enemy",
    "All others were\nfundamentally too heavy, and weight was always the greatest enemy It is the purpose of this chapter to pass in brief review the work that\nwas done and the amount of energy that was obtained with these\n\n\nseveral types of motors, as well as the obstacles which they presented\nto practical application upon working aerodromes INDIA\nRUBBER\nIndia rubber is the source of power to which the designer of a\nworking model naturally turns, where it is desirable that it shall be,\nabove all, light and free from the necessity of using complicated\nmechanism Rubber motors were, [p022] therefore, used on all of the\nearlier models, and served as the basis of calculations made to\ndetermine the amount of power that would be required to propel\naerodromes with other sources of energy Some of the disadvantages inherent in the use of rubber are at once\napparent, such as the limited time during which its action is available,\nthe small total amount of power, and the variability in the amount of\npower put forth in a unit of time between the moment of release and\nthe exhaustion of the power In addition, serious, though less obvious\ndifficulties, present themselves in practice There are two ways in which rubber can be used; one by twisting a\nhank of strands, and, while one end is held fast, allowing the other to\nrevolve; the other, by a direct longitudinal stretching of the rubber,\none end being held fast and the other attached to the moving parts of\nthe mechanism The former method was adopted by Pénaud, and was\nalso used in all of my early constructions, but while it is most\nconvenient and simple in its (theoretical) application, it has, in\naddition to the above drawbacks, that of knotting or kinking, when\nwound too many turns, in such a way as to cause friction on any\ncontaining tube not made impracticably large, and also that of\nunwinding so irregularly as to make the result of one experiment\nuseless for comparison with another In 1895, some experiments were made in which the latter method\nwas used, but this was found to involve an almost impracticable\nweight, because of the frame (which must be strong enough to\nwithstand the end pull of the rubber) and the mechanism needed to\nconvert the pull into a movement of rotation As the power put forth in a unit of time varies, so there is a\ncorresponding variation according to the original tension to which the\nrubber is subjected Thus in some experiments made in 1889 with a\n\n\nsix-bladed propeller 18 8 inches in diameter, driven by a rubber\nspring 1 3 inches wide, 0 12 inch thick and 3 feet long, doubled, and\nweighing 0 38 pound, the following results were obtained:\nNumber of twists of\nrubber\n50\n75\n100\nTime required to run\ndown\n7 sec 10 sec 12 sec",

turns, more than three\ntimes the amount of work was done and almost twice the amount of\npower developed, giving as a maximum for this particular instance\n328 foot-pounds per pound of rubber The usual method of employing the twisted rubber was to use a\nnumber of fine strands formed into a hank looped at each end One of\nthese hanks, consisting of 162 single or 81 double strands of rubber,\nand weighing 73 grammes, when given 51 turns developed 55 foot-\npounds of work, which was put out in 4 seconds This corresponds to\n0 01 horse-power per minute for one pound of rubber [p023]\nThe results of a large number of tests show that one pound of\ntwisted rubber can put forth from 450 to 500 or more foot-pounds of\nwork, but at the cost of an overstrain, and that a safe working factor\ncan hardly be taken at higher than 300 foot-pounds, if we are to avoid\nthe “fatigue” of the rubber, which otherwise becomes as marked as\nthat of a human muscle While twisting is an exceedingly convenient form of application of\nthe resilience of rubber to the turning of propelling wheels, the direct\nstretch is, as has been remarked, much more efficient in foot-pounds\nof energy developed by the same weight of rubber It was found that\nrubber could not, without undue “fatigue,” be stretched to more than\nfour and a half times its original length, though experiments were\nmade to determine the amount of work that a rubber band, weighing\none pound, was capable of doing, the stretching being carried to seven\ntimes its original length The results varied with the rubber used and\nthe conditions of temperature under which the experiments were\ntried, ranging from 1543 foot-pounds to 2600 foot-pounds The tests\n\n\nled to the conclusion that, for average working, one pound of rubber\nso stretched, is capable of doing 2000 foot-pounds of work, but, owing\nto the weight of the supporting frame and of the mechanism, this\nresult can be obtained only under conditions impracticable for a flying\nmachine In the more practicable twisted form it furnishes, as has\nbeen said, less than a fifth of that amount The conclusions reached from these experiments are:\n1 The length of the unstretched rubber remaining the same, the\nsustaining power will be directly proportional to the weight of rubber;\n2 With a given weight of rubber, the end strain is inversely\nproportional to the length of the unstretched rubber;\n3 With a given weight of rubber, the work done is constant,\nwhatever the form; hence if we let w = the work in foot-pounds, g =\nthe weight of the rubber in pounds, and k = a constant taken at 2000\nas given above, we have\nw = kg = 2000 g foot-pounds This is for an extension of seven units of length, so that for a unit of\nextension we would have approximately\nw = 300 g foot-pounds\nwhich for four units of extension corresponds very closely to the 1300\nfoot-pounds which Pénaud claims to have obtained 4 The end strain varies with the cross-section for a given unit of\nextension These results can lead to but one conclusion; that for the\ndevelopment of the same amount of power when that amount shall be\n1 horse-power or more, rubber weighs enormously more than a steam\nengine, besides being less reliable [p024] for a sustained effort, and,\ntherefore, cannot be used for propelling aerodromes intended for a\nflight that is to be prolonged beyond a few seconds 18\nIt may be desirable to present a tabular view of the theoretical\nenergy of available motors, which it will be noticed is a wholly\ndifferent thing from the results obtained in practice Thus, we\nrepresent the weight of rubber only, without regard to the weight of\nthe frame required to hold it In the steam engine, we consider the\ntheoretical efficiency per pound of fuel, without regarding the\nenormous waste of weight in water in such small engines as these, or\n\n\nthe weight of the engine itself We treat the hot-water engine in like\nmanner, and in regard to carbonic acid and compressed air, we take\nno note of the weight of the containing vessel, or of the cylinders and\nmoving parts In the same way we have the theoretical potency of\nelectricity in primary and storage batteries, without counting the\nweight of the necessary electromotors; and of the inertia-engine\nwithout discussing that of the

interesting to consider next, in even a roughly\napproximate way, what may be expected from these various sources\nof energy in practice STEAM\nENGINE\nThe steam engine on a small scale, and under the actual restrictions\nof the model, must necessarily be extremely wasteful of power If we\nsuppose it to realize 2 per cent of the theoretical energy contained in\nthe fuel, we shall be assuming more than was actually obtained The\nenergy of the fuel cannot be obtained at all, of course, without boiler\nand engine, whose weight, for the purpose of the following\ncalculation, must be added to that of the fuel; and if we suppose the\nweight of the boilers, engines and water, for a single minute’s flight,\nto be collectively ten pounds, we shall take an optimistic view of what\nmay be expected under ordinary conditions We have in this view\n1/500\n\n\nof the [p025] theoretical capacity possibly realizable under such\nconditions, but if we take\n1/1000\nwe shall probably be nearer the mark Even in this case we have,\nwhen using gasoline as fuel, 15,625 foot-pounds per minute, or nearly\n0 50 horse-power, as against 0091 horse-power in the case of the\nrubber, so that even with this waste and with the weight of the\nengines necessary for a single minute’s service, the unit weight of fuel\nemployed in the steam engine gives 55 times the result we get with\nrubber PL 5 RUBBER-PULL

result that is furnished by gasoline, since nearly the same boiler\nand engine will be used in either case Certain difficulties which at\nfirst appeared to be attendant on the use of gasoline on a small scale\ninduced me to make the initial experiments with alcohol This was\ncontinued because of its convenience during a considerable time, but\nit was finally displaced in favor of gasoline, not so much on account\nof the superior theoretical efficiency of the latter, as for certain\npractical advantages, such as its maintaining its flame while exposed\nto wind, and like considerations GUNPOWDER\nAlthough there are other explosives possessing a much greater\nenergy in proportion to their weight than gunpowder, this is the only\n\n\none which could be considered in relation to the present work, and\nthe conclusion was finally reached that it involved so great a weight\nin the containing apparatus and so much experiment, that, although\nthe simplicity of its action is in its favor where crude means are\nnecessary, experiments with it had better be deferred until other\nthings had been tried HOT\n-\nWATER\nENGINE\nA great deal of attention was given to the hot-water engine, but it\nwas never put to practical use in the construction of an aerodrome,\npartly on account of the necessary weight of a sufficiently strong\ncontaining vessel COMPRESSED\nAIR\nCompressed air, like the other possible sources of power, was\ninvestigated, but calculations from well-authenticated data showed\nthat this system of propelling engines would probably be inadequate\nto sustain even the models in long flights As the chief difficulty lies in\nthe weight, not of the air, but of the containing vessel, numerous\nexperiments were made in the construction of one at once strong and\nlight The best result obtained was with a steel tube 40 mm in\ndiameter, 428 mm in length, closed at the ends by heads united by\nwires, which safely contained 538 cubic cm of air at an initial\npressure of 100 atmospheres for a weight of 521 grammes [p026]\nIf we suppose this to be used, by means of a proper reducing valve,\nat a mean pressure of 100 pounds, for such an engine as that of\nAerodrome No 5, which takes 60 cubic cm of air at each stroke, we\nfind that (if we take no account of the loss by expansion) we have\n18,329 foot-pounds of energy available, which on the engine\ndescribed will give 302 revolutions of the propellers There are such limits of weight, and the engines must be driven at\nsuch high speeds, that the increased economy that might be obtained\nby re-heating the air would be out of the question The principal\nobject in using it would have been the avoidance of fire upon the\naerodrome, and the expansion of the unheated air would probably\n\n\nhave caused trouble with freezing, while the use of hot (i e superheated) water was impracticable So when, after a careful\ncomputation, it was found that, having regard to the weight of the\ncontaining vessel, only enough compressed air could be stored at 72\natmospheres and used at 4, to run a pair of engines with cylinders 0 9\ninch in diameter by 1 6 inches stroke, at a speed of 1200 revolutions\nper minute for 20 seconds, all further consideration of its adaptation\nto the immediate purpose was definitely abandoned This course,\nhowever, was not taken until after a model aerodrome for using\ncompressed air had been designed and partially built Then, after due\nconsideration, it was decided to make the test with carbonic-acid gas\ninstead GAS\nThe gas engine possesses great theoretical advantages At the time\nof these experiments, the gas engine most available for the special\npurposes of the models was one driven by air drawn through gasoline As the builders could not agree to reduce the weight of a one horse-\npower engine more than one-half of the then usual model, and as the\nweight of the standard engine was 470 pounds, it was obvious that to\nreduce this weight to the limit of less than 3 pounds was\nimpracticable under the existing conditions, and all consideration of\nthe use of gas was abandoned provisionally, although a gasoline\nengine of elementary simplicity was designed but never built I\npurposed, however, to return to this attractive form of power if I were\never able to realize its theoretical advantages on the larger scale\nwhich would be desirable ELECTRICITY\nAs it was not intended to build the model aerodromes for a long\nflight, it was thought that the electric motor driven by a primary or\nstorage battery might possibly be utilized It therefore occurred to me\nthat a battery might be constructed to give great power in proportion\nto its weight on condition of being short-lived, and that in this form a\nbattery might perhaps advantageously take the place of the dangerous\ncompressed-air tubes that were at the time (1893) [p027] under\nconsideration for driving the models I assumed that the longest flight\nof the model would be less than five minutes Any weight of battery,\n\n\nthen, that the model carried in consumable parts lasting beyond this\nfive minutes would be lost, and hence it was proposed to build a\nbattery, the whole active life of which would be comprised in this\ntime, to actuate a motor or motors driving one or two propellers According to Daniell, when energy is stored in secondary batteries,\nover 300,000 megergs per kilogramme of weight can be recovered\nand utilized if freshly charged 300,000 megergs = 0 696 horse-power for 1 min 300,000 megergs = 0 139 horse-power for 5 min In a zinc and copper primary battery with sulphuric acid and water,\none kilogramme of zinc, oxidized, furnishes at least 1200 calories as\nagainst 8000 for one kilogramme of carbon, but it is stated that the\nzinc energy comes in so much more utilizable a form that the zinc,\nweight for weight, gives practically, that is in work, 40 per cent that\nof carbon The kilogramme of carbon gives about 8000 heat units,\neach equal to 107 kilogrammetres, or about 6,176,000 foot-pounds Of this, in light engines, from 5 to 10 per cent, or at least 308,800\nfoot-pounds, is utilized, and\n2\n5\nof this, or about 124,000 foot-pounds, would seem to be what the\nkilogramme of zinc would give in actual work But to form the\nbattery, we must have a larger weight of fluid than of zinc, and\nsomething must be allowed for copper If we suppose these to bring\nthe weight up to 1 kilogramme, we might still hope to have 50,000\nfoot-pounds or 1 5 horse-power for one minute, or 0 3 horse-power\nfor 5 minutes Storage batteries were offered with a capacity of 25 horse-power\nfor 5 minutes per kilogramme, but according to Daniell one cannot\nexpect to get more than 0 139 horse-power from a freshly charged\nbattery of that weight for the same time The plan of constructing a battery of a long roll of extremely thin\nzinc or magnesium, winding it up with a narrower roll of copper or\nplatinized silver, insulating the two metals and then pouring over\nenough acid to consume the major portion of the zinc in 5 minutes,\nwas carefully considered, but the difficulties were so discouraging,\nthat the work was not undertaken The lightest motors of 1 horse-power capacity of which any trace\ncould be found weighed 25 pounds, and a prominent electrician stated\nthat he would not attempt to construct one of that weight In trials with a\n1\n2\nhorse-power motor driving an 80 cm propeller of 1 00 pitch-ratio, I\napparently obtained a development of 0 56 indicated horse-power at\n1265 revolutions; but at lower speeds when tried with the Prony\nbrake, the brake horse-power fell to 0 10 at 546 revolutions, and even\nat 1650 revolutions [p028] it was but 0 262 indicated, with a brake\nhorse-power of 0 144, or 55 per cent of that indicated With these results both of theoretical calculation and practical\nexperiment, all thought of propelling the proposed aerodrome by\nelectricity was necessarily abandoned CARBONIC\n-\nACID\nGAS\nAt the first inception of the idea, it seemed that carbonic-acid gas\nwould be the motive power best adapted for short flights It can be\nobtained in the liquid form, is compact, gives off the gas at a uniform\npressure dependent upon the temperature, and can be used in the\nordinary steam engine without any essential modifications The only\nprovision that it seemed, in advance, necessary to make, was that of\nsome sort of a heater between the reservoir of liquid and the engine,\nin order to prevent freezing, unless the liquid itself could be heated\nprevious to launching The engines in which it was first intended to use carbonic acid were\nthe little oscillating cylinder engines belonging to Aerodrome No",
    "The engines in which it was first intended to use carbonic acid were\nthe little oscillating cylinder engines belonging to Aerodrome No 1 The capacity of each cylinder was 21 2 cu cm , so that 84 8 cu cm of\ngas would be required to turn the propellers one revolution when\nadmitted for the full stroke, and 101,760 cubic cm for 1200\nrevolutions The density of the liquid at a temperature of 24° C The density of the liquid at a temperature of 24° C was\ntaken as 72, and as 1 volume of liquid gives 180 volumes of gas at a\npressure of\n2\n1\n2\n\n\natmospheres, we have\n101,760\n180\n =\n565 cu cm of liquid, or 407 grammes required for 1200 revolutions\nof the engines Thus, a theoretical calculation seemed to indicate that a\nkilogramme of liquid carbonic acid would be an ample supply for a\nrun of two minutes The experiments were, at first, somewhat\nencouraging The speed and apparent power of the engines were\nsufficient for the purpose, but the length of time during which power\ncould be obtained was limited In 1892, 415 grammes of carbonic acid drove the engines of\nAerodrome No 3 700 revolutions in 60 seconds, 900 in 75, and 1000\nin 85 seconds, at the end of which time the gas was entirely\nexpended The diameter of these cylinders was 2 4 cm , the stroke of\nthe pistons 7 cm , and the work done, that of driving a pair of 50 cm propellers, when taken in comparison with the propeller tests detailed\nelsewhere, amounted to an effective horse-power of about 0 10 for the\noutput of the engine",
    "10 for the\noutput of the engine The difficulties, however, that were experienced were those\npartially foreseen The expansion of the gas made such serious inroads\nupon the latent heat of the liquid, that lumps of solid acid were\nformed in the reservoir, and could be heard rattling against the sides\nwhen the latter was shaken, while the expansion of the exhaust\ncaused such a lowering of temperature at that point, that the [p029]\npipes were soon covered with a thick layer of ice, and the free exit of\nthe escaping gas was prevented Such difficulties are to be expected with this material, but here they\nwere enhanced by the small scale of the construction and the constant\ndemand for lightness And it was found to be very hard to fill the\nsmall reservoirs intended to carry the supply for the engines When\nthey were screwed to the large case in which the liquid was received\nand the whole inverted, the small reservoir would be filled from one-\nthird to one-half full, and nothing that could be done would force any\nmore liquid to enter In view of these difficulties, and the objections to using a heater of\nany sort for the gas, as well as the absolute lack of success attendant\n\n\nupon the experiments of others who were attempting to use liquid\nCO2 as a motive power on a large scale elsewhere, experiments were\nat first temporarily and afterwards permanently abandoned The above experiments extended over nearly a year in time, chiefly\nduring 1892, and involved the construction and use of the small\naerodromes Nos 1, 2, and 3, presently described ◊\n[p030]\nCHAPTER IV\nEARLY STEAM MOTORS AND OTHER MODELS\nIn dealing with the development of the aerodrome, subsequent to\nthe early rubber-driven models, the very considerable work done and\nthe failures incurred with other types of motors than steam, have been\nbriefly dealt with in the preceding chapter, but are scarcely\nmentioned here, as no attempts at long flights were ever successful\nwith any other motor than steam, and no information was gained\nfrom any of the experiments made with compressed air, gas, carbonic\nacid, or electricity, that was of much value in the development of the\nsuccessful steam machines In November, 1891, after the long and unsatisfactory experiments\nwith rubber-driven models already referred to, and before most of the\nexperiments with other available motors than steam had been made, I\ncommenced the construction of the engines and the design of the hull\nof a steam-driven aerodrome, which was intended to supplement the\nexperiments given in “Aerodynamics” by others made under the\nconditions of actual flight In designing this first aerodrome, here called No 0, there was no\nprecedent or example, and except for the purely theoretical conditions\nascertained by the experiments described in “Aerodynamics,”\neverything was unknown Next to nothing was known as to the size or\nform, as to the requisite strength, or as to the way of attaching the\nsustaining surfaces; almost nothing was known as to the weight\npermissible, and nothing as to the proper scale on which to build the\naerodrome, even if the design had been obtained, while everything\nwhich related to the actual construction of boiler and engines working\nunder such unprecedented conditions was yet to be determined by\nexperiment The scale of the actual construction was adopted under the belief\nthat it must be large enough to carry certain automatic steering\napparatus which I had designed, and which possessed considerable\nweight I decided that a flying machine if not large enough to carry a\nmanager, should in the absence of a human directing intelligence,\n\n\nhave some sort of automatic substitute for it, and be large enough to\nhave the means of maintaining a long and steady flight, during which\nthe problems (which the rubber-driven models so imperfectly\nanswered) could be effectually solved When, in 1891, it was decided to attempt to build this steam\naerodrome, the only engine that had been made up to that time with\nany claim to the lightness and power I was seeking, was the\nStringfellow engine, exhibited at the Crystal Palace in London, in\n1868, which it was then announced developed 1 horse-power [p031]\nfor a total weight (boiler and engines) of 13 pounds The original\nengine came into the possession of the Institution in 1889 as an\nhistorical curiosity, but on examination, it was at once evident that it\nnever had developed, and never could develop the power that had\nbeen attributed to it, and probably not one-tenth so much With the results obtained on the whirling-table at Allegheny as a\nbasis, a theoretical computation of the weight which 1 horse-power\nwould cause to soar showed that, with a plane whose efficiency\nshould be equal to that of a 30 × 4 8 inch plane set at an angle of 5°\nand moving at a speed of 34 miles an hour, 1 horse-power would\nsupport 120 pounds 19 With a smaller angle even better results could\nbe obtained, but as the difficulties of guidance increase as the angle\ndiminishes, I did not venture to aim at less than this In this\ncomputation, no allowance was made for the fact that these results\nwere obtained by a mechanism which forcibly maintained the\nsupporting surface in the ideal condition of the best attainable angle\nof attack as if in perfect equilibrium, and above all in the equally ideal\ncondition of perfectly horizontal flight Besides this, I had to consider in actual flight the air resistance due\nto the guy wires and hull, but after making an allowance of as much\nas three-quarters for these differences between the conditions of\nexperiment and those of free flight, I hoped that 1 horse-power would\nserve to carry 30 pounds through the air if a supporting surface as\nlarge as 3 feet to the pound could be provided, and this was the basis\nof the construction which I will now describe The general form of this Aerodrome No 0, without wings or\npropellers, is shown in the accompanying photograph in Plate 10 Its\ndimensions and its weights, as first designed, and as finally found\n\n\nnecessary, are as follows:\nCOMPARISON OF ESTIMATED AND\nACTUAL WEIGHTS OF PARTS OF\nAERODROME “0”—IN POUNDS AND\nOUNCES Estimated\nActual\nlbs oz lbs oz Engines\n4\n0\n4\n1\nBoilers and Burners\n8\n11\n13\n14\nPumps and Attachments\n0\n0\n1\n10\nSteering Apparatus\n0\n6\n0\n0\nFrame of Hull and Braces, including\nbowsprit and tail tube\n7\n7\n8\n11\nOil tank covering and pipes\n0\n0\n0\n13\nShafts, ball bearings (2:1) and wooden\npropellers (1:7)\n1\n14\n3\n8\nWings (5:4) and guys (0:9)\n4\n0\n5\n13\nTail\n1\n5\n2\n2\nJacket at prow\n0\n0\n4\n0\nTotal without oil or water\n27\n11\n44\n8\n(The weights attained in the actual making were, as is seen, nearly\ndouble those first estimated, and this constant increase of weight\nunder the exigencies of construction was a feature which could never\nbe wholly eliminated ) [p032]\nAfter studying various forms for the hull or body of the prospective\naerodrome, I was led to adopt the lines which Nature has used in the\nmackerel as most advantageous so far as the resistance of the air was\nconcerned, but it proved to be difficult in construction to make the\nlines of the bow materially different from those of the stern, and in\nthis first model the figure was symmetrical throughout As I wish that my experience may be of benefit to the reader, even\nin its failures, I will add that I made the not unnatural mistake of\nbuilding on the plan on which the hull of an ordinary ship is\nconstructed; that is, making the hull support the projecting bowsprit\nand other parts In the aerodrome, what corresponds to the bowsprit\nmust project far in advance of the hull to sustain the front wings, and\na like piece must project behind it to sustain the rear wings and the\ntail, or the supporting surfaces of whatever kind The mistake of the\nconstruction lay in disjoining these two and connecting them\nindirectly by the insufficiently strong hull which supported them This\nhull was formed of longitudinal U-shaped ribs of thin steel, which\n\n\nrested on rings made of an alloy of aluminum, which possessed the\nlightness of the latter metal with very considerable toughness, but\nwhich was finally unsatisfactory I may say parenthetically that in\nnone of the subsequent constructions has the lightness of aluminum\nbeen found to compensate for its very many disadvantages The two\nrods, which were each 1 metre in length, were with difficulty kept\nrigorously in line, owing to the yielding of the constructionally weak\nhull It would have been better, in fact, to have carried the rod\nstraight through at any inconvenience to the disposition of the boilers\nand the engine",
    "It would have been better, in fact, to have carried the rod\nstraight through at any inconvenience to the disposition of the boilers\nand the engine PL 10 STEEL FRAMES OF AERODROMES\nNOS 0, 1, 2, 3, 1891 AND 1892\n◊\nI may add that the sustaining surfaces, which were to be nearly flat\nwings, composed of silk stretched from a steel tube with wooden\nattachments, were to [p033] have been carried on the front rod, but, as\nsubsequent experience has shown, these wings would have been\ninadequate to the work, both from their insufficient size and their lack\nof rigidity The propellers, which were to be 80 cm in diameter, 1 25 pitch-\nratio, and which were expected to make from five to six hundred\nrevolutions a minute, were carried on the end of long tubular shafts,\nnot parallel, but making with each other an angle of 25 degrees, and\nunited by gears near the bow of the vessel in the manner shown in\nPlate 10 The first engines were of the oscillating type, with the piston-rod\nconnected directly to the crank; were very light, and were unprovided\nwith many of the usual fittings belonging to a steam engine, such as\nrod or piston packing; and their construction was crude in comparison\nwith their successors They were tested with the Prony brake and\nfound to be deficient in power, for with a steam pressure of 80 pounds\nto the square inch, they ran at the rate of 1170 revolutions per\nminute, and developed only 363 horse-power It soon became evident\nthat they were too light for the work that it was intended that they\nshould do, and steps were taken, even before the completion of these\ntests, for the construction of a pair of more powerful cylinders, which\n\n\nshould also be provided with a special boiler for the generation of the\nsteam Acting upon the supposition, in a saving of steam, it was\ndecided to work with compounded cylinders As two propellers were\nto be used, they were each fitted with a distinct pair of cylinders\nworking directly upon the shaft, but so connected by gearing that they\nwere compelled to turn at the same rate of speed The cylinders were of the inverted oscillating type, like the first pair\nof engines, but, unlike them, they were single-acting The dimensions\nwere: diameter of high-pressure cylinder 1 25 inches; low pressure,\n1 94 inches, with a common stroke of 2 inches, and with cranks set\nopposite to each other so that one cylinder was always at work The\ncylinders were held at their upper ends by a strap passing around a\nhollow conical trunk, which served the double purpose of a support\nfor the cylinders and an intermediate receiver between them This\nreceiver had a mean inside diameter of 1 25 inches, with a length of\n4 75 inches, so that it had about twice the cubical capacity of the\nhigh-pressure cylinder, while the displacement of the low-pressure\ncylinder was about 2 5 times that of the high; ratios that would have\ngiven satisfactory results, perhaps, had the steam pressure and other\nconditions been favorable to the use of the compound principle in this\nplace There were no valves for the admission of the steam, for,\ninasmuch as the engines were single-acting, it was possible to make\nports in the cylinder-head act as the admission and exhaust ports as\nthe cylinder oscillated, and thus avoid the complication and weight of\neccentric and valves [p034]\nThese cylinders were set in a light frame at an angle of 25° with\neach other, or 12 5° with the median line of the aerodrome, and drove\nthe long propeller shafts as shown in Plate 10, No 0",
    "0 At the extreme\nforward end of the crank-shafts there was a pair of intermeshing bevel\ngears which served to maintain the rate of revolution of the two\npropellers the same FIG 3 Boilers in use in 1891–1892 The boiler built for this work was a beehive-shaped arrangement of\ncoils of pipe It consisted at first, as shown in Fig 3, of three double\n\n\ncoils of\n3\n8\n-inch\ncopper pipe coiled up in the shape of a truncated cone, carrying in the\ncentral portion a pear-shaped receiver into the upper portion of which\nthe water circulating through the coils discharged Each of these\nreceivers was connected at the top with the bottom of a long\ncylindrical drum, with hemispherical ends, which formed a steam\nspace from which supply for the engines was drawn The lower ends\nof the coils were connected with an injection pipe supplying the\nwater Each “beehive” had 23 turns of tubing, and had a base of 7 5\ninches and a top diameter of 6 inches, the steam drum being 2 5\ninches in diameter I may here say that in the selection of the general\ntype of boiler for the work to be done, there was never any hesitation\nregarding the use of the water-tube variety Their superiority for the\nquick generation of large volumes of steam had been so pronounced\nthat nothing else seemed capable of competing with [p035] them in\nthis respect, regardless of the absolute economy of fuel that might or\nmight not be exhibited Hence, to the end of my experiments nothing\nelse was used Even before the “beehive” boiler was completed, I was anxious to\nascertain what could be done with a coil of pipe with a stream of\nwater circulating through it, as well as with various forms of burners,\nfor I realized that the success of the apparatus depended not only\nupon getting an exceedingly effective heating surface, but also an\nequally effective flame to do the heating For fuel I naturally turned to the liquids as being more compact and\nreadily regulated Whether to use some of the more volatile\nhydrocarbons or alcohol, was still an unsolved problem, but my\nopinion at the time was that, on the limited scale of the model, better\nresults could probably be obtained with alcohol In the experiments made with a coil preliminary to the trial of the\n“beehive” boiler, I tried a simple horizontal coil of\n3\n8\n-inch\ncopper pipe into which two forked burners working on the Bunsen\nprinciple and using city illuminating gas, were thrust The jets were\n\n\nabout\n1\n2\ninch apart The arrangement primed so badly that the engines could\nnot get rid of the entrained water, and would only make a few turns I then tried the same coil with two 1 25-inch drums in the inside\nand with five longitudinal water tubes at the bottom, beneath which\nwere the same two forked burners used in the previous experiment The coils were covered with a sheet of asbestos, and two round\nburners were added This boiler would hold a steam pressure of about\n15 pounds and run the engine slowly; but if the pressure were allowed\nto rise to 60 pounds, the engine would drive a 2-foot propeller of 18-\ninch pitch at the rate of about 650 turns per minute for from 80 to 90\nseconds, while the steam ran down to 10 pounds, showing that this\nboiler, at least, was too small This was further shown in a trial of the\nplain coil made in October, 1891; 6 pounds of water were evaporated\nin 32 minutes under a pressure of 60 pounds This was at the rate of\n11 25 pounds per hour, or, taking the U S Centennial standard of 30\npounds of evaporation per horse-power, gave an available output of\nless than\n1\n3\nhorse-power With these results before me, I decided to make a trial of the\n“beehive” principle upon a smaller scale than in the boiler designed\nfor Aerodrome No 0 I used a small boiler of which the inner coil\nconsisted of 8 turns of\n3\n8\n-inch\ncopper tube about 28 gauge thick, and the outer coil of 11 turns of\n1\n4\n-inch\ncopper pipe This gave 12 feet of\n3\n8\n-inch,\nand 16 feet of\n1\n4\n-inch\n\n\ntubing The drum was of No 27 gauge, hard planished copper With\nthis boiler consuming 6 oz of fuel, 80 3 oz of water were evaporated\nin 28 minutes, or at the rate of about 10 75 pounds per hour",
    "75 pounds per hour As these\ncoils contained but 2 22 square feet of heating surface, and as the\nthree to be built would contain 3 7 square feet each, it was estimated\nthe [p036] 10 square feet afforded by them could safely be depended\nupon to provide steam for a 1 horse-power engine As far as fuel\nconsumption was concerned, the rate of evaporation was about 15 6\npounds of water per pound of gasoline, all of which was satisfactory The burner originally designed for use in connection with the\n“beehive” boilers, consisted of a small tank in which a quantity of\ngasoline was placed, the space above being filled with compressed air Rising from the bottom of this tank was a small pipe coiling back and\ndown and ending in an upturned jet from which the gas generated in\nthe coil would issue The burner thus served to generate its own gas\nand act as a heater for the boilers at the same time The burner thus served to generate its own gas\nand act as a heater for the boilers at the same time In the construction of Aerodrome No 0, four of the “beehive” coils\nwere placed in a line fore and aft The fuel tank was located\nimmediately back of the rear coil and consisted of a copper cylinder\n11 cm in diameter and 9 cm long The engines were placed\nimmediately in front of the coils, all the apparatus being enclosed in a\nlight framing, as shown in the photograph (Plate 10) Extending front and back from the hull were the tubes for\nsupporting the wings and tail, each one metre in length The cross-\nframing for carrying the propeller shafts was built of tubing 1 5 cm diameter, and the shafts themselves were of the same size The ribs of\nthe hull were rings made of angle-irons measuring 1 50 × 1 75 cm ,\nwhich were held in place longitudinally by five 0 7 cm channel bars",
    "channel bars As it had been learned in the preliminary experiments with the\nmodel “beehive” boiler that the heated water would not of itself cause\na sufficiently rapid circulation to be maintained through the tubes to\nprevent them from becoming red-hot, two circulating pumps were\nadded for forcing the water through the coils of the two forward and\ntwo rear boilers respectively, the water being taken from the lower\nside of the drum and delivered into the bottom of the coils, which\nwere united at that point for the purpose A worm was placed upon\neach of the propeller shafts, just back of the engines, meshing in with\n\n\na gear on a crank-shaft from which the pumps were driven This shaft\nrotated at the rate of 1 to 24, so that for 1200 revolutions of the\nengine, it would make but 50, driving a single-acting plunger 1 2 cm in diameter and 2 cm stroke Apparently all was going well until I began to try the apparatus First, there was a difficulty with the burner, which could not be made\nto give forth the relative amount of heat that had been obtained from\nthe smaller model, and steam could not be maintained With one\n“beehive” connected with the compound engine, and a 70 cm propeller on the shaft, there were about 250 turns per minute for a\nspace of about 50 seconds, in which time the steam would fall from\n90 pounds to 25 pounds, and the engine would stop Then, as we had\nno air-chamber on the pumps at the time, they would not drive the\nwater through the coils Subsequent experiments, however, showed\nthat the boilers could be [p037] depended upon to supply the steam\nthat the compound engines would require; but after the whole was\ncompleted, the weight, if nothing else, was prohibitory I had gone on from one thing to another, adding a little here and a\nlittle there, strengthening this part and that, until when the hull was\nfinally completed with the engines and boilers in place, ready for the\napplication of the wings, the weight of the whole was found (allowing\n7 pounds for the weight of the wings and tail) to be almost exactly 45\npounds, and nearly 52 pounds with fuel and water To this excessive\nweight would have to be added that of the propellers, and as the\nwings would necessarily have to be made very large in order to carry\nthe machine, and as the difficulties of launching had still to be met,\nnothing was attempted in the way of field trials, and with great\ndisappointment the decision was made in May, 1892 (wisely, as it\nsubsequently appeared) to proceed no further with this special\napparatus However, inasmuch as this aerodrome with its engines and boilers\nhad been completed at considerable expense, it was decided to use the\napparatus as far as it might be practicable, in order to learn what\nmust be done to secure a greater amount of success in the future The\nfundamental trouble was to get heat In the first place there was\ntrouble with the burners, for it seemed to be impossible to get one\nthat would vaporize the gasoline in sufficient quantity to do the work,\n\n\nand various forms were successively tried All of the early part of 1892 was passed in trying to get the boilers\nto work at a steam pressure of 100 pounds per square inch On\naccount of the defects in the tubes and elsewhere this required much\npatient labor The writer, even thus early, devised a plan of using a\nsort of aeolipile, which should actuate its own blast, but this had to be\nabandoned on account of the fact that the pear-shaped receivers\nwould not stand the heat This necessitated a number of experiments\nin the distillation of gas, in the course of which there was trouble with\nthe pumps, and a continual series of breakages and leakages, so that\nthe middle of April came before I had secured any further satisfaction\nthan to demonstrate that possibly the boilers might have a capacity\nsufficient for the work laid out for them to do; but subsequent\nexperiments showed that even in this I was mistaken, for it was only\nafter additional jets had been put in between the coils that I\nsucceeded in getting an effective horse-power of 0 43 out of the\ncombination Finally, on the 14th of April, after having reduced the capacity of\nthe pumps to the dimensions given above (for the stroke was\noriginally 1 25 inch) I obtained the development of 1 full horse-power\nby the engine for 41 seconds, with a steam pressure of 100 pounds per\nsquare inch, and a rate of revolution of 720 per minute But at the end\nof this brief period, the shafts sprung and the worm was thrown out of\ngear [p038]\nI pass over numerous other experiments, for their only result was to\nmake it clear that the aerodrome, as it had been constructed, could\nnot be made to work efficiently, even if its great weight had not\nserved as a bar to its flight It was, therefore, decided to proceed with\nthe construction of another After the failure of the first steam-driven model No 0, which has\njust been described, subsequent light models were constructed These,\nthree in number, made with a view to the employment of carbonic\nacid or compressed air, but also to the possible use of steam, are\nshown in Plate 10, Nos 1, 2, 3; on the same scale as the larger model\nwhich had preceded them In describing these, it will be well to\nmention constructive features which were experimented on in them,\nas well as to describe the engines used",

    "Instead of\nthe oscillatory engines used up to this time, two stationary cylinder\nengines, each 2 4 cm in diameter and 4 cm stroke, having a\ncombined capacity of 36 cu cm cm without cut-off were employed for\ndriving the propellers The engines, though occasionally run in trials\nwith steam from a stationary boiler, were intended to be actuated\neither by compressed air or carbonic-acid gas contained in a reservoir\nwhich was not actually constructed, but whose weight was\nprovisionally estimated at 1 kilogramme The weight of the\n\n\naerodrome without this reservoir was but 1050 grammes, including\nthe estimated weight of the sustaining surfaces, which consisted\nprincipally of two wings, each about 1 metre in length by 30 cm in\nbreadth and which were in fact so slight in their construction, that it\nis now certain that they could not have retained their shape in actual\nflight The only trials made with this aerodrome, then, were in the shop, of\nwhich it is sufficient to cite those of November 22, 1892, when under\na pressure of 30 pounds, the maximum which the engines would bear,\ntwo 50 cm propellers were driven at 900 revolutions per minute,\nwith an estimated horse-power of 0 07, about 35 per cent of the\nweight of the whole machine being lifted This was a much more\nencouraging result than any which had preceded, and indicated that it\nwas possible to make an actual flight with the aerodrome if the boilers\ncould be ignored, the best result having been obtained only with\ncarbonic acid supplied without limit from a neighboring ample\nreservoir This aerodrome was also tested while mounted upon a whirling-arm\nand allowed to operate during its advance through the air The\nconclusion reached with it at the close of 1892, after a large part of\nthe year passed in experiments with carbonic-acid gas and compressed\nair, was that it was necessary to revert to steam, and that whatever\ndifficulties lay in the way, some means must be found of getting\nsufficient power without the weight which had proved prohibitory in\nNo 0",
    "0 With this chapter, then, and with the end of the year 1892, I close\nthis very brief account of between one and two years of fruitless\nexperiment in the construction of models supplied with various\nmotors, subsequent to and on a larger scale indeed than the toy-like\nones of india rubber, but not even so efficient as those had been, since\nthey had never procured a single actual flight ◊\n[p041]\nCHAPTER V\nON SUSTAINING SURFACES\nThe following general considerations may conveniently precede the\nparticular description of the balancing of the aerodrome In “Experiments in Aerodynamics,” I have given the result of trials,\nshowing that the pressure (or total resistance) of a wind on a surface 1\nfoot square, moving normally at the velocity of 1 foot per second, is\n0 00166 pounds, and that this pressure increases directly as the\nsurface of the plane, and (within our experimental condition) as the\nsquare of the velocity,20 results in general accordance with those of\nearlier observers I have further shown by independent investigations that while the\nshape of the plane is of secondary importance if its movement be\nnormal, the shape and “aspect” greatly affect the resultant pressure\nwhen the plane is inclined at a small angle, and propelled by such a\nforce that its flight is horizontal, that is, under the actual conditions of\nsoaring flight I have given on page 60 of “Aerodynamics,” the primary equations,\nPα = P90F(α) = kAV2F(α),\nW = Pα cos α = kAV2F(α) cos α,\nR = Pα sin α = kAV2F(α) sin α,\nwhere W is the weight of the plane under examination (sometimes\ncalled the “lift”); R the horizontal component of pressure (sometimes\ncalled the “drift”); k is the constant already given; A the area in\nsquare feet; V the velocity in feet per second; F a function of α (to be\ndetermined by experiment); α the angle which, under these\nconditions, gives horizontal flight I have also given on page 66 of the same work the following table\nshowing the actual values obtained by experiment on a plane, 30 ×\n4 8 inches (= 1 sq ft ), weighing 500 grammes (1 1 pounds):\nAngle\nwith\nhorizon\nα Soaring\nspeed\nV Horiz-\nontal\npres-\nsure R Work\nexpended\nper\nminute\n60 RV Weight with planes of\nlike form that 1 horse-\npower will drive\nthrough the air at\nvelocity V Metres\nper sec Feet per\nsec Gm Kgm-\nmetres Foot-pounds Kgm Pounds 45°\n11 2\n36 7\n500\n336\n2,434\n6 8\n15\n30 \n10 6\n34 8\n275\n175\n1,268\n13 0\n29\n15 \n11 2\n36 7\n128\n86\n623\n26 5\n58\n10 \n12 4\n40 7\n88\n65\n474\n34 8\n77\n5 \n15 2\n49 8\n45\n41\n297\n55 5\n122\n2 \n20 0\n65 6\n20\n24\n174\n95 0\n209\n[p042]\nIt cannot be too clearly kept in mind that these values refer to\nhorizontal flight, and that for this the weight, the work, the area, the\nangle and the velocity are inseparably connected by the formulæ\nalready given It is to be constantly remembered also, that they apply to results\nobtained under almost perfect theoretical conditions as regards not\nonly the maintenance of equilibrium and horizontality, but also the\nrigid maintenance of the angle α and the comparative absence of\nfriction, and that these conditions are especially “theoretical” in their\nexclusion of the internal work of the wind observable in experiments\nmade in the open wind EXPERIMENTS\nIN THE\nOPEN\nWIND\nI have pointed out21 that an indefinite source of power for the\nmaintenance of mechanical flight, lies in what I have called the\n“internal work” of the wind It is easy to see that the actual effect of\nthe free wind, which is filled with almost infinitely numerous and\nincessant changes of velocity and direction, must differ widely from\nthat of a uniform wind such as mathematicians and physicists have\nalmost invariably contemplated in their discussions Now the artificial wind produced by the whirling-table differs from\nthe real wind not only in being caused by the advancing object, whose\ndirection is not strictly linear, and in other comparatively negligible\nparticulars, but especially in this, that in spite of little artificial\ncurrents the movement on the whole is regular and uniform to a\ndegree strikingly in contrast with that of the open wind in nature In a note to the French edition of my work, I have called the\nattention of the reader to the fact that the figures given in the\nSmithsonian publication can show only a small part of the virtual\n\n\nwork of the wind, while the plane, which is used for simplicity of\nexposition, is not the most advantageous form for flight; so that, as I\ngo on to state, the realization of the actually successful aerodrome\nmust take account of the more complex conditions actually existing in\nnature, which were only alluded to in the memoir, whose object was\nto bring to attention the little considered importance of the then\nalmost unobserved and unstudied minute fluctuations which\nconstitute the internal work of the wind I added that I might later\npublish some experimental investigations on the superior efficiency of\nthe real wind over that artificially created The experiments which\nwere thus alluded to in 1893, were sufficient to indicate the\nimportance of the subject, but the data have not been preserved What immediately follows refers, it will be observed, more\nparticularly to the work of the whirling-table [p043]\nRELATION\nOF\nAREA\nTO\nWEIGHT\nAND\nPOWER\nIn order to get a more precise idea of the character of the alteration\nintroduced into these theoretical conditions by the variation of any of\nthem, let us, still confining ourselves to the use of the whirling-table,\nsuppose that the plane in question while possessing the same weight,\nshape, and angle of inclination, were to have its area increased, and to\nfix our ideas, we will suppose that it became 4 square feet instead of 1\nas before Then, from what has already been said, V, the velocity,\nmust vary inversely as the square root of the area; that is, it must,\nunder the given condition, become one-half of what it had been, for if\nV did not alter, the impelling force continuing the same, the plane\nwould rise and its flight no longer be horizontal, unless the weight,\nnow supposed to be constant, were itself increased so as to restore\nhorizontality I have repeated Table XIII under the condition that the area be\nquadrupled, while all the other conditions remain constant, except the\nsoaring speed, which must vary α\nSoaring speed (feet\nper second)\nV′",

III If W is constant while A\nvaries, the weight which 1 H If W is constant while A\nvaries, the weight which 1 H P will support varies as √A The reader is reminded that these are simply deductions from the\nequations given in “Aerodynamics,” and that these deductions have\nnot been verified by direct trial, such as would show that no new\nconditions have in fact been introduced in this new application While, however, these deductions cannot convey any confidence\nbeyond what is warranted by the original experiments, in their\ngeneral trustworthiness as working formulæ at this stage of the\ninvestigations, we may, I think, feel confidence I may, in view of its importance, repeat my remark that the relation\nof area and weight which obtain in practice, will depend upon yet\nother than these theoretical considerations, for, as the flight of the\nfree aerodrome cannot be expected to be exactly horizontal nor\nmaintained at any constant small angle, the \n[p044] data of\n“Aerodynamics” (obtained in constrained horizontal flight with the\nwhirling-table) are here insufficient They are insufficient also because\n\n\nthese values are obtained with small rigid planes, while the surfaces\nwe are now to use cannot be made rigid under the necessary\nrequirements of weight, without the use of guy wires and other\nadjuncts which introduce head resistance Against all these unfavorable conditions we have the favoring one\nthat, other things being equal, somewhat more efficiency can be\nobtained with suitable curved surfaces than with planes 22\nI have made numerous experiments with curves of various forms\nupon the whirling-table, and constructed many such supporting\nsurfaces, some of which have been tested in actual flight It might be\nexpected that fuller results from these experiments should be given\nthan those now presented here, but I am not yet prepared to offer any\nmore detailed evidence at present for the performance of curved\nsurfaces than will be found in Part III 23 I do not question that curves\nare in some degree more efficient, but the extreme increase of\nefficiency in curves over planes understood to be asserted by\nLilienthal and by Wellner, appears to have been associated either with\nsome imperfect enunciation of conditions which gave little more than\nan apparent advantage, or with conditions nearly impossible for us to\nobtain in actual flight All these circumstances considered, we may anticipate that the\npower required (or the proportion of supporting area to weight) will\nbe very much greater in actual than in theoretical (that is, in\nconstrained horizontal) flight, and the early experiments with rubber-\ndriven models were in fact successful only when there were from\nthree to four feet of sustaining surface to a pound of weight When\nsuch a relatively large area is sought in a large aerodrome, the\nconstruction of light, yet rigid, supporting surfaces becomes a nearly\ninsuperable difficulty, and this must be remembered as consequently\naffecting the question of the construction of boiler, engines and hulls,\nwhose weight cannot be increased without increasing the wing area ◊\n[p045]\nCHAPTER VI\nBALANCING THE AERODROME\nBy “balancing” I mean such an adjustment of the mean center of\npressure of the supporting surfaces with reference to the center of\ngravity and to the line of thrust, that for a given speed the aerodrome\nwill be in equilibrium, and will maintain steady horizontal flight “Balance” and “equilibrium” as here used are nearly convertible\nterms LATERAL\nSTABILITY\nEquilibrium may be considered with reference to lateral or\nlongitudinal stability The lateral part is approximately secured with\ncomparative ease, by imitating Nature’s plan, and setting the wings at\na diedral angle, which I have usually made 150° Stability in this sense\ncannot be secured in what at first seems an obvious way—by putting\na considerable weight in the central plane and far below the center of\ngravity of the aerodrome proper, for this introduces rolling Thence\nensues the necessity of carrying the center of gravity more nearly up\nto the center of pressure than would otherwise be necessary, and so\nfar introducing conditions which tend to instability, but which seem\nto be imposed upon us by the circumstances of actual flight With\nthese brief considerations concerning lateral stability, I pass on to the\nfar more difficult subject of longitudinal stability LONGITUDINAL\nSTABILITY\nMy most primitive observation with small gliding models was of the\nfact that greater stability was obtained with two pairs of wings, one\nbehind the other, than with one pair (greater, that is, in the absence\nof any instinctive power of adjustment) This is connected with the fact that the upward pressure of the air\nupon both pairs may be resolved into a single point which I will call\nthe “center of pressure,” and which, in stable flight, should (apart\nfrom the disturbance by the propeller thrust) be over the center of\n\n\ngravity The center of pressure in an advancing inclined plane in\nsoaring flight is, as I have shown in “Aerodynamics,” and as is\notherwise well known, always in advance of the center of figure, and\nmoves forward as the angle of inclination of the sustaining surfaces\ndiminishes, and, to a less extent, as horizontal flight increases in\nvelocity These facts furnish the elementary ideas necessary in\ndiscussing this problem of equilibrium, whose solution is of the most\nvital importance in successful flight [p046]\nThe solution would be comparatively simple if the position of the\nCP could be accurately known beforehand, but how difficult the\nsolution is may be realized from a consideration of one of the facts\njust stated, namely, that the position of the center of pressure in\nhorizontal flight shifts with the velocity of the flight itself, much as\nthough in marine navigation the trim of a steamboat’s hull were to be\ncompletely altered at every change of speed It may be remarked here\nthat the center of pressure, from the symmetry of the aerodrome,\nnecessarily lies in the vertical medial plane, but it may be considered\nwith reference to its position either in the plane XY (cp1) or in the\nplane YZ (cp2) The latter center of pressure, as referred to in the\nplane YZ, is here approximately calculated on the assumption that it\nlies in the intersection of this vertical plane by a horizontal one\npassing through the wings half way from root to tip Experiments made in Washington, later than those given in\n“Aerodynamics,” show that the center of pressure, (cp1) on a plane at\nslight angles of inclination, may be at least as far forward as one-sixth\nthe width from the front edge From these later experiments it appears\nprobable also that the center of pressure moves forward for an\nincreased speed even when there has been no perceptible diminution\nof the angle of the plane with the horizon, but these considerations\nare of little value as applied to curved wings such as are here used Some observations of a very general nature may, however, be made\nwith regard to the position of the wings and tail In the case where there are two pairs of wings, one following the\nother, the rear pair is less efficient in an indefinite degree than the\nfront, but the action of the wings is greatly modified by their position\nwith reference to the propellers, and from so many other causes, that,\nas a result of a great deal of experiment, it seems almost impossible at\n\n\nthis time to lay down any absolute rule with regard to the center of\npressure of any pair of curved wings used in practice Later experiments conducted under my direction by Mr E C Huffaker, some of which will appear in Part III, indicate that upon the\ncurved surfaces I employed, the center of pressure moves forward\nwith an increase in the (small) angle of elevation, and backward with\na decrease, so that it may lie even behind the center of the surface Since for some surfaces the center of pressure moves backward, and\nfor others forward, it would seem that there might be some other\nsurface for which it will be fixed Such a surface in fact appears to\nexist in the wing of the soaring bird These experiments have been\nchiefly with rigid surfaces, and though some have been made with\nelastic rear surfaces, these have not been carried far enough to give\npositive results The curved wings used on the aerodromes in late years have a rise\nof one in twelve, or in some cases of one in eighteen,24 and for these\nlatter the following empirical local rule has been adopted: [p047]\nThe center of pressure on each wing with a horizontal motion of 2000\nfeet per minute, is two-fifths of the distance from front to rear Where there\nare two pairs of wings of equal size, one following the other, and placed at\nsuch a distance apart and with such a relation to the propellers as here\nused, the following wing is assumed to have two-thirds of the efficiency of\nthe leader per unit of surface If it is half the size of the leader, the\nefficiency is assumed to be one-half per unit of surface If it is half as large\nagain as the leader, its efficiency is assumed to be eight-tenths per unit of\nsurface For intermediate sizes of following wing, intermediate values of the\nefficiency may be assumed These rules are purely empirical and only approximate As\napproximations, they are useful in giving a preliminary balance, but\nthe exact position of the center of pressure is rarely determinable in\neither the horizontal or vertical plane, except by experiment in actual\nflight The position of the center of gravity is found with all needed\nprecision by suspending the aerodrome by a plumb-line in two\npositions, and noting the point of intersection of the traces of the line,\nand this method is so superior to that by calculation, that it will\nprobably continue in use even for much larger constructions than the\npresent The principal factor in the adjustment is the position of the wings\nwith reference to the center of gravity, but the aerodrome is moved\n\n\nforward by the thrust of its propellers, and we must next recall the\nfact of experiment that as it is for constructional reasons difficult to\nbring the thrust line in the plane of the center of pressure of the\nwings, it is in practice sufficiently below them to tend to tip the front\nof the aerodrome upward, so that it may be that equilibrium will be\nattained only when CP1 is not over CG1 In the discussion of the equilibrium, then, we must consider also the\neffect of thrust, and usually assume that this thrust-line is at some\nappreciable distance below the center of pressure We may conveniently consider two cases:\n1 That the center of pressure is not directly over the center of\ngravity; that is, CG1−CP1 = a, and estimate what the value of a\nshould be in order that, during horizontal flight, the aerodrome itself\nshall be horizontal; or, [p048]\n2 Consider that the center of pressure is directly over the center of\ngravity (CP1−CG1 = 0), and in this case inquire what angle the\naerodrome itself may take during horizontal flight First case The diagram (Fig 4) represents the resultants of the\nseparate system of forces acting on the aerodrome, and these\nresultants will lie in a vertical medial plane from the symmetry of\ntheir disposition Let af represent the resultant of the vertical components of the\npressure on the wings; the

but now let there be added a flat tail\nAC set at an angle −α with the wing This tail serves simply for\ndirection, and not for the support of the aerodrome, which, as already\nstated, is balanced so that the CG comes under the CP of the wing Bb It will be seen on a simple inspection that the tail under the given\nconditions is horizontal, and that, presenting its edge to the wind of\nadvance, it offers no resistance to it, so that if the front rises and the\nangle α increases, the wind will strike on the under side of the tail\nand thereby tend to raise the rear and depress [p051] the front again If\nthe angle α diminish, so that the front drops, the wind will strike the\nupper surface of the tail, and equally restore the angle α to the\namount which is requisite to give horizontal flight If the angle α is\nnot chosen originally with reference to the speed so as to give\nhorizontal flight, the device will still tend to continue the flight in the\nstraight line which the conditions impose, whether that be horizontal\nor not From this description of its action, it will be seen that the Pénaud\ntail has the disadvantage of giving an undulatory flight, if the tail is\nmade rigid This objection, however, can be easily overcome by giving\nto it a certain amount of elasticity It does not appear that Pénaud\ngave much attention to this feature, but stress is laid upon it in the\narticle “Flight,” in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica,\nand I have introduced a simple device for securing it The complete success of the device implies a strictly uniform\nvelocity and other conditions which cannot well he fulfilled in\npractice Nevertheless, it is as efficient a contrivance for its object as\nhas yet been obtained More elaborate devices have been proposed, and a number of them,\ndepending for their efficiency upon the action of a variety of forces,\nhave been constructed by the writer, one of which will be described\nlater This has the advantage that it tends to secure absolutely\nhorizontal flight, but it is much inferior in simplicity to the Pénaud\ntail Apart from considerations about the thrust, the CP is in practice\nalways almost directly over the CG, and this relationship is, according\nto what has been suggested, obtained by moving the supporting\n\n\nsurfaces relatively to the CG, or vice versa, remembering, however,\nthat, as these surfaces have weight, any movement of them alters the\nCG of the whole, so that successive readjustments may be needed The\nadjustment is further complicated by another important consideration,\nnamely, that those parts which change their weight during flight (like\nthe water and the fuel) must be kept very near the CG As the water\nand fuel tanks are fixed, it appears, then, that the center of gravity of\nthe whole is practically fixed also, and this consideration makes the\nadjustment a much more difficult problem than it would be\notherwise 25\nPL 11 STEEL FRAMES OF AERODROMES\nNOS 4, 5, 6 1893, 1895 AND 1896\n◊\n\n\n\n\n◊\n[p053]\nCHAPTER VII\nHISTORY OF CONSTRUCTION OF FRAME AND ENGINES OF\nAERODROMES\nDuring the years 1892 and 1893, it will be recalled, four\naerodromes, known as Nos 0, 1, 2, and 3, had been built, which were\nof two general types of construction First, that represented by No 0,\nin which a radically weak hull was made to support rods at the front\nand rear, to which the wings and tail were attached This aerodrome\nwas abandoned on account of the inability to provide it with sufficient\npower, as well as because of its constructional weakness",
    "This aerodrome\nwas abandoned on account of the inability to provide it with sufficient\npower, as well as because of its constructional weakness Second, that\ntype represented by Nos 1, 2, and 3, in which a midrod was carried\nthrough from front to rear, around which the hull supporting the\nmachinery was built These models were much lighter than No 0, but\nwere all abandoned because it was found impossible to propel even\nthe lightest of them While all these machines were in the strictest\nsense failures, inasmuch as none of them was ever equipped with\nsupporting surfaces, yet the experience gained in the construction of\nthem was of the very greatest value in determining the points at\nwhich strength was needed, and in indicating the mode of\nconstruction by which strength and rigidity could be obtained 26\n1893\nAnother aerodrome, known as No 4 (shown in Plate 11), was\ndesigned in the latter part of 1892, and by the end of March, 1893, its\nconstruction was well under way It was of the second type, in that\nthe midrod was continuous, but it differed from the preceding forms\nin having the machinery (boilers, burners, and tanks) attached\ndirectly to the midrod, the hull now taking the form of a mere\nprotective sheathing It was of the second type, in that\nthe midrod was continuous, but it differed from the preceding forms\nin having the machinery (boilers, burners, and tanks) attached\ndirectly to the midrod, the hull now taking the form of a mere\nprotective sheathing As in Nos",
    "As in Nos 2 and 3, two engines were used,\nwhich were mounted on a cross-frame of light tubing attached to the\nmidrod at right angles It had, as at first constructed, no provision for\nthe generation of steam, but only for carrying a reservoir of carbonic\nacid to supply gas for the engines The whole, including wings, tail, and engines, but without the\n\n\ncarbonic acid reservoir, weighed 1898 grammes (4 18 lbs ) A\ncylindrical reservoir, weighing 521 grammes (1 14 lbs ) and capable\nof holding 1506 cu cm (92 cu in in ) was constructed for this purpose,\nand tested for 30 minutes with a pressure of 100 [p054] atmospheres If the weight of the cylinder, with its contents and adjuncts, be taken\nas 800 grammes (1 76 lbs ), the total weight of the aerodrome was\n2698 grammes (5 95 lbs ) The wings were plane surfaces of silk,\nstretched over a very light frame, with no intermediate ribs to prevent\nthe wing from being completely distorted by the upward pressure of\nthe air Even if they had been sufficiently strong and stiff, the total\nsurface of both wings and tail was but 2601 sq cm (2 8 sq ft ) or\napproximately 0 5 sq ft ft of supporting surface to the pound, much\nless than was found adequate, even under the most favorable\ncircumstances The weight was much more than had been\ncontemplated when the wings were designed, yet, if all the other\nfeatures of the aerodrome had been satisfactory, and sufficient power\nhad been secured, the work of providing suitable supporting surfaces\nwould have been attempted But as it was found that the engines\nwhen supplied with carbonic-acid gas were unable to develop\nanything like the power necessary to propel the aerodrome, and that\nthe construction could be greatly improved in many other ways, this\naerodrome was entirely rebuilt The work of the engines with carbonic\nacid had been so completely unsatisfactory that the idea was entirely\nabandoned, and no further attempts to develop an efficient motor\nother than steam were made It now became realized more completely than ever before that the\nprimary requisite was to secure sufficient power, and that this could\nbe obtained only by the use of steam This involved a number of\nproblems, all of which would have to be solved before any hope of a\nsuccessful machine could be entertained In the first place, engines of\nsufficient power and strength, but of the lightest possible construction,\nmust be built Second, a boiler must be constructed of the least\npossible weight, which would develop quickly and maintain steadily\nsteam at a high enough pressure to drive the engines This demanded\nsome form of heating apparatus, which could work under the adverse\ncondition of enclosure in a narrow hull, and steadily supply enough\nheat to develop the relatively large quantity of steam required by the\n\n\nengines The first of these problems, that of procuring suitable engines, was\nat least temporarily solved by the construction of two engines with\nbrass cylinders, which had a diameter of 2 4 cm (0 95 in ), and a\npiston stroke of 5 cm (1 97 in ) The valve was a simple slide-valve of\nthe piston type, arranged to cut off steam at one-half stroke No\npacking was used for the piston or the valve, which were turned to an\naccurate fit to the cylinder and the steam-chest respectively In the\nengines built up to this time, the parts had frequently been soldered\ntogether, and a great deal of trouble and delay had arisen from this\ncause In these new engines, however, as strong and careful a\nconstruction was made as was possible within the very narrow limits\nof weight, with the result that the engines, though by no means as\nefficient as those constructed later, were used in all the experiments of\n1893 and also during the first part of 1894 [p055]\nAs soon as these engines were completed, in February, 1893, a test\nwas made of one of the cylinders, steam being supplied from the\nboiler of the shop-engine The experiments were made with the Prony\nbrake, and showed that at a speed of 1000 revolutions per minute, the\npower developed from a single cylinder was 0 208 H P , with a mean\neffective pressure in the cylinder of only about 21 pounds per square\ninch of piston area, allowing a loss of 25 per cent for the internal\nresistance of the engine This pressure was so much less than should\nhave been obtained with the steam pressure used, that it now seems\nevident that the steam passages and ports were too small to admit and\nexhaust the steam with sufficient rapidity to do the work with the\nsame efficiency that is obtained in common practice This, however,\nwas not immediately recognized The piston speed at 1000 R P M",
    "M was 328 feet per minute, at which speed the steam at a pressure of 80\npounds should have been able to follow up the piston and maintain\nalmost, if not quite, full boiler pressure to the point of cut-off, but it\ndid not do so The problem of generating steam was much more difficult and\nrequired a long and tedious series of experiments, which consumed\nthe greater part of the year before any considerable degree of success\nhad been attained In the course of these experiments many\nunexpected difficulties were encountered, which necessitated the\n\n\nconstruction of special forms of apparatus, which will be described at\nthe proper point Numerous features of construction, which seemed to\nbe of value when first conceived, but which proved useless when\nrigorously tested, will be noted here, whenever a knowledge of their\nvaluelessness may seem to be of advantage to the reader The boiler was necessarily developed simultaneously with the\ndevelopment of the heating apparatus, and in the following pages, as\nfar as possible, they will be treated together; but often for the sake of\nclearness and to avoid repetition, separate treatment will be\nnecessary At the beginning of these experiments, there was much doubt as to\nwhether alcohol or gasoline would be found most suitable for the\nimmediate purpose An alcohol burner had been used in connection\nwith the earliest aerodrome, No 0, but from the results obtained with\nit at that time, there seemed to be little reason to hope for success\nwith it It is to be premised that the problem, which at first seemed\ninsoluble, was no less than to produce steam for something like 1 H P by a fire-grate, which should occupy only a few cubic inches (about\nthe size of a clenched hand) and weigh but a few ounces It had to be\nattacked, however, and as alcohol offered the great advantage of high\ncalorific properties with freedom from all danger of explosion, it was\nat first used Early in 1893, it occurred to me to modify the burner so as to make\nit essentially an aeolipile, and in April of that year the first\nexperimental aeolipile model shown at A (Plate 12) was made It was\nvery small and intended for the [p056] demonstration of a principle\nrather than for actual service, but the construction of this small\naeolipile was an epoch in the history of the aerodrome It furnished\nimmensely more heat than anything that had preceded it, and\nweighed so little and worked so well that in May the aeolipile marked\nB was made In this design two pipes were led from the upper portion\nof the cylinder, one to a large Bunsen burner which heated the boiler,\nthe other to a small burner placed under the tank to vaporize the\nalcohol This was followed by the one shown at C, wherein the\nheating burner was smaller and the gas pipe, leading to the main\nburner, larger Figures D, E, F, and G (Plate 12) were really continuations and\n\n\nimprovements of the same idea In C there was simply a tube or flue\nthrough the tank; in F, however, this tube discharged into a smoke-\nstack fastened to the end of the cylinder, while in G the flue turned\nupward within the tank itself and discharged into the short stack on\ntop The object of these changes was to increase the draft and heating\npower of the small flame, so that the gas would be more rapidly\ngenerated and a greater quantity be thus made available for use under\nthe boiler in a unit of time They were, however, though\nimprovements in a construction which was itself a great advance, still\ninadequate to give out a sufficient amount of heat to meet the\nexcessive demands of the required quantity of steam The boilers in\nconnection with which these aeolipiles were used must now be\nconsidered The first boiler E (Plate 13) made during this year was a double-coil\nboiler of the Serpollet type, formed of 19 feet of copper tubing having\nan internal diameter of about\n1\n8\ninch Attached to the boiler was a small vertical drum, from the top of\nwhich steam was led to the engine, a pipe from the bottom leading to\nthe pump This boiler was tested in April with an alcohol heater, the\npump in this trial being worked by hand This apparatus developed a\nsteam pressure varying from 25 to 75 pounds, which caused the\nengines to drive a 60 cm propeller of 1 25 pitch-ratio 565 revolutions\nper minute The greatest difficulty was experienced in securing a\nsufficient and uniform circulation in the boiler coils The action in the\npresent case was extremely irregular, as the pressure sometimes rose\nto 150 pounds, driving the engines at a dangerous speed and bending\nthe eccentric rod, while at other times it would fall so low that the\nengines stopped completely As the pump used in this trial had proved so unsatisfactory and\nunreliable, it was replaced by a reservoir of water having an air-\nchamber charged to 10 atmospheres, the flow from which could\napparently be regulated with the greatest nicety by a needle valve at\nthe point of egress; but for some reason its performance was\nunsatisfactory and remained so after weeks of experiment PL 12 BURNERS, AEOLIPILES, AND SEPARATORS ◊\n\n\nPL 13 BOILERS OF AERODROMES ◊\nThere was used in connection with this device the double-coil boiler\nshown at F (Plate 13) which was made of tubes flattened so as to be\nnearly capillary The idea of this was to obtain a larger heating\nsurface and a smaller volume of [p057] water, so that by proper\nregulation at the needle valve, just that quantity would be delivered\nwhich could be converted into steam in its passage through the coils,\nand be ready for use in the engines as it left the boiler at the farther\nextremity The results obtained from this were an improvement over\nthose from the original coil, and a third set of coils (G, in Plate 13)\nwas made This boiler consisted of three flattened tubes superposed\none over another These two boilers were tried by placing them in a charcoal fire and\nturning on an alcohol blast, while water from a reservoir under\nconstant air pressure was forced through them past a pin valve The\nresult was that the two-stranded coil supplied steam at from 10 to 40\npounds pressure to run the engines at about 400 revolutions per\nminute The pressure rose steadily for about 40 seconds and then\nsuddenly fell away, though the coils were red-hot, and neither the\nwater nor the alcohol was exhausted—apparently because of the\nirregularity of the supply of water, due to the time taken by it after\npassing the valve to fill the considerable space intervening between\nthat point and the boiler An attempt was made to overcome this difficulty by putting a stop-\ncock directly in front of the boiler so that the water, while still under\nthe control of the needle valve, could be turned in at once; the alcohol\nblast was also arranged to be turned on or off at pleasure, and\nprovision was made, by taking out the end of the flue inclosing the\nboiler, to provide for an increased air supply With this arrangement a\nflame eight or nine inches long was obtained, but a test showed that\nnot more than 25 grammes of water per minute passed through the\ntubes, which was not enough Further tests with these boilers were so far satisfactory as to show\nthat with the flattened-tube Serpollet boiler, comprising from 60 to 80\nfeet of tubing, from 80 to 100 pounds pressure of steam could be\nmaintained, but not steadily As there were difficulties in flattening\n\n\nthe tubes to make a boiler of this sort, a compromise was effected in\nthe construction of the one shown at H (Plate 13), which was made of\nlight copper tubes 5 mm in diameter, laid up in three lengths of 6\nmetres each The ends of these coils were so attached to each other\nthat the water entering at one end of the smallest coil would pass\nthrough it and then enter the middle coil, whence it passed through\nthe third or outer coil Two sets of these coils were made and placed\nin the thin sheathings shown in the photograph Repeated\nexperiments with these boilers demonstrated that the pressure did not\nrise high enough in proportion to the heat applied, and that even the\npressures obtained were irregular and untrustworthy The principal\ndifficulty still lay in maintaining an active and uniform circulation\nthrough the coils, and for this purpose the water reservoir under\nconstant air pressure had proved itself inadequate This pointed to a\nreturn to the use of the force pump, the construction of which had\nhitherto presented so many special difficulties that it had been\ntemporarily abandoned [p058]\nA further difficulty experienced in the use of these boilers had been\nthat of obtaining dry steam for the engines, as during the early\nexperiments the steam had been delivered directly into the engines\nfrom the boiler coils But in August the writer devised a chamber,\nknown as the “separator,” where it had an opportunity to separate\nfrom the water and issue as dry steam, or at least approximately dry\nsteam This was an arrangement familiar in principle to steam\nengineers under another form, but it was one of the many things\nwhich, in the ignorance of steam engineering the writer has already\nfreely admitted, he had to reinvent for himself At about the same time, a new pump was designed to drive the\nwater from the bottom of the separator, which served the double\npurpose of steam drum and reservoir, into the coils This pump had a\ndiameter of 4 8 cm , and was run at 180 strokes per minute The result of the first experiments with these improvements\ndemonstrated that, within certain limits, the amount of water\nevaporated is proportional to the circulation, and in this boiler the\ncirculation was still the thing that was at fault Finally, the results of\nthe experiments with the two-stranded, triple-coil boiler may be\nsummed up in the statement that it was possible to maintain a\n\n\npressure of 80 pounds, and that with it the engines could be made to\ndevelop from 0 3 to 0 4 H P at best It weighed 650 grammes (1 43\npounds) without the asbestos jacket",
    "43\npounds) without the asbestos jacket About this time the writer had the good fortune to secure the\ntemporary services of Dr Carl Barus, an accomplished physicist, with\nwhose aid a great variety of boilers were experimented on The next form of boiler tested was that shown at N (Plate 13), made\non a system of coils in parallel, of which there were twenty complete\nturns In the first test it generated but 20 pounds of steam, because\nthe flame refused to work in the colder coils The work of this boiler\nwas very unsatisfactory, and it was only with the greatest difficulty\nthat more than ten pounds pressure could be maintained There was\ntrouble, too, with the circulation, in that when the flame was in full\nplay the pump seemed to meet an almost solid resistance, so that it\ncould not be made to do its work A new boiler was accordingly made, consisting of three coils of four\nstrands each With this the pump worked easily, but whereas it was\nexpected to get 120 pounds pressure, the best that could be obtained\nwas 70 pounds The outer coil was then stripped off, and a trial made\nin which everything ran smoothly and the pressure mounted\nmomentarily to 90 pounds After some adjustment, a mean pressure of\n80 pounds was obtained, giving 730 revolutions of the engine per\nminute, with an indicated horse-power of 0 32 It was shown in this work that, within certain limits, steam is\ngenerated most rapidly when it is used most rapidly, so that two\nengines could be used [p059] almost as well as one, the reason\napparently being that the rapid circulation increased the steam\ngenerating power of the boiler, and that the engines worked best at\nabout 80 pounds It was also found that a larger tubing was better\nthan the small, weight for weight, this fact being due to the greater\nease with which circulation could be maintained, since fewer coils\nwere necessary in order to obtain the same external heating surface The pressure in the coils and the separator was also much more nearly\nequalized The result was that the boiler temporarily approved was\none made of tubing 6",
    "The result was that the boiler temporarily approved was\none made of tubing 6 35 mm (0 25 inch) in diameter, bent into a\ntwo-coil, two-stranded boiler, having sixteen complete turns for each\nstrand in each coil The total weight was 560 grammes (1 23 pounds)\n\n\nwith a total heating surface of 1300 sq cm (1 4 sq ft ) The separator used in the experiments made during August and\nSeptember was of a form in which the water was forced below a series\nof partitions that prevented it from following the steam over into the\ncylinders of the engines It weighed 410 grammes (0 9 pound) and\nwas most conveniently worked with 700 grammes (1 54 pounds) of\nwater The boiler and separator together weighed 970 grammes (2 1\npounds) 1\npounds) A new separator was, however, designed, which was horizontal\ninstead of vertical, as it was intended that it should be placed just\nbelow the midrod Another form, devised for constructional reasons,\nconsisted of a cylinder in which a pump was imbedded Heretofore\nthe pump used had been single-acting, but it was now proposed to\nmake a double-acting pump Upon testing this apparatus, it was found\nthat when using an aeolipile, it took 150 grammes of alcohol to\nevaporate 600 grammes of water It was evident that the latter was\nused very wastefully, so that the thermal efficiency of the engine was\nnot over one per cent; but it was also evident that, under the necessity\nof sacrificing everything to lightness, this waste was largely\ninevitable About the middle of October, another boiler (O, Plate 13) was\nmade, which consisted of two coils wound in right and left hand\nscrew-threads, one fitting loosely over the other, so as to make a\ncylindrical lattice-work 32 cm (12 6 in ) long Each coil contained\ntwo strands of copper tube 0 3 mm thick, and weighing 54 grammes\nto the metre (0 036 pound to the foot) The inner coil had a diameter\nof 5 63 cm (2 22 in ), with nine turns of tube to the strand, the two\nstrands making a length of 319 cm (10 5 feet) for the coil The outer\ncoil had a mean diameter of 6 88 cm (2 71 in ) and a length of 388\ncm (12 7 feet) for the two strands The total length of the two coils\nwas, therefore, 707 cm",
    "The total length of the two coils\nwas, therefore, 707 cm (23 2 feet), with a heating surface of about\n1415 sq cm (1 52 sq ft ) and a total weight of 382 grammes (0 84\npound) The results obtained with this boiler were so far satisfactory as to\nshow that, under the most favorable conditions, when air was\nsupplied in unlimited quantities and there were no disturbing currents\nto put out or interfere with the work [p060] of the burners, steam\n\n\ncould be supplied at a sufficient pressure to run the engines It was\nrealized, however, that the conditions in flight would be very\ndifferent, and that in order to protect the apparatus from the wind,\nsome sort of protecting covering would have to be devised, which\nwould of itself introduce new difficulties in providing the burners\nwith a proper and uniform draft It was\nrealized, however, that the conditions in flight would be very\ndifferent, and that in order to protect the apparatus from the wind,\nsome sort of protecting covering would have to be devised, which\nwould of itself introduce new difficulties in providing the burners\nwith a proper and uniform draft FIG 10 Diagram of pendulum The hull, as at first constructed, consisted of a cylindrical sheathing\nopen in front, through the rear end of which the boiler and aeolipile\nprojected inward, so that the air taken in at the front would be drawn\nthrough the boiler and hearth to the exclusion of lateral currents In\nthe first tests, however, after the hull had been applied, it was\nimpossible to secure a proper rate of combustion, nearly the whole\nhull being filled with a bluish flame, while only a very small portion\nof the gases of combustion passed into the coils of the boiler The\nremedy for this lay in obtaining an increased draft, and a small stack\nwas, therefore, arranged to carry off the products of combustion This\nproved inadequate, and it was only after several weeks of experiment\nwith various types of smoke-stack, and constant alteration of the\naeolipile, that it was possible to make the apparatus work [p061]\nefficiently when it was inside the hull Finally such a degree of success\nwas attained that the burners could be kept lighted even when the\naerodrome was placed in a considerable artificial breeze, created by a\nblower in the shop In connection with these tests of the engines and boilers, some\nmethod was desired, in addition to the Prony brake tests, by which\nthe thrust of the propellers when driven by the engines at various\nspeeds could be measured accurately and in terms which would be\nreadily available in judging whether the aerodromes were ready to be\ngiven an actual trial in free flight Such a method was found in the use\nof an apparatus known as the “pendulum,” which was introduced near\nthe end of 1892, but was not generally used until the end of 1893 After this time, however, this test was made a condition prerequisite\nto taking any of the aerodromes into the field, and proved of the\n\n\ngreatest assistance in estimating the probable outcome of the trials The apparatus used, which is diagrammatically shown in Fig 10,\nwas extremely simple both in theory and operation It consisted\nprimarily of a horizontal arm AC carrying the knife-edge B by which it\nis pivoted on each side on supporting beams not shown Depending\nfrom AC is the light vertical arm DE, rigidly joined to it and carrying\nthe lower horizontal arm FG, all of which are braced together so as to\nmaintain the arm DE constantly perpendicular to AC To this arm FG\nthe model was rigidly attached with its center of gravity in line with\nthe vertical arm DE and its weight increased by the addition of\nproperly disposed flat weights, in order to make the angle of lift for a\ngiven thrust of the propellers smaller and less likely to interfere with\nthe working of the boiler and separator Before the actual test of the “lift” could be made, it was necessary\nto know the exact distance of the vertical center of gravity of the\nmodel and the extra weights from the knife-edge B This was\ndetermined by the following method: A known weight was suspended\nfrom the arm AB at some arbitrarily selected distance from the point\nB This weight caused the perpendicular arms AB and DE to rotate\nthrough an angle, θ, which was measured on the scale KL Knowing,\nthen, the weight on the arm AB, its point of application, the weight of\nthe aerodrome suspended on the arm DE, and the angle of rotation, it\nis easy, by a simple application of trigonometric functions, to\ndetermine the distance of the center of gravity of the model from the\npoint B In a test of Aerodrome No 6 made on September 23, 1898, the\nweight suspended from AB was 10,000 grammes, its point of\napplication 50 cm , the model was weighted to 20,450 grammes, and\nthe angle of rotation, θ, was 7° 2′ Letting y equal the distance of the\nCG from B, we may equate the balanced forces thus:\n10,000×50 cos 7° 2′ = 20,450×y sin 7° 2′\n10,000×50 cot 7° 2′ = 20,450y\ny = 198 2 cm [p062]\nHaving determined this distance, the weight on AB was removed\nand the aerodrome was allowed to regain its former position The\ndistance of the center of thrust from B was then measured The engine\n\n\nwas next started and the number of revolutions of the propellers\ncounted by a tachometer The thrust of the propellers, acting\nperpendicularly to the arm BD, produced rotation around the point B,\nthe angle of which was measured as above In the power test of No 6, the following data were obtained:\nW = weight of aerodrome = 20,450 grammes θ = angle of lift = 19° 30′ Distance of CG from center of rotation = 198 2 cm Distance of center of thrust from center of rotation = 186 3 cm As the propeller thrust and the weight of the model are forces acting\nin opposite directions at known distances from a center of rotation,\nletting L equal the “dead lift,” we may express the equation thus:\nW sin θ × 198 2 = L × 186 3,\nL =\n198 2\n186 3\n × sin 19° 30′ × 20,450,\nL = 7,263 grammes “dead lift ”\nThe flying weight of Aerodrome No 6 was 12,064 grammes, and the\nper cent of this weight lifted was, therefore,\n7,263\n12,064\n = 60 3",
    "3 This was much more than was necessary for flight, but in order to\ninsure successful flights and avoid delay, the rule was made in 1895\nthat no aerodrome was to be launched until it had previously\ndemonstrated its ability to generate enough power to maintain for at\nleast two minutes a lift of 50 per cent of the total flying weight At the\nsame time other important data were obtained, such as the steam-\npressure, the time required to raise sufficient steam, the total time of\nthe run, and the general working of the boilers and engines As will easily be seen, these tests afforded a most satisfactory basis\nof judging what the aerodromes might be expected to do in actual\nflight if the balancing were correct At this time, October, 1893, the aerodrome (Old No 4) was\npractically complete, and the most anxious thought was given to\nlightening it in every way consistent with the ever-present demand for\n\n\nmore power, which necessitated an increase in the weight of both\nburners and boilers to supply the requisite steam On November 14, when the aerodrome was prepared to be shipped\nto Quantico for trial, its condition was about as follows The steam-\ngenerating apparatus—the parts of which were of substantially the\nforms last described, although some slight improvements had been\nintroduced—had been developed to [p063] such a point that a pressure\nof from 70 to 80 pounds of steam could be maintained for 70 seconds,\nwhen it was tested in the shop What it would do under the\nunfavorable conditions imposed by flight was to be learned only by\ntrial At this pressure, the engines, the efficiency of which had been\nincreased \nby \nan \nimprovement \nin \npacking, \nwould \ndevelop\napproximately 0 4 indicated H P , while at 105 pounds pressure they\nat times developed as much as 0 8 H P When the aerodrome was\ntested on the pendulum, these engines, when making less than 700\nrevolutions per minute, lifted over 40 per cent of the total flying\nweight The propellers used at this time were accurate helices, having a\ndiameter of 60 cm , a width of blade of approximately 36 degrees, and\na pitch-ratio of 1 25",

    "ft of supporting surface to the pound of weight, which would have\nbeen barely sufficient to sustain the aerodrome, even if it had been\nsuccessfully launched and the wings had been built much stronger\nthan the flimsy construction in use at this time An air chamber, which served the double purpose of floating the\naerodrome and of providing a moveable weight by which the center\nof gravity could be shifted to the proper position relatively to the\ncenter of pressure, was constructed of the thinnest sheet-iron and\nattached to the midrod This aerodrome, the fifth in actual construction, and the first, after\nyears of experiment, to be carried into the field, was transported to\nQuantico, where the first trial with it was made on November 20,\nunder the conditions described in Chapter IX ◊ 1894\nThe aerodrome, No 4, which has just been described, had not been\n\n\nput to the test of an actual flight, for reasons connected with the\ndifficulties of launching, which are more fully described elsewhere;\nbut, when the completed machine was more fully studied in\nconnection with the unfavorable conditions which it was seen would\nbe imposed on it in trials in the open air, many possibilities for\nimprovement presented themselves It was seen, for instance, that a\nbetter design might be made, in which the engines, boiler and\naeolipile might be placed so that the center of gravity of each would\nlie in the same vertical plane as the central line of the aerodrome In\norder to do this the construction of a single midrod, which was the\ndistinguishing feature of Old No 4, had to be essentially departed\nfrom, the midrod of this new one, No 5, being opened out into two\nrods, so to speak, which were bent out so that the open space between\nthem furnished a sufficiently large hull space to hold the entire power\ngenerating apparatus In arranging the machinery within this hull, it\nwas provided that, as the water and fuel were expended, the center of\ngravity of the aerodrome would shift little, and, if at all, backward\nrelatively to the center of pressure Instead of the two small engines, which it will be remembered were\nmounted on the cross-frame in No 4, a single engine with a larger\ncylinder, having a diameter of 3 3 cm (1 3 in ) and a stroke of 7 cm (2 76 in ), capable of developing about 1 H P was used This engine\nwas mounted within the hull near the forward end and drove the\npropellers by suitable gearing [p065]\nIn addition to these radical changes many important improvements\nwere made in the different parts Internal compartments were built in\nthe separator, so that even if the water was displaced by the pitching\nof the aerodrome, it could still perform its functions properly The\npump was provided with a ratchet, so that it could be worked by hand\nafter the burners were lighted, and before enough steam had been\nraised to enable the engine to run it An active circulation was thus\nmaintained in the coils of the boiler as soon as the burner was lighted\nand before the engine was started, which prevented the tubing from\nbeing burnt out, as had frequently happened previously The wing\nconstruction was also improved and many other changes were\nintroduced, which will be treated separately In the meantime, No 4, which had been damaged in the attempted\n\n\nlaunching in November, 1893, was strengthened and prepared for\nanother trial which took place in January, 1894 By the end of the first week in February, the engine of No 5 was\nready for trial, and with a boiler pressure of about 80 pounds per\nsquare inch, apparently developed 0 56 H P on the Prony brake,\nwhen making 800 revolutions per minute To accomplish this called\nfor such good distribution of steam in the cylinder, that it is doubtful\nif the power could be exceeded at that speed and pressure It was, however, apparent that it was desirable to have a boiler\ncapable of supplying steam for at least one horse-power, and that in\norder to do this, there must be an improvement in the aeolipiles The\nproblem consisted in arranging to evaporate more than 500 cu cm ,\nand in fact as nearly as possible 1000 cu cm (61 cu in ) of water per\nminute, and, since from 200 to 300 cu cm",
    "cm per minute had already\nbeen \nevaporated, \nthis \nwas \nnot \nregarded \nas \nimpossible \nof\naccomplishment The theoretical advantages of gasoline had for a long\ntime been recognized, as well as the very practical advantage\npossessed by it of keeping lighted in a breeze, and several attempts\nhad been made during the latter part of the previous year to construct\na suitable burner for use with it These had not been very successful;\nbut in view of the increasing demand for a flame of greater efficiency\nthan that of the alcohol aeolipiles, it was decided to resume the\nexperiments with it Accordingly, a gasoline evaporator was tried, consisting in the first\nexperiment of a gasoline tank with nine flues, through which steam\nwas passed A flow of steam gave a rapid evaporation of gasoline\nwhen the pressure did not exceed 5 pounds The chief difficulty with\nthe burner employed was that the supply of gasoline gas would rise\nand fall as the steam rose and fell, conditions just the opposite of what\nwas really desired On the other hand, it was thought that this\ngasoline tank would form a real condenser for the steam, so that a\n[p066] portion of the exhaust steam would be condensed and be\navailable for use in the boiler again The gasoline vapor had many\nadvantages over the alcohol; but it was at first possible to evaporate\nonly 120 cu The gasoline vapor had many\nadvantages over the alcohol; but it was at first possible to evaporate\nonly 120 cu cm of gasoline in a minute In the experiments that were made at this time (March 9) with\ngasoline, the main object in view was to obtain a smooth blue flame\n\n\nat 10 pounds pressure There had been failures to accomplish this,\nowing to the high boiling point of the liquid, and while the work was\nin progress it was still evident that the problem of the boiler and the\nflame which was to heat it had not been solved A Prony brake test\ngave, at 130 pounds pressure, 1 1 H P with about 1000 revolutions\nof the propellers; but this was with steam supplied from the boiler of\nthe stationary shop engine On April 1, 1894, the following record was made of the condition of\nAerodrome No",
    "On April 1, 1894, the following record was made of the condition of\nAerodrome No 5:\n“The wings, the tail, and the two 80 cm propellers, as well as the two\nsmaller propellers, are ready The cylinders, gear, pump, and every essential\nof the running gear, are in place The boilers, separators, and adjuncts are\nstill under experiment, but may be hoped to be ready in a few days At\npresent, the boilers give from 450 to 600 grammes of mixed steam and\nwater per minute With 130 pounds of steam, the engine has actually\ndeveloped at the brake, without cut-off, considerably more than 1 H P , so\nthat it may be confidently considered that at 150 pounds, with cut-off, it\nwill give at least 0 8 H P , if it works proportionately well ”\nThe delays incident to the accomplishment of the work in hand\nwere always greater than anticipated, as is instanced by the fact that\nit was the latter part of September before the work was actually\ncompleted The greater part of this delay was due to the necessity for\na constant series of experiments during the spring and summer to\ndetermine the power that it was possible to obtain with the various\nstyles of boilers, aeolipiles, and gasoline burners The greater part of this delay was due to the necessity for\na constant series of experiments during the spring and summer to\ndetermine the power that it was possible to obtain with the various\nstyles of boilers, aeolipiles, and gasoline burners While No",
    "While No 5 was thus under construction, new and somewhat larger\nengines had been built for No 4, the work on them having been\nbegun in January The cylinders of these engines, which are more\nfully described in connection with Aerodrome No 6, were 2 8 cm in\ndiameter, with a 5 cm stroke, each cylinder thus having a capacity of\n30 8 cu cm , which was an increase of 36 per cent over that of the old\nbrass cylinder engines, which had previously been used on No , which was an increase of 36 per cent over that of the old\nbrass cylinder engines, which had previously been used on No 4 On\nApril 28, under a pressure of 70 pounds, these engines drove the two\n60 cm propellers at a rate of 900 R P M , and lifted on the pendulum\nnearly 40 per cent of the total flying weight of Aerodrome No 4,\nwhich was now approximately 5 kilos A trial was made at Quantico\nin the latter part of May, which is described in Chapter IX ◊ It is only\nnecessary to mention in this connection that there was a great deal of\n\n\ntrouble experienced with the alcohol aeolipile, the flame being\nextinguished in the moderate wind to which the [p067] aerodrome was\nsubjected while preparations for the launch were being made Moreover the flame was so nearly invisible in the sunlight that it was\nuncertain whether it was burning in the critical instants just before\nthe launch, when doubt might be fatal These conditions resulted in a\nfinal decision in favor of gasoline, on account of its greater\ninflammability, and in the provision of such hull covering that the\nfires could be lighted and maintained in a breeze In June, I tried a modification of the burner, in which the gasoline\nwas delivered under the pressure of air to the evaporating coil In the\nfirst trial steam was raised to a final pressure of about 70 pounds, and\na run of 45 seconds was secured under a pressure of 40 pounds in the\ngasoline tank, which was thought to be altogether too high; for, at the\nend of the run, the whole apparatus was enveloped in flames, because\nof the gasoline that was projected through the burner-tips Continual experiments with different forms of burner, illustrated in\nPlate 12, occupied the time, with delays and imperfect results, which\nwere trying to the investigator, but are omitted as of little interest to\nthe reader They had, however, the incidental result of proving the\npractical superiority of gasoline over alcohol, and culminated in the\nevolution of the burner that was finally used successfully It consisted\nof a tank for the gasoline, from which compressed air delivered the\nliquid to a small coil surrounded by asbestos, in which it was\nvaporized At the rear end of this coil three pipes were led off, one of\nwhich was a small “bleeder,” which fed the burner for heating the\ngasoline, the other two leading to the main burners After the\ngeneration of gas in the small coil had been started, the heat from the\nsmall burner was expected to continue the vaporization, so that\nnothing but gas would be able to reach the main burners A device\nwas also introduced, which had greatly increased the amount and\nuniformity of the draft and consequently made the burners and boilers\nmore efficient than before This consisted simply in passing the\nexhaust steam from the engines into the smoke-stack, and it is\nremarkable that it was not thought of earlier By the middle of September, 1894, both aerodromes were\ncompleted and ready for another test On September 27 the condition\n\n\nof Aerodrome No 4 was as follows: The general type of construction,\nnamely, that of a single midrod, to which all the steam generating\napparatus was attached, and which supported also the cross-frame\nand the wings, was the same as in the construction of 1893 On\naccount of the increased weight of the model, and the substitution of\nan inferior piece of tubing in place of the former midrod, it was found\nnecessary to stiffen it by the use of temporary trusses Permanent\nbearing points for holding the aerodrome securely to the newly\ndevised launching apparatus were also attached to this midrod [p068]\nThe engines in use at this time were the small steel cylinders\ndescribed above, which were mounted on the cross-frame, and drove\nthe propellers directly These engines were capable of delivering to\nthe propellers, as had been proved by repeated tests, at least 0 66\nbrake horse-power The boiler consisted of two inner coils and an enveloping outer coil,\nloosely wound and connected in series The inner coils, each of which\nhad about 17 turns of 8 mm diameter, 0 2 mm thick tubing,\ndeveloped about 80 per cent of the steam; the outer coil of 8 turns,\nwhile not exactly useless as a steam generator, afforded an efficient\nmeans of fastening the smoke-stack and cover of the boiler, and for\nattaching the latter to the midrod This boiler was externally 30 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 10 cm deep, weighing with its cover\napproximately 650 grammes The stack for the burnt gases, into which\nexhaust steam was led from a central jet, was about 1 foot long At\nbest this boiler was capable of developing slightly over 100 pounds of\nsteam The separator was of the form last described, except that the steam\ndome had been moved toward the front, to prevent the jerk of the\nlaunching car in starting from causing water to be pitched over into\nthe engines It was constructed of sheet aluminum-bronze, and\nweighed, together with its pump, 580 grammes The pump, which was\ndouble-acting and fitted with ball valves, was capable of discharging\n4 5 grammes of cold water per stroke, its efficiency being only about\none-half as great with hot water The gasoline burner, which had been finally adopted in place of the\nalcohol aeolipiles, had now been perfected to the form in which it was\nfinally used Two Bunsen burners of special construction were\n\n\nprovided with gasoline gas by the heat of an intermediate accessory\nburner, which played upon a coil to which all three burners were\nconnected Gasoline was furnished from a tank made of aluminum-\nbronze, under an air pressure of about 20 pounds, the fluid being\nunder the control of a screw stop-cock This tank, which was capable\nof holding 100 to 150 cu cm of gasoline, weighed 180 grammes, and\nthe burners with an outer sheathing weighed 302 grammes It was calculated that about 3300 cu cm (201 cu in ) of air space\nwould be required to float the aerodrome in water, and this was\nsupplied by an air chamber, having a capacity of 2700 cu cm (165\ncu in ), which could be shifted to adjust the longitudinal equilibrium\nof the aerodrome, and about 900 cu cm (55 cu in ) of space in the\ngasoline tank and the midrod The reel and float, which served to\nindicate the location of the aerodrome, if for any reason it should be\nsubmerged, were in one piece, and so moored that there was no\ndanger of fouling the propellers The total weight of the aerodrome was about 6 kilogrammes (13 2\nlbs ), or, with a maximum quantity of fuel (850 cu cm of water, 150\ncu cm of gasoline), [p069] less than 7 kilogrammes From 60 to 90\npounds of steam could be maintained by the boilers for about 2\nminutes, at which pressure the engines developed about 0 66 brake\nhorse-power, driving the 70 cm , 1 25 pitch-ratio propellers at 700 R P M , and giving a lift of from 2 6 to 3 0 kilos (5 7 to 6 6 pounds), or\nabout 40 per cent of the flying weight The wings and tail had a total surface of 2 62 sq m (28 2 sq ft ),\ngiving a ratio of 2 7 kilos to 1 sq m of wing surface (1 8 sq ft per\npound) If the hull resistance be neglected, the soaring speed of this\naerodrome was about 5 9 metres (19 feet) per second, or 13 miles per\nhour",
    "9 metres (19 feet) per second, or 13 miles per\nhour Turning now to the completed No Turning now to the completed No 5, its frame was of the “double\nmidrod” type described above, the two tubes which formed the frame\nbeing prolonged at the front and rear to afford points of attachment\nfor the wings and tail The range through which the wings could be\nshifted to adjust the position of the center of pressure was, however,\nvery small The hull, which, it will be remembered, contained all the\npower generating apparatus, was much stronger and heavier than that\nof No 4, and resembled somewhat the hull of a ship It had a frame-\n\n\nwork of steel tubing brazed to the midrod, to which an outer\nsheathing of sheet aluminum 0 3 mm thick was attached It was,\nhowever, excessively heavy, weighing nearly 800 grammes The engine, which was mounted near the front of the hull, was the\nsingle cylinder, one horse-power engine, described above, which\ndrove the two propellers by suitable gearing The remaining parts of\nthe power plant were identical with those already described in\nconnection with No 4, but the more advantageous location of them in\nNo 5 rendered them somewhat more efficient It had been planned to use 80 cm propellers of 1 25 pitch-ratio on\nNo 5, but it was found in the shop tests of the aerodrome that the\ncross-frame was not strong enough to withstand the strains, and that\nthe engine could be made to work much more steadily with a smaller\npropeller Accordingly, propellers of 70 cm diameter and 1 25 pitch-\nratio, similar to those used on No 4, were finally substituted",
    "4, were finally substituted For floating the aerodrome, when it descended into the water, an\nair-chamber similar to that of No 4, but of a larger capacity was\nprovided With this in place on the aerodrome, it was calculated that,\nif all the parts except this float and the gasoline tank were filled with\nwater, there would still be a buoyancy of over 2 kilogrammes The total weight of No 5 was 8200 grammes, or with its full supply\nof fuel and water 9200 grammes In this aerodrome the same boilers\nused in No 4 were capable of maintaining for at least a minute 115\npounds of steam, so that the engine now gave the maximum of one\nbrake horse-power for which it was designed, and, driving the 70 cm propellers, lifted repeatedly nearly 45 per cent of the flying weight [p070]\nThe wings and tail constructed for No 5 were identical with those\nof No 4, being slightly curved and containing 2 62 sq m (28 2 sq ft ), equivalent to 1 4 sq ft ft to the pound, which with the flimsy\nconstruction of the wings gave an entirely inadequate support to the\naerodrome During the summer a launching apparatus of a new and improved\ntype, which is described in Chapter X ◊, had been perfected, and with\nit repeated tests were made of both aerodromes in October,\nNovember, and December, with the unsatisfactory results recorded in\nChapter IX ◊ In the course of these experiments, many slight\n\n\nmodifications of the burners and boilers were made, but no important\nchanges were introduced except that the cross-frame of No 5 was\nenlarged and strengthened so as to admit of its carrying one metre\npropellers safely The results, however, which were obtained, did not\ncompensate for the increased weight of the larger frame Viewing the work of this year from the standpoint of results\nobtained in the numerous attempts at flight, it would seem that very\nlittle progress had been made, and that there was small reason to\nexpect to achieve final success However, if the work be examined\nmore particularly, it will be seen that two of the most difficult\nproblems had been solved, one completely as far as the models were\nconcerned, and the other to a very satisfactory degree First, a\nlaunching apparatus, with which it was possible to give the\naerodrome any desired initial velocity, had been devised, and so far\nperfected that no trouble was ever experienced with it in testing the\nmodels Second, as a result of the extended and systematic series of\nexperiments, which had been conducted under the direction of Dr Barus, a steam pressure of 115 pounds could be maintained steadily in\nthe boilers for at least a minute, and the burners could be kept lighted\neven in a considerable breeze A summary of these experiments, together with some account of the\ndifficulties encountered and the results finally obtained with the\napparatus in use at the end of the year, is given in the following\nreport, which was prepared by Dr Barus in December, 1894",
    "Barus in December, 1894 “If water be sprayed upon a surface kept in a permanent state of ignition,\nany quantity of steam might be generated per time unit Similarly\nadvantageous conditions would be given if threads of water could be passed\nthrough a flame In practice this method would encounter two serious\ndifficulties, the importance of which is accentuated when the boiler\napparatus is to be kept within the degree of lightness essential in\naerodromics These difficulties are (1) the danger of chilling the flame\nbelow the point of ignition or of combustion of the gases, and (2) the\npractical impossibility of maintaining threads of water in the flame For it is\nclear that the threads must be joined in multiple arc, so as to allow a large\nbulk of water to circulate through the boiler, whereas even when there are\nbut two independent passages for the water through the furnace, it is hard\nto keep both supplied with liquid without unduly straining the pump If the\nwater be even slightly deficient, circumstances will arise in which one of\n[p071] the passages is better than the other This conduit will then generate\nmore steam and drive the water under force through the other passage,\nincreasing the temperature discrepancy between them Eventually the hot\n\n\npassage reaches ignition and either bursts or melts This is what sooner or\nlater takes place in boilers adapted for flying machines and consisting of\ntubes joined in multiple arc, when a single moderately strong circulating\npump supplies the system",
    "This is what sooner or\nlater takes place in boilers adapted for flying machines and consisting of\ntubes joined in multiple arc, when a single moderately strong circulating\npump supplies the system “To avoid these annoyances, i e , to increase the length of life of the\nboiler, the boiler tubes are joined in series to the effect that a single current\nof water may flow successively through all of them It is needful therefore\nto select wide tubes, such as will admit of an easy circulation in\nconsideration of the length of tubing employed without straining the pump\nand at the same time to allow sufficient room for the efflux of steam Other\nconsiderations enter here, the bearing of which will be seen presently: if the\ntube be too wide the difficulty of coiling it on a mandrel of small diameter\nis increased, while at the same time the tube loses strength (cæt Other\nconsiderations enter here, the bearing of which will be seen presently: if the\ntube be too wide the difficulty of coiling it on a mandrel of small diameter\nis increased, while at the same time the tube loses strength (cæt par ) in\nvirtue of the increased width Diagram 1 Diagram 2 FIG 11 “It is from considerations such as these that, in the course of many\nexperiments, copper tubing about 8 mm in diameter has been adopted Copper is selected because of its freedom from internal corrosion, easy\ncoiling, and because of its availability in the market The thinnest tube to\nbe had (walls only 0 1 mm thick) will withstand more pressure than can be\nentrusted to the larger steam receivers in circuit with the boiler The boiler\nweight is thus a negligible factor, and it is quite feasible to reduce the\nthickness of boiler tubing, by the superficial application of moderately\nstrong nitric acid, to 200–400 grammes per horse-power of steam supplied External corrosion due to flames occurs only in case of deficient water, and\nif the boiler be made of tubing with the walls 0",
    "External corrosion due to flames occurs only in case of deficient water, and\nif the boiler be made of tubing with the walls 0 2 mm thick, it is in view of\nthe possibility of such accidents Boilers may then be tested to 25 atm without endangering the metal “Boilers are wound or coiled with regard to the two points above\nsuggested, viz : to avoid chilling the flame the successive turns are spaced\non all sides, and to bring the water as nearly into the flame as possible, the\ndiameter of the coils is chosen as small as expedient Further reasons for\nthis will presently be adduced The type of boiler eventually adopted is\nshown in the accompanying diagrams, 1 and 2, Fig The type of boiler eventually adopted is\nshown in the accompanying diagrams, 1 and 2, Fig 11 “Diagram 1, is a perspective diagram showing the plan of winding and\nDiagram 2, an end view The circulation is indicated There are two inner\ncoils [p072] each containing about 17 turns, wound on a mandrel 5 cm in\ndiameter The turns are spaced so as to allow about 1 cm clear between\nsuccessive turns clear between\nsuccessive turns The outer coil envelopes both, and in this there are about\n3 cm between successive turns, and 8 turns in all Length, say, 30 cm ,\nbreadth 16 cm , thickness 10 cm , give the external dimensions of the\nboiler The shell space between outer and inner layers of tubing must\nnowhere be less than 1 cm When so wound, the inner coils (here as in\n\n\nother boiler forms) raise about 80 per cent or more of the steam; the outer\nor enveloping coil, while not quite useless, make the most effective frame\nwork for the boiler jacket which has been devised The coils are brazed\ntogether by blind tubes, as shown in Diagram 2, to keep the whole in shape Weight with couplings and cover when complete 535 grammes “The cover is preferably of mica, through which the flame within the\nboiler may be seen, and in which lightness, nonconduction, and resistance\nto the disintegrating effects of high temperature are met with in a\npronounced degree This jacket is held down by copper bands and the end\nband is continuous with the long smoke-stack, as will be presently shown “The wide form of boiler with two coils within the envelope is not\nabsolutely essential The same amount of steam can be generated from one\ncoil in an envelope in other respects equal to Diagram 1 if a sufficiently hot\nflame be passed axially through the coils Such a flame, however, is\nunstable, and for this reason two milder flames with a good air access are to\nbe preferred on practical grounds even if the weight is thereby increased “To further understand the boiler construction it is advisable to consider\nthe action of the flame Inasmuch as wide tubes must be used, the problem\nof evaporating water as fast as possible is equivalent to getting heat into the\ncurrent (water and steam circulating through the coils) as fast as possible\nfrom without If, therefore, t is the mean temperature of the fluids within\nthe coils, and T the effective temperature surrounding the tube, then the\nrate at which heat will flow into the tubes is proportional to T−t Now t the\ntemperature of the steam is nearly constant (100°–150°) whereas T the\neffective flame temperature may vary from 800° to, say, 1600° It is for this\nreason that the heat sponged up by the boiler depends almost directly on\nthe flame temperature “What conditions, therefore, will make the flame effectively hot “(1) The coils must obviously be brought as nearly into the flame as\nfeasible: for this purpose the cylindrical helix is better than any other form But\n“(2) The turns and coils must not be so crowded together as to chill the\nflame into imperfect combustion in various parts of its extent Hence the\nloose form of winding Again\n“(3) There must be oxygen enough to allow complete combustion, and\n“(4) The flame itself must be hot and the radiation checked by good\njacketing “To take up the last points: the effective heat of the flame depends not\nonly on the combustion heat of the fuel used; it depends also, among other\nthings, on the speed with which this combustion takes place A flame\nburning from a low pressure of alcohol gas will be at low temperature as\ncompared with a flame burning from high pressures of the gas If the flame\nbe burnt from a Bunsen burner in the usual way it is an interesting question\nto know how flame temperature will vary with gas pressure At present we\nknow it merely in steam pressures incidently produced in a given engine\n(No 4) as for instance:\nFlame pressure, 10 lbs , 20 lbs , 30 lbs Steam pressure, 40 lbs , 80 lbs , 120 lbs in the running engine [p073]\n“Unfortunately there is a limit set to this process of increasing the steam\nsupply, quite aside from conditions inherent in the method This is due to\nthe fact that a certain speed of efflux cannot be exceeded without putting\nthe flame out",
    "This is due to\nthe fact that a certain speed of efflux cannot be exceeded without putting\nthe flame out Suppose, for instance, in Fig 12, that a gas generated from a\nliquid is ignited at the end of the Bunsen burner F; then if the velocity of\nefflux of mixed gas and air in the direction AB from the mouth of F exceeds\nthe velocity of combustion in the direction BA, the flame will obviously be\ncarried away from the mouth of the tube and dissipated This state of things\nis actually realized at pressures exceeding about 15 lbs , depending on the\ndegree of mixture of the combustible gases used, and therefore on\napparently haphazard conditions connected with the jet, the air holes, the\nair supply, etc , depending on the\ndegree of mixture of the combustible gases used, and therefore on\napparently haphazard conditions connected with the jet, the air holes, the\nair supply, etc FIG 12 FIG 13 13 “If, however, the velocity of the jet at the point of efflux be checked by\nan obstruction like a cylinder C, Fig 13, placed co-axially with the burner\ntube F, the speed of combustion will no longer be exceeded (supposing C\nproperly chosen) and flames will then burn from high-pressure gas In this\nway flames were maintained generated from alcohol gas at even 40 lbs and\nabove FIG 14 “The gas escaping from the Bunsen burner is never sufficiently aërated to\nburn completely Otherwise there would (in general) be explosions in the\ntube F A part of this air is supplied at the mouth of the boiler B, Fig 14,\nand the amount available here will depend on the velocity of the jet F Hence it does not follow that a high-pressure burner like that in Fig 11 will\nsupply a proportionate amount of heat, since its jet suction is not intense\nand the combustion within the boiler is incomplete This difficulty may be\nremedied by placing [p074] air holes in the jacket of the boiler, provided the\nboiler be wrapped loosely enough not to chill the flame below ignition It is\nwith reference to this effect that the boilers, Fig 11, were wound A\nnumber of rifts aaa, Fig 15, are then left in the jacket through which air\nmay enter in virtue of the burner flame acting as a jet at the mouth of the\nboiler “When so constructed the flame at first enters the inner coil only; but\nafter a little while it suddenly spreads out throughout the whole interior\nspace and envelops the coils This sudden expansion is due, probably, to the\n\n\nassumption of the spheroidal state by the water within the coils, the current\nnow flaring on an enveloping cushion of steam The pump must work well,\nfor deficient water means a hot tube and deficient steam, or eventually a\nrupture of the tube “Thus far the dependence for draft has been on the burner jet and the\nsuction of the smoke-stack in virtue of the inertia of the moving gases But\neven with this ventilated boiler, this method is limited to certain\ndimensions of the boiler Thus a boiler 80 cm long yielded about the same\nquantity of steam as a boiler half as long and otherwise similar Only the\ninitial parts of the boiler are, therefore, relatively efficient, and the reason\nof this seems to be that, apart from shape, etc , the flame as a heat-\nproducing agent is practically defunct, when a certain amount of heat has\nbeen taken out of it: in other words, even with fair ventilation the flame is\neventually chilled off by the voluminous products of combustion\ncontinually accumulating in the boiler The same choking action\naccompanies the presence of unburnt gases If, for instance, the flame be\nburnt in the air, it is slender and much smaller in volume than in the boiler The flame is also of small volume and burns completely in a wide boiler,\nbut the steam is always deficient, because of the distance between flame\nand coils (see above) With the above apparatus about\n1\n2\nlb of dry steam per minute per square foot of heating surface was attained",
    "of dry steam per minute per square foot of heating surface was attained FIG 15 “This introduces the final condition for rapid steam generation There\nmust be artificial suction at the smoke-stack By passing the exhaust steam\nin the form of a central jet through the smoke-stack the yield of steam was\nincreased 20 to 30 per cent In fact as the supply of gas from the burner is\ngiven, the artificial suction in question means more air in the boiler for the\nsame amount of gas and it means also a more rapid removal of the exhaust\ngases The experiments with steam suction are yet to be completed, and\nwith them the boiler question is to be finally laid at rest The chief points at\nissue are these:\n“1 The chief points at\nissue are these:\n“1 Seeing that the jet suction increases with the length of the smoke-\nstack, up to a certain length at least, how long and how wide must the\nefficient smoke-stack be made Thus a smoke-stack 10 cm long is all but\nuseless Good results are obtained when the stack measures 30 cm in\nlength beyond the end of the steam jet [p075]\n“2 What is the relative efficiency of the initial and final halves of the\nlength of the boiler This will show in how far it is useful to increase the\nlength of the boiler for a given burner and steam jet It will also show what\nadvantage is to be gained from triplicate boilers with three burners, as\ncompared with duplicate boilers with two burners, or single boilers with\none burner, when the same weight of tubing is used throughout “3 What is the effect of pressure on the aeolipile tank, or in how far does\nthe steam generated depend on what may be called the pressure of the\n\n\nflame This is also an important point which remains for quantitative\nsolution It can be approached in two ways: either by finding the steam\nevaporated in terms of the tank pressure, or by finding the temperature of\nthe flame pyrometrically",
    "It can be approached in two ways: either by finding the steam\nevaporated in terms of the tank pressure, or by finding the temperature of\nthe flame pyrometrically “4 “4 What speed of water circulation best conduces to steam generation A\ngood pump is now installed by which the circulation can be varied If water\ncan be put into the boiler just fast enough to come out dry steam at the\nother end, the efficiency ought to be a maximum, but it does not follow that\nit will be so, for one can imagine a wet circulation sponging up more heat\nthan one which is just dry at the end ”\n1895\nDuring January and February, 1895, the experiments with boilers\nand burners were continued and even better and more uniform results\nthan those given above were obtained The boilers of Aerodrome No 5 were finally brought to such a state of efficiency, that under\nfavorable conditions a lift of nearly sixty per cent of the flying weight\nwas secured This was much more than was required for flight, but it\nwas decided to postpone the trials until No 4 could also be made\nready for a test and the frame of No 5 could itself be strengthened in\nmany weak places Upon examining No 4, which had been put aside since the trials in\nDecember, it was found to have rusted so badly throughout and to be\nso unfit in every way for trial, that a complete reconstruction of the\nwhole would be necessary So many advantages had been gained in\nNo 5 by the double midrod type of construction that it was decided to\nrebuild No 4 on a modification of the same plan, as shown in Plate\n11, retaining, however, the same engines which had been used before In this a very guarded return was made to the type which had\nproved so unsatisfactory in No 0, that is, making the hull support\nrods at the front and rear for attaching the wings and tail In this case,\nhowever, the hull was constructed very rigidly, and the tubes at the\nfront and rear were firmly attached and braced so that they could\nwithstand a considerable strain without undue distortion The work\non this frame was completed in March, but the other parts were not in\nentirely efficient condition even in May, when the aerodromes were\ntaken to Quantico for trial Moreover, it was found that the weight of\nthis aerodrome had increased far beyond the original estimates [p076]\nIn view of the disasters from trials in the field, due to inability to\nobtain automatic equilibrium in flight and to the flexure of the large\n\n\nwings rather than to defects of the engines, the conditions at this time,\nafter three years of failure, seemed so nearly hopeless, that without\nabandoning the work on these steam aerodromes, I again had\nrecourse to the early plan of constructing smaller models driven by\nIndia rubber, in which the small wings employed could be made of\nthe requisite stiffness Instead of employing twisted rubber, however,\nthe defects of which had been amply proved in previous trials, these\nnew constructions were meant to employ rubber directly stretched\nand pulling In this condition the rubber exercises nearly six times the\npower in proportion to weight that it does when twisted, but on the\nother hand it requires a very strong frame and subordinate parts I spent an inordinate amount of time and labor during this year in\nattempting to employ this latter form of construction and finally got a\nfew useful results from it, but none in proportion to the labor\nexpended During March, Aerodrome No 5, the frame of which had proved on\ntest to be radically weak, was completely refinished except for the\nwings The propellers had hitherto been made of wood, but in May, I\ncommenced a new construction of steel, wood and cloth, on a plan\ngiving a figure which, though not rigorously helicoidal, was\npractically near enough to the theoretical form and was also both\nlighter and more elastic than the wooden construction On May 8 and June 7 Aerodrome No 5 was again tried at Quantico,\nand although the tests were unsuccessful, in that the aerodrome failed\nto fly, partly because of the fact that so much time was spent in\nraising steam that practically the entire supply of fuel and water was\nexhausted before the aerodrome was actually launched, yet it had\ncome so much nearer flying than any machine had previously done,\nthat it was felt that if either the power could be increased or the\nweight decreased even a slight amount, the aerodrome would\nprobably fly In view of the great care that had been exercised in\nkeeping down the weight, it seemed almost hopeless to attempt to\nreduce it, and it also seemed equally hopeless to attempt to get more\npower without increasing the weight However, something had to be\ndone to increase the ratio of power to weight, and as it was seen that\nthis would involve extensive changes in No 5, it was decided to\nentirely rebuild No 4 with this idea in view, though it was evident\n\n\nthat it involved a plan of construction even lighter than the\ndangerously light plan on which No 4 had already been constructed During Mr Langley’s absence in Europe in the summer, Aerodrome\nNo 4 was entirely reconstructed and made to embody many new\ncharacteristics, the changes introduced being so radical that this\nmodel was henceforth designated as “New No 4 ” The new\ncharacteristics of this model were its unprecedentedly [p077] light\nframe and the elevation of the transverse frame 12 centimeters above\nthe midrod, whereby the position of the line of thrust was raised so\nthat it was 20 centimetres from the center of pressure, which from\ntheory seemed to be very nearly its correct position The total flying\nweight was but 6400 grammes (14 pounds), with a total supporting\nsurface of fifty-four square feet, equivalent to very nearly four square\nfeet per pound It was hoped that with this extremely light\nconstruction the “dead lift” would amount to a large percentage of the\nflying weight, and as much as sixty per cent was actually lifted on the\npendulum As, however, the aerodrome approached completion it\nbecame more and more evident that the construction was hopelessly\nfragile, the frame being scarcely able to support itself in the shop By\nNovember this conclusion became certain, and this aerodrome (New\nNo 4) was never put to an actual test in the field The very expensive\nset of wings covered with gold beater’s skin, which were also\nconstructed at this time for this model, proved so weak under test that\nthey were entirely abandoned",
    "The very expensive\nset of wings covered with gold beater’s skin, which were also\nconstructed at this time for this model, proved so weak under test that\nthey were entirely abandoned When Mr When Mr Langley returned to Washington in the fall, many\nimportant points, which had been under special consideration during\nthe past year, particularly those relating to the disposition of\nsustaining surfaces, and the provision of automatic equilibrium, were\nstill not definitely determined It was not yet decided whether two\nsets of wings of equal area should be used for the aerodrome, or what\nthe efficiency per unit of area of the following surfaces was in\ncomparison with the leading surfaces To aid in determining these and\nother important points concerning the relative position of the center\nof gravity and the center of pressure in the horizontal planes, he had\nseveral small gliding models made, which could be used with either\none or two pairs of wings, and afforded an opportunity for testing and\ncomparing several types of curved surfaces These models were built so that the center of gravity could be\nadjusted to any desired point, and had in addition, as a means of\nassisting in preserving equilibrium, a small tail-rudder, shaped\nsomewhat like a child’s dart, which was intended to support no part\nof the weight The tests with these models were very satisfactory and aided greatly\nin the final development of what is known as the “Langley type ”\nIndeed, in the single month of November all the points, which had\nhitherto been more or less indefinite, were finally decided upon, and\nthe tests of the following spring proved these decisions correct Two sets of wings of equal area were hereafter provided for every\naerodrome, which not only greatly increased the stability, but also\novercame the difficulty hitherto experienced in bringing the CP over\nthe CG The tail-rudder, formed of planes intersecting at right angles,\nwas adopted as the means of control In use on the aerodromes it was\nset at a negative angle, and given a certain [p078] degree of elasticity,\nwhich was at first provided in the frame of the rudder, but was later\ngiven by a flat wooden spring, by which it was attached to the\naerodrome The tail in this form now became the sole means of\ncontrolling the equilibrium, and the results obtained with it were so\nvery satisfactory that no further attention was given either to the\ngyroscopic control built during the previous summer, or to any of the\nelectrical forms of control constructed prior to that time, all of which\ninvolved more or less delicate apparatus The definite form into which these ideas crystallized is perhaps best\nexemplified in the letter of instructions issued by Mr Langley on\nNovember 30, 1895 to the men employed on the work The text of\nthis letter is given in the Appendix, and the forms referred to in it for\nrecording the weights and adjustments of the aerodromes are those\nused in the data sheets after this time In October work was resumed on Aerodrome No 5, on which\nnothing had been done since its test on June 7 The reconstruction of\n“Old No 4” into “New No 4” which had occupied the entire summer,\nand the final result of which was the production of a machine so\nradically weak as to be useless, had been so discouraging that it\nseemed vain to attempt in any way to decrease the weight of No 5",
    "5 The addition of the rear wings in place of the tail had, however, so\n\n\ngreatly increased the supporting surface that it seemed possible that\nNo 5 might now be able to fly with no greater engine power than it\nhad on June 7 Some weak places in its frame were, therefore,\nstrengthened and the midrod at the front was raised five centimetres\nin order to raise the center of pressure farther above the center of\ngravity and give the front wings a greater range of adjustment Some\nslight changes were also made in the gearing which drove the pump,\nso as to make it work faster, and new burners, boilers and a gasoline\ntank were constructed during November Later the midrod, which had\nformerly consisted of two separate pieces attached at the front and\nrear respectively of the main frame, was made continuous, and in\norder to avoid passing it through the smoke-stack, the stack was made\nto fork at this point These changes are clearly shown in Plates 14 and\n15, which are photographs taken on December 3 This plan was,\nhowever, soon changed so that the midrod passed through the smoke-\nstack and was rigidly attached to the frame at several points, and a\nnew pump and new boilers were substituted for those which had been\nworn out Aside from these changes, which although small, added\nvery materially to the general strength of the frame, no important\nchanges were made in No 5 prior to its remarkable flight of May 6,\n1896 PL 14 AERODROME NO 5,\nDECEMBER 3, 1895",

    "16 EARLY TYPES OF WINGS AND SYSTEMS OF GUYING ◊\nIt is to be remembered that, while the center of gravity of the\naerodrome could be determined readily and exactly, the center of\npressure could be determined only approximately in advance of trial\nin actual flight The positions [p081] of the supporting surfaces given\nin this chapter are, then, approximations made from rules for\n“balancing,” i e , for obtaining equilibrium in actual flight, rules\nwhich are in fact tentative, since they are founded on a priori\nconsiderations with partial correction from the empirical knowledge\ngained by previous field trials For these rules see Chapter VI ◊ 1893\nWith reference to the supporting and guiding surfaces of\nAerodromes Nos 4, 5, and 6, Aerodrome No 4, in its earliest\ncondition mentioned in the preceding chapter, was taken into the\nfield, but never brought to trial in the air It is sufficient to say that in\nthe largest of the three sets of wings constructed, each wing was 17 ×\n51 inches, and therefore contained about six square feet, so that with\nthe tail (which was at this time a supporting surface), whose area was\none-half that of the two wings, the total supporting surface was 18\nsquare feet, or since the flying weight was 9 1 pounds, the proportion\nof surface to weight was somewhat less than 2 square feet to the\npound The wings were at this time ribless, it being expected that the\nsilk cover which was purposely left loose would take its curve from\nthe air filling it, which subsequent experience has shown would have\nled to certain disaster if the aerodrome had been launched It may be\nadded that there was a vertical rudder of what is now seen to have\nbeen a wholly inadequate size These remarks may be applied with\nlittle modification to the attempted flight with No 4 on May 25,\nexcept that the vertical rudder had been made larger, but was still\nmuch too small 1894\nFrom the account of the field trials to be given in Chapter IX ◊, it\n\n\nwill be seen that in numerous attempts at flight prior to October 6,\n1894, the cause of failure can in every instance be traced to\nimperfections more fundamental than those of the sustaining surfaces,\neither the launching device or some other part failing to work\nsatisfactorily I therefore commence a description of the sustaining\nsurfaces with those of Nos",
    "I therefore commence a description of the sustaining\nsurfaces with those of Nos 4 and 5 as used on that day The construction of the wings of No 4 and No 5, which were\nnearly identical, is shown in Fig A Plate 16 A rod of hickory,\ntapering from\n1\n2\ninch in diameter at the larger end to\n1\n4\ninch at the smaller, was steamed and bent, as shown in the drawing,\nto form the main front rib of the wing This was firmly clamped to the\nmidrod, and to the rib in turn were attached a number of cross-ribs of\nhickory, slightly curved, the inner one of which was fastened to the\nhull at its inner extremity, while the whole was covered with silk The\nlength of each wing was 162 cm (63 75 inches), and the width 54 cm (21 25 inches) The tail was plane and equal in area to one of the\nwings, so that the joint area of the wings and tail was 2 62 square\nmetres (28 2 sq ft ) [p082]\nEach wing was attached to the midrod by a single clamp, different\nforms of which are shown at F, G, H, I (Fig 16) 16) The clamp consisted\nof two short split tubes, into which the main front ribs were securely\nclamped by means of screws They were set at an angle and united to\na grooved frame, by which the wings could be readily attached to a\nsecond piece clamped about the midrod The tail clamp, like the wing\nclamp, was composed of two pieces, sliding one upon the other, but as\nthe tail formed a single surface, one part was permanently attached to\nit Clamps F, G were fitted to aerodrome No 4, and H, I to No 5",
    "5 The\nwings were set at a diedral angle of about 150°, but as they were not\nguyed in any way, this angle in flight and under the upward pressure\nof the air probably became much less The tail was plane but ribbed\nlike the wings FIG 16 Wing clamps, 1892–1896 In preparing the machine for flight, the wings and tail of No 4 were\nset at a very small root angle with the midrod, perhaps not exceeding\n3°, but while this angle might be maintained at the firmly held root of\nthe wing, it was later seen to be probable that the extremity of the\nwing was flexed by the upward pressure of the air after launching,\nthough the full extent and evil effect of this flexure was not\nrecognized at the time In the approximative calculations for\n“balance,” made at this time, the tail was treated as bearing\n1\n3\nof the weight of the aerodrome, as it was\n1\n3\nof the supporting area, for though it was recognized that its position\nin the “lee” of the wings rendered it less efficient, the degree of this\ndiminution of efficiency was not realized A vertical rudder 20 cm ×\n70 cm (8 in × 28 in ), with an area of 0 14 metres (1 5 sq ft ) was\nused [p083]\nThe particulars of the launch will be found in Chapter IX ◊ In the\npresent connection, it is sufficient to say that though launched with\nthe requisite velocity and without accident, it fell into the water at a\ndistance of about 15 metres (49 feet) with the midrod nearly\nhorizontal, the combined effect of engines and initial impulse having\nin fact kept it in the air for less than two seconds The true cause of\nthis failure not then being recognized, it was attributed to the angle of\nthe wings with the midrod having been too small The launch of No 5 followed almost immediately, but taking\nwarning by the supposed cause of failure of No 4, its wings were set\nat a root angle of 20°, and a hurried adjustment was made to secure\ngreater rigidity, the tip being partly secured against twisting by a light\ncross-piece, and guyed so that the wing as a whole was not only at a\ngreater angle, but stiffer than in the case of No 4",
    "4 These changes it\nwas hoped would cause the aerodrome to advance at a considerable\ninitial angle with the horizontal, and it did so, for instantly after the\nlaunch, as the aerodrome escaped from its bonds into free air, the\ninclination of the midrod increased until it stood at about 60°, when\nthe machine, after struggling a moment to maintain itself, slid\nbackward into the water (with its engines working at full speed) after\nadvancing about 12 metres (39 feet), and remaining in the air about 3\n\n\nseconds On the whole, the result of the first actual trial of an aerodrome in\nthe field was disconcerting, for unless the result was due to the wings\nbeing placed in a position wholly unfavorable to support, there\nseemed to be no doubt that either the engine power or the supporting\nsurface was insufficient Now this engine power was by computation\nbetween three and four times what was necessary to support the\naerodrome in horizontal flight at an angle of 20°, and after making\nevery allowance for slip, there should have been still an excess of\npower for the first flight of No 4, whereas actual trial indicated that it\nwas insufficient But on the other hand, the experiment with No 5,\nwhich momentarily held its position in the air at an angle of 60°,\nseemed to indicate that the engine power was abundant, and that the\nfailure must be traced to some other cause As a result of these experiments it was concluded, “that it is an all-\nimportant thing that the angle of the front wing shall be correct, and\nthat this cannot be calculated unless it is known how much the tip\nwill turn up under pressure of the weight ” I felt, then, that I had\nlearned something from the failures as to the need of greater rigidity\nof the wings, though how to obtain this without adding to their\nweight was a trying problem It was thus at an early stage suspected\nthat the evil to be guarded against in wing construction was the\ndistortion of the form of the wing under pressure, chiefly by torsion,\nwhich is specially hard to provide against without a construction\nwhich is [p084] necessarily heavy This suspicion was a correct one,\nthough the full extent of the evil was not yet surmised In the light of subsequent experiment it may now be confidently\nstated that the trouble was with the wings, which at the moment after\nlaunching were flexed wholly out of the shape which they were\ndesigned to have, and which they retained up to that critical moment After returning to Washington, one of the wings was inverted, and a\nquantity of sand, equal in weight to the pressure upon the wing in\nflight, was added, under which the yielding at the tip amounted to\n65°, or from +20° to −45°, showing that the wings were entirely too\nweak to sustain the aerodrome In speaking of the efforts to strengthen the wings, it must be\nconstantly remembered that this could hardly be done in any way\n\n\nwhich did not involve increased weight; that is, it could hardly be\ndone at all, since increased weight was forbidden The first attempt at systematic guying was made on October 27 As\nshown in Fig B, Plate 16, two guy-posts extending beneath the\nmidrod were connected by guy-wires with the outer extremities of the\nwing, by means of which it was sought to hold the wing in place and\nprevent its extremity from twisting upward, while a third wire\nconnecting with the bowsprit prevented its moving backward In\naddition, two aluminum wires, stretched across above from wing to\nwing, kept the lower guys tight On October 27, Aerodrome No 5, equipped with large new wings\nand tail, having a combined area of 3 7 square metres (40 sq ft ), the\nwings being each 64 cm × 192 cm (25 25 in × 75 75 in ), turned\nsharply and completely round, apparently through some internal\ncurrent of the main wind against which it was advancing Owing to\nthis almost instantaneous turn, it lost headway and came down This\nled to the subsequent construction and use of a much larger vertical\nrudder, intended to prevent in future any such sudden pivoting and\nconsequent loss of momentum The wings showed a tendency to\n“pocket”28 and bag, which indicated some serious fault in their\nconstruction As a result of these experiments, it was decided on October 29 to\nattempt to make the wings stiffer (though their weight was almost\nprohibitory), by inserting more cross-pieces, cross-pinning and guying\nthem so as to make them more rigid as a whole, and less liable to\npocket At this time an automatic device in the form of a sliding tail was\ndesigned, which it was thought would cause the center of pressure to\nmove backward when the aerodrome reared, and forward when it\nplunged downward, but the device, though afterward constructed,\nwas never brought to trial in the field Aerodrome No 5, equipped with a new set of wings similar to those\nused [p085] on October 27, and guyed as in the previous experiment,\nwas again launched on November 21, with the results recorded in\nChapter IX ◊ The failure was attributed to the twisting of the wings\nunder pressure to such an extent that not only was their effective area\ngreatly reduced, but the outer portions were upturned so as to catch\n\n\nthe air upon the upper surfaces, the result being in part a downward\npressure On the following day a pair of the wings was inverted and a weight\nof sand equal to the air pressure to which they were subjected in\nflight, was distributed over their surfaces Under the action of this, the\ntwisting of the wing was seen to increase from the root, which was\nheld with comparative rigidity, up to the tip, where in spite of the\ncross-ribs it amounted to 45° The resistance to torsion lay chiefly in\nthe front rib, which, in addition, could be bent easily, allowing the\nsurface to become distorted with great loss of lifting power The experiments of 1894 had demonstrated the urgent necessity for\ngreater rigidity in the sustaining surfaces, which might, as it seemed,\nbe obtained either by increasing the strength of the framing (which\nmeant additional weight) or by resorting to some new and untried\nconstruction, or by a proper system of guying Guying seemingly\noffered the most feasible solution of the problem; but although the\nsystem of wire guying was thoroughly tried, the result was very\nunsatisfactory, as the wings continued to twist and bag in a way that\nwas extremely discouraging 1895\nI accordingly had recourse in 1895 to the system of wooden guy-\nsticks shown in Fig D, Plate 16, which necessarily added greatly to\nthe weight of the sustaining surfaces Each wing was separately\nstrengthened by means of a light rod of spruce, in cross-section about\nthe size of the main front rib, extending across the upper surface of\nthe wing, at a distance of about one-third the width of the wing\nbehind the front rib It was tied to each of the cross-ribs and to the\nouter bent portion of the front rib, and at its root was fastened to the\nframe of the aerodrome This effectually prevented the bending of the front rib and the\nconsequent bagging of the cover, and to that extent marked a decided\nadvance in wing construction But it was faulty, in that, not being\nsupplemented by wire guying, it offered little resistance to the\ntwisting of the wing about the main front rib, the rear tip of the wing\nbeing free to turn up under pressure, as it had done on former\noccasions A similar guy-stick was stretched across the tail To guard\n\n\nagainst torsion, rods extending diagonally across the wings and tail\nwere used, which, with the aid of the guy-sticks just described,\nprevented the surfaces from twisting greatly In addition, a rod joining\nthe front ribs and stretching across from wing to wing tended to\nmaintain a fixed diedral angle [p086]\nThe wings as thus guyed were rigid enough, and in the field-trials of\nNo 5 on May 8 and June 6, did not yield noticeably under pressure,\nand there seemed to be no serious default in their lifting power, but\nthe guy-sticks were heavy and the system was not again employed The wings used in these trials, shown in Fig C, Plate 16, had a frame\nof hickory, consisting of a front rib and nine cross-ribs, over which the\nsilk was tightly stretched The curvature of the wings, which is shown\nin the cross-sectional drawing, had a rise of about one-twelfth the\nwidth, the highest point of curvature occurring about one-fourth the\ndistance from front to rear Each wing was 64 cm × 192 cm (25 25\nin × 75 75 in ), the two with the tail, in surface equal to a single\nwing, having an area of 3 7 square metres (40 sq ft ) The combined\nweight of the wings was 1150 grammes (2 53 pounds), and of the tail,\n583 grammes (1 28 pounds) The evolution of a vertical rudder had meanwhile been going\nsteadily forward Those first used had been small, rectangular, stiff,\nand heavy, but in the experiments of May 8 a much lighter and larger\nconstruction, consisting of a frame 92 cm × 76 cm (36 in × 30 in )\ncovered with paper, was used, and on June 7 this was replaced by a\nlong, diamond-shaped rudder, having a spruce frame covered with\nsilk, very light and seemingly more effective than any hitherto used I had in the meantime designed a “tail-rudder,” consisting of a\nhorizontal tail and vertical rudder combined, each having an area of\nabout 0 6 square metres (6 5 sq ft",
    "ft ) which, however, was not used\nuntil 1896 In August was begun the construction of a deeply curved and\narched pair of wings for No 4, which consisted of a light framing of\nspruce elaborately guyed and covered with gold-beater’s skin drawn\ntight as a drum-head with pyroxelene varnish In their construction a\nnew feature, foreshadowed in the method of guying the separate\nwings used in the field-trials of May and June, was introduced, which\nwas \nadopted \nin \nall \nsubsequent \nconstructions—the \nguy-stick,\n\n\npreviously described as stretching lengthwise across the wing being\nnow made a part of the wing itself, which was thus provided with two\nlongitudinal ribs instead of one The additional rib occupied a central\nposition, and like the front rib was attached to the midrod by means\nof a strong wing clamp Its outer end was united to the front rib,\nwhich was here bent into a quadrant of a circle This pair of wings\nhad an expanse of 435 cm This pair of wings\nhad an expanse of 435 cm (14 3 feet), an area of 2 5 square metres\n(26 8 sq ft ), a weight of 660 grammes (1 45 pounds), and a depth of\ncurvature equal to one-tenth their width This construction offered a two-fold advantage in its resistance to\nboth torsion and bagging, for as the pressures upon the wing were\nnearly balanced about the middle rib, the tendency to twist was\nreduced to a minimum, while the bagging, which results from the\nbending of the framework, as distinct from [p087] its twisting, was\ngreatly reduced by the manner in which the frame was put together,\nthe whole construction permitting a return to the system of wire\nguying at first adopted, which had been found inapplicable to a wing\nhaving but a single longitudinal rib forming its front margin When\ncompleted, the wings were strongly guyed with piano wire, both\nabove and below, to guy-posts attached to the midrod, and each cross-\nrib was separately guyed with wire chords Although these wings had\ncost much in time and labor, and contained many points of\nimprovement, they were eventually found to be too weak to support\nthe aerodrome, and were therefore abandoned without a trial in the\nfield For the plane horizontal tail hitherto used a pair of curved wings\nwas substituted, similar in all respects to those just described, but\nhaving only half their area, and these were later replaced by a pair\nequal in size and in every way the counterpart of the front wings The\ntail as hitherto used accordingly disappeared, and gave place to\nanother having a wholly different function to perform; for while the\nold tail, like the rear pair of wings which superseded it, was intended\nto bear a definite part of the weight of the aerodrome, the new tail\nwhich was now added behind the rear pair of wings was not supposed\nto bear any part whatever of the weight, but to act solely as a guide,\nand this new feature, first introduced in October, 1895, was continued\nto the end This arrangement of the surfaces is quite different from that\nadopted by Pénaud in 1872, in which the tail became automatic in its\naction through its small angle of elevation as compared with that of\nthe wings, while still acting as a supporting surface, whereas in the\npresent arrangement the function of the tail was solely one of\nguidance This, I believe, was one of the important changes which\nperhaps as much as any other led to final success During the fall of 1895 a large number of experiments were made\nboth in free flight with gliding models, and in constrained flight with\nthe whirling-table, to determine the relative lifting power of the front\nand rear wings per unit of area, and from these the following new\nrules were deduced for finding the center of pressure:\nIf a following wing is the size of the leader, assume that its\nefficiency is 66 per cent per unit of surface If it is half the size of the leader, assume that its efficiency is 50 per\ncent per unit of surface If it is half as large again as the leader, assume that its efficiency is\n80 per cent per unit of surface For intermediate sizes of surface, proportionate values per unit of\nsurface may be assumed If we consider the area of the front wing to be unity, and that of the\nrear wing to be n, and if m be the efficiency of the rear wing per unit\nof surface, [p088] the above is expressed in the following formulæ,\nwhich it will be remembered take account only of wings following\neach other in the same or nearly the same plane, and are not\napplicable where one wing is either above or below the plane of the\nother In the formulæ, CP is the resultant center of pressure upon both\nwings expressed in the notation described in Chapter II ◊, CPfw is the\ncenter of pressure of the front wings, and CPrw the center of pressure\nof the rear wings",

    "These wings were subsequently used in the first\nsuccessful flights of the following year PL 17 AERODROME NO 5 PLAN OF WINGS AND SYSTEM OF GUYING ◊\n[p089]\nDuring the year 1895 but two field-trials were made with the steam\naerodromes, and neither of these was successful; but a great step\nforward had been taken in the construction, guying and arrangement\nof the sustaining surfaces The wings had been made stronger with no\nincrease in weight per unit of area On the contrary, the ratio of\nweight of sustaining surfaces to area had been actually reduced from\n43 to 28 grammes per square foot, so that the surfaces were both\nlighter and stronger Two longitudinal ribs had taken the place of the single one before\nused, a second wing clamp had been added to correspond to the\nmidrib, the difficult problem of torsion had been effectually solved,\nthe system of guying greatly improved, and it appeared that in the\nnext trial the wings might be expected to bear the weight of the\naerodrome without serious distortion 1896\nIn January, 1896, two new pairs of wings were designed for No 6,\nand in order to give a greater efficiency to the rear wings, they were\nmade larger than the front ones, the area of the latter being 22 square\nfeet, and of the former 27 square feet, and whereas the width of each\nwing had formerly been one-third of its length, it was now increased\nto two-fifths to correspond to those of No 5 The progress made in construction and guying is shown by the fact\nthat when on January 28 one pair of the wings of No",
    "The progress made in construction and guying is shown by the fact\nthat when on January 28 one pair of the wings of No 5 was inverted\nand sanded, the yielding at the tip was less than 5° greater than at the\nroot, whereas at one time it had been 65° A similar test applied to a\npair of wings of No 6 on March 4 gave even better results, as the\nyield at the root was but 1° 45′, and at the tip 2° 30′ The successive stages of the development of the wing clamps are\n\n\nshown in Fig 16 16 In its final form the front wing clamp, or that which\nheld the main front rib, shown at AB (1896), had adjustable sliding\npieces, by means of which the wings could be set at any desired angle\nof elevation, the wing as a whole revolving about the rear wing\nclamp, shown at CD (1896) The general system of guying the wings, as shown in Plate 17, had\nbeen greatly improved In the present form a bowsprit and guy-posts\nfirmly attached to the midrod furnished points of attachment for the\npiano wires with which the wings were guyed and held rigidly in\nplace, other wires being stretched across from wing to wing so as to\nmaintain them at a constant diedral angle of about 150° The clamps\nby which the guy-posts were attached to the midrod, are shown at EF\n(Fig 16) In the successful flights of No 5 on May 6, the completed wings\nalready described weighed together 1950 grammes (4 29 pounds),\nand had a total sustaining area of 6 4 square metres (68 8 square\nfeet), the flying weight of the [p090] aerodrome was 11,775 grammes\n(26 pounds), and the sustaining surfaces therefore amounted to 2 6\nsquare feet to the pound, which, as the event proved, was amply\nsufficient The “tail-rudder,” shown in Plate 17, comprised a vertical and\nhorizontal surface of silk intersecting in a central rod or axis, having a\nlength of 115 cm (3 8 feet) The framing was of spruce and consisted\nof two sets of four arms, each radiating from the central rod, the\nhexagonal outline of the surfaces being formed of piano wire, over\nwhich the silk was drawn and sewed The area of each surface was\nabout 0 6 square metres (6 45 square feet), and the total weight was\n371 grammes (0 8 pounds) A flat steel spring inserted in the forward end between the rudder\nand the midrod gave it a certain desirable degree of elasticity in a\nvertical direction The rudder was held in place by a pin passing\nthrough the midrod, and was so set as to coincide with the line of\ndirect flight, its purpose, as already explained, being to guide the\naerodrome, but to take no part in its sustention In balancing Aerodrome No 5 on May 6, the wings were so\nadjusted that in accordance with the notation given above, p 15:\nCPfw = 1575\n\n\nCPrw = 1415 5;\nand as the wings were of equal size, from what has preceded in the\npresent\nCP1 =\n3CPfw + 2CPrw\n5\n= 1501 2",
    "2 The center of gravity was located at 1497, so that there should have\nbeen a very slight tendency on the part of the aerodrome to rise, as\nwas actually the case The formula was perhaps not quite so accurate\nas the prolonged flight of the aerodrome would seem to indicate, as it\ntakes no account of the thrust of the propellers, which in action\ntended to elevate the aerodrome in front while their resistance would\ntend to depress it when they had ceased to revolve, which\nconsideration accounts for the action of the aerodrome on May 6, as\ndescribed in Chapter IX ◊ The formula may, however, be regarded as\napproximately correct In the final successful trial with No In the final successful trial with No 6 on November 28, 1896, the\nwings used were similar in general construction and manner of guying\nto those of No 5 on May 6, but, as shown in the photograph (Plate\n29A, Chapter X), the front rib at its outer extremity was bent to a\nquadrant to connect with the midrib, this construction being\nsomewhat stronger than that adopted in the wings of No 5 The\ncurvature was but one-eighteenth of the width of the wing instead of\none-twelfth as in No 5 The front and rear pairs were similar and\nequal and had a combined area of 5 square metres (54 sq ft ), and a\nweight of 2154 grammes [p091] (4 74 lbs ) The flying weight of the\naerodrome was 12,120 grammes (26 7 lbs ), the sustaining surface\nthus amounting to slightly more than 2 square feet to the pound The position of the wings, in accordance with the notation adopted,\nwas\nCPfw = 1563 2,\nCPrw = 1374 Since the wings were equal in size,\nCP1 =\n3CPfw + 2CPrw\n5\n\n\n = 1487 5 The center of gravity was located at 1484, which was 3 5 cm in the\nrear of the center of pressure The flight was approximately\nhorizontal, and the setting seems to have been as accurate as could be\ndesired The angle of elevation of the wings at the root was 10° 30′,\nand so well were they guyed that there was no visible yielding at any\npoint during the flight As the midrod during flight was approximately\nhorizontal the angle of elevation of the wings may be taken as 10° 30′;\nthe efficiency of the rear wings was two-thirds that of the front wings,\nand the effective area was therefore\n27+27×\n2\n3\n = 45 square feet The wings being very nearly plane we have therefore the data for\ndetermining the soaring speed from the formula of “Aerodynamics”\n(Chapter VI, p 60) W = Pα cos α = kAV2F(α) cos α,\nin which W = 26 7 pounds; A = 45 sq ft ; k = 0 00166; α = 10°\n30′; F (α) cos α = 0 353 By substituting these values in the formula\nwe obtain V = 32 feet per second The speed actually attained, however, was about 30 miles an hour,\nor 44 feet per second, which seems to indicate that the angle of\nelevation under pressure was reduced to much less than 10° 30′ For a\nvelocity of 44 feet per second, the theoretical value of α would be but\n6° In this calculation, however, the hull resistance and that of the\nsystem of guy-wires, which must have been comparatively large, has\nbeen omitted It would appear, therefore, that the actual results\nobtainable in flight are much more favorable than calculations based\non experimental data would presuppose ◊\n[p092]\nCHAPTER IX\nHISTORY OF LAUNCHING APPARATUS AND FIELD-TRIALS OF\nAERODROMES 4, 5 AND 6\nLAUNCHING\nAPPARATUS\nI have elsewhere mentioned that the difficulties of launching even a\nvery small model aerodrome are considerable Early experiments were\ntried with an apparatus something like a gigantic cross-bow, and in\nlater years with various forms of pendulum, all of which latter\nbrought out the inherent theoretical defect of the movement of\nrotation of the aerodrome, and were otherwise practically inefficient A device, consisting of two pendulums, one behind the other,\nconnected by a rigid rod, from which the aerodrome could be\nsuspended and cast off without rotation, was at one time considered,\nbut abandoned Experiments were also made with several forms of\nrailroad, upon which the aerodrome was to run up to the moment of\nrelease, before the form of launching apparatus, which finally proved\nsuccessful, was adopted All these had failed chiefly for two reasons; first, it was difficult to\ncause the aerodrome to be released just at the moment it attained\nsufficient speed to soar; second, the extensive surface presented to the\nwind by the wings of the aerodrome, made it necessary to provide\nmeans for holding the machine securely at several points up to the\nmoment of release without danger of interfering in any way with the\naerodrome when it was cast into the air This proved a serious\nproblem, which can be appreciated only by one who has seen such a\nmachine in the open air, where its wings are subject to movement and\ndistortion by the slightest breeze The steps by which these difficulties\nwere removed and the final type of launching apparatus perfected are\nrecorded in the following pages in connection with the field-trials of\nthe model aerodromes 1892\nAs the end of the year 1892 approached and with it the completion\n\n\nof an aerodrome of large size which had to be started upon its flight\nin some way, the method and place of launching it pressed for\ndecision One thing at least seemed clear In the present stage of\nexperiment, it was desirable that the aerodrome should-—if it must\nfall-—fall into water where it would suffer little injury and be readily\nrecovered, rather than anywhere on land, where it would almost\ncertainly be badly damaged [p093]\nThe shores of the Potomac on both banks were scrutinized for this\npurpose, from a point about two miles above Washington to below\nChopawamsic Island, some thirty miles below the city Several lofty\nand secluded positions were found, but in all these there was the\ndanger that the aerodrome might be wrecked before reaching the\nwater, or, turning in its course, fly inland; but more than this, it could\nbe launched only on the rare occasions when the exact wind was\nblowing which the local conditions demanded Finally, the idea, which seems obvious enough when stated,\npresented itself of building a kind of house-boat, not to get up initial\nmotion by the boat’s own velocity, but to furnish an elevated\nplatform, which could be placed in the midst of a considerable\nexpanse of water, if desired, under conditions which admitted of\nturning in the direction of the wind, as it need hardly be repeated that\nit was indispensable to the machine, as it is to the bird, to rise in the\nface of a wind, if there be any wind at all The house-boat in question was nothing more than a scow about 30\nfeet long by 12 feet wide, upon which a small house was erected, to\nbe used for the occasional storing of the aerodromes On account of\nthe accidents which were certain to occur in the first attempts, it was\nfitted up with the means of making small repairs On the roof of the\nhouse there was a platform upon which the operator stood when\nmaking a launch, and upon which were mounted the launching\ndevices hereafter described This boat, shown in Plate 18, was completed in November, 1892 1893\nBy the kindness of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, the\nhouse-boat was towed in May, 1893, down to Chopawamsic Island, a\nsmall island near the western bank of the Potomac River, not far from\n\n\nthe Quantico station of the Washington and Richmond Railroad\nCompany A map of the island and the adjacent land and water is\nshown in Plate 19 The house-boat was at all times moored somewhere on the west\nside of the island, in the stretch of quiet water between that and the\nwest shore of the river The waters shown here are, with the exception\nof a narrow channel, very shallow, and, indeed, partly dry at low tide,\nso that there was no danger of an aerodrome being lost, unless its\nflight carried it a long distance away and over the land FIELD\nTRIALS\n29\nAerodrome No 4, as shown in Plate 11, had a single midrod, a\nflying weight of 9 pounds,30 and supporting surface, consisting of\nwings and tail, of 18 square feet [p094] Its engines, with about 100\npounds pressure, developed an aggregate of 0 4 H P , and lifted 50\nper cent of the flying weight The propellers were 60 cm (2 feet) in\ndiameter and\n1\n1\n4\npitch ratio The aerodrome was intended to be launched by a contrivance called\nthe “starter,” which was an inclined rod, hinged at the bottom, on the\ntop of which the aerodrome was supported on a rod which was\nthrown down at the instant of flight, giving the aerodrome a slight\nforward impulse, with the expectation that it would get up sufficient\ninitial speed to soar from the action of its propellers",
    "The aerodrome was intended to be launched by a contrivance called\nthe “starter,” which was an inclined rod, hinged at the bottom, on the\ntop of which the aerodrome was supported on a rod which was\nthrown down at the instant of flight, giving the aerodrome a slight\nforward impulse, with the expectation that it would get up sufficient\ninitial speed to soar from the action of its propellers On November 18 the writer (L), with Dr Barus (B) and the two\nmechanics (R and M), went to Quantico by an early train, and\nsuperintended with interested expectation the arrangements for this\nfirst trial in the open air of the mechanism which had now been over\ntwo years in preparation We met with an unexpected difficulty—that of launching the\naerodrome at all, for though the wind was only a very gentle breeze,\nit was only by holding it down with the hands that it was possible to\nkeep the aerodrome in position for the launch, during the few minutes\nwhich passed from the time it was placed upon the apparatus to the\n\n\ntime of releasing it Whether the launching device itself might be\neffective or not could not be ascertained, since it was found that\nnothing which could even be called an attempt to launch could be\nmade except in an absolute calm; a condition of things very difficult\nfor any one to understand who has not passed through the experience The writer returned to Washington at the close of the day without\nhaving done anything, but having learned a great deal November 20 L, with B and M, came down again, and waited until\n4 20, when, the breeze having fallen to almost a calm, the aerodrome\nwas maintained in place on the launching apparatus with great\ndifficulty, while it was repeatedly set on fire by the scattering liquid\nfuel Finally it was let go, and fell close to the house-boat, the tail\nstriking the edge of the platform The immediate cause of failure was\nthe defective launching apparatus, for the design of which the writer\nfelt himself responsible",
    "The immediate cause of failure was\nthe defective launching apparatus, for the design of which the writer\nfelt himself responsible November 24 L, with B, M, and R came down again to Quantico,\nbut the very moderate wind proved completely prohibitory to any\nattempt at launching, and all returned again to Washington November 27 L, with B and M, came down to try a new launching\napparatus, not different in principle from the preceding one, but of\nbetter construction The morning was exceptionally calm, but the\nengines were found to be out of order, and precious time was spent in\nslight repairs which should have been made in the shop At 3 30 p m , when the engines were at last ready, the exceptional calm gave\nplace to a very gentle and almost imperceptible breeze, [p095] which,\nnevertheless, again proved prohibitory to the launching, and with\nextreme disappointment the party returned to Washington, it being at\nlast fully recognized that unless some ways were found of holding\ndown all the extended supporting surfaces upon the launching piece,\nand at the same time of firmly clamping the body of the aerodrome\nuntil it could be dropped, as well as of releasing all this\nsimultaneously at the critical instant, no attempt at launching was\nlikely to succeed except in such an entire and perfect calm as rarely\noccurs Independent of this launching difficulty, some way of\nprotecting the fires from the wind had to be found, which was by no\nmeans easy, since an efficient protection meant an enclosure of them\nand a diminished influx of air, of which it was essential that there\n\n\nshould be an unlimited supply December 1 L, with B, R, and M proceeded to Quantico The same\nconditions presented themselves and the party returned, without\neffecting anything December 7 L, B, R, and M present; day overcast but perfectly\ncalm Taught by experience, we had everything ready, and a little\nafter one o’clock the launch was made The aerodrome fell directly\ninto the boat, the rod of the starter having broken It was little\ndamaged, but in view of the injury and the rising wind, all other\nattempts were abandoned for the day December 11 Present, L, with B, R, and M A new “starter” had\nbeen devised and brought down, but was not yet quite ready for use,\nand an attempt was made to employ the old one with the\nimprovements suggested by experience, but, after two attempts to\nlaunch, the work was abandoned for the day, owing this time not to\nthe launching apparatus, but to troubles in the engines and pumps,\ndue probably to injuries received in the fall of the 7th, which were not\ndetected until the time of the actual trial December 20 L, with B, M, and G, present; engine and aerodrome\nin order and everything apparently favorable What seemed to be an\nalmost entire calm came toward evening, yet once more the all but\nimperceptible breeze which prevailed was found to defeat all\narrangements for holding the aerodrome to the launching ways before\nit was let go Trips to Quantico were also made on November 24, and December\n1 and 21, of which no account is given as the very moderate wind\nwhich prevailed in each case precluded any attempt at launching the\naerodrome It will be seen that eight trips were made to Quantico, and that, far\nfrom any flight having been made, not once even was the aerodrome\nlaunched at all The principal cause for this lay in the unrecognized\namount of difficulty introduced by the very smallest wind, irrespective\nof the unfitness of the launching apparatus to give the desired initial\nspeed and direction In all these trials, the aerodrome rested on the launching apparatus,\nby which it was projected forward by means of a spring in such a way\nas not to interfere with the propellers [p096]\n\n\nPrevious tests with the rubber-driven models had demonstrated the\nfutility of all simple pendulum types of “cast off,” and likewise all the\ntrials hitherto of a railroad form of launching apparatus, in which the\naerodrome was mounted on a car, which had itself to get out of the\nway, were equally failures, so that when the device referred to above\nproved to be worthless, it seemed that almost every plan had been\nexhausted There were, moreover, other difficulties, some of which\nhave been indicated above, such as that of making the burners work\nproperly in even a moderate wind during the very short time required\nfor attaching the wings and so adjusting the aerodrome on the\nlaunching apparatus These difficulties, which, now that they have been overcome, seem\ndifficulties no longer, but which then seemed insuperable, were all\nconnected with the ever-present problem of weight It would have\nbeen easy to make rigid sustaining surfaces which would not bend in\nthe wind; to make fires which would not go out; and easy to overcome\nall the impediments which seem so trivial in description and were so\nformidable in practice, were it not that the mandate of absolute\nnecessity forbade this being done by any contrivance which would\nadd to the weight of an already phenomenally light construction The\ndifficulties of the flight as they were seen in the workshop were\nmultiplied, then, beyond measure by the actual experiments in the\nfield, and the year closed with a most discouraging outlook 1894\nThe new year began without any essential improvement in the\nmeans already described, though a new launching apparatus had been\ndevised by the writer, which was scarcely so much an apparatus for\nlaunching, in the ordinary sense of the word, as one of holding the\naerodrome out over the water, and simply letting it drop from a\nheight of about 25 feet, during which fall it was hoped (exact data\nbeing unobtainable in advance of experiment) that there would be\ntime for the propellers to give the aerodrome the necessary soaring\nspeed before reaching the water This device consisted of an inverted\ntripod, which held the aerodrome comparatively steady by three\nbearing points, while a cross-bar of wood was added to prevent the\nwings from swaying before the launch Previously, the supporting\n\n\nsurfaces, wings and tail, had been put on only at the last minute Now\nit became possible to keep them on in a gentle breeze for an indefinite\ntime before launching January 9 The previous day having been spent in practicing the\nsteps preliminary to launching, so as to avoid delay in assembling and\nmounting the aerodrome, the writer, with Dr Graham Bell, went to\nQuantico The day was calm, and every condition seemed favorable The aerodrome was dropped fairly, under full steam, and it fell in a\nnearly horizontal position, but touched the water at a distance of only\n50 or 60 feet, evidently before the necessary initial speed [p097] could\nbe impressed on it by its engines The conclusion should have been\nthat by this method nothing but a practically unsuitable height would\nsuffice to start the aerodrome in a calm, though it might perhaps be\ndone in the face of a considerable breeze",
    "The conclusion should have been\nthat by this method nothing but a practically unsuitable height would\nsuffice to start the aerodrome in a calm, though it might perhaps be\ndone in the face of a considerable breeze May 25 May 25 After a considerable interval of delay, due to the river\nbeing closed by ice and other causes, Aerodrome No 4 was again\ndropped from the starter under nearly the same conditions as in the\ntrial of January 9, and with a quite similar result, the final conclusion\nbeing that this method must be abandoned It may be added that a\nvertical rudder was tried on this day June 12 No 4, with an improved blast, was tried at Quantico, Mr Goode being present The day ended in failure from another cause, the\nimproved blast, which worked well in the shelter of the shop, but\nproved useless in the field, being extinguished by the feeblest wind At\nthis time (in June and July) I designed a horizontal railroad with\nlaunching springs and track, underneath which ran a car which held\nthe aerodrome firmly until the moment of automatic release This\napparatus finally proved to be the successful solution of the launching\nproblem The description given later, with the drawing in Plate 18,\nshows the after-improvements, but no specific change from that in use\nfrom the first About this time I also arranged for certain changes in the boilers\nand burners, having decided that I would not go into the field without\nsome ground for confidence not only that the aerodrome could be\nlaunched successfully, but that a steady flame could be maintained\nunder the boilers October 6 No 4, as remodelled, having a flying weight of about\n\n\n14 5 pounds, a supporting surface of about 28 square feet, with a total\nengine power of about 0 5 H P , and having lifted 40 per cent of its\nweight on the pendulum, was taken down the river for trial with the\nnew railroad launching apparatus, and several days were spent in\nerecting the launching apparatus on the house-boat, and in launching\n“dummy” aerodromes from it for practice Aerodrome No 4 then being fitted under conditions which\napparently insured a good start (the center of pressure being nearly\nover the center of gravity, the root angle of the wing being zero, the\nmidrod nearly horizontal, the engine working well, and with\napparently ample sustaining surface) was finally successfully\nlaunched, but the hopes which were reasonably entertained proved to\nbe unfounded The result of this first actual trial of a “flying machine”\nin free air was most disconcerting, for the aerodrome, which had in\ntheory many times the power required for horizontal flight, plunged\ninto the water with its engines working at full speed, after a course\nhardly longer than that performed by the dummy This result was at\nfirst inexplicable No 4, then, did not fly at all, from some at first inscrutable cause,\nand it was decided to make a trial of No 5, though it was hard to put\nthe result of so much [p098] time, painstaking and cost to the hazard\nof destruction With the experience just acquired from the trial of No 4, the wing of No 5 was set at an angle of about 20° with the midrod,\nand the tip was secured by a light cross-piece, so guyed that the wing\nas a whole, while set at this considerably greater angle with the rod,\nwas stiffer than before In addition to this, the air chamber was moved\nback so that the center of gravity was from 6 to 10 cm behind the\n(calculated) center of pressure These changes were made in order to\ninsure that the front should at any rate keep up, and it did The aerodrome was launched successfully with the engines working\nunder a pressure of 110 pounds of steam The head rose continually\nuntil the mid-rod stood up at an angle of about 60°, checking all\nfurther advance It remained in the air in a stationary position for\nnearly a second, and then slid backward into the water, striking on the\nend of the rudder and bending it The distance flown was about 12\nmetres, and the time of flight 3 seconds One of the propellers was\nbroken short off, and the shaft was bent It thus became clearly evident that some cause prevented the proper\nbalancing of the machine, which was necessary to secure even\napproximately the theoretically simple condition of horizontal flight It was all-important that the angle of the front wing should be correct,\nbut its position could not be accurately known in advance of\nexperiment, and this experiment could only be made with the\nmachine itself, and involved the risk of wrecking it These trials gave a very vivid object lesson of what had already\nbeen anticipated,31 that the difficulties of actual flight would probably\nlie even more in obtaining exact balance than in the first and more\nobvious difficulty of obtaining the mere engine power to sustain a\nmachine in the air The immediate problem was to account for the\ntotally different behavior of the two aerodromes in the two flights,\nunder not very different conditions Observations of the movement of the two aerodromes through the\nair, as seen by the writer from the shore, seemed to show, however,\nthat the wings did not remain in their original form, but that at the\nmoment of launching there was a sudden flexure and distortion due to\nthe upward pressure of the air The time of flight was too short, and\nthe speed too great, to be sure of just what did occur, but it seemed\nprobable that the wings flexed under the initial pressure of the weight\nwhich came upon them at the moment of launching, and that they\nwere in fact, while in the air, a wholly different thing from what they\nwere an instant before, so that a very slight initial difference in the\nangle at which they first met the air might cause the air to strike in\nthe one case on the top of the wings and throw the head down, and in\nthe other case so as to throw the head up To ascertain the extent and\ncharacter of this flexure, caused, it will be observed, by [p099] the\nweight of the aerodrome suddenly thrown on the wings, I inverted the\naerodrome and distributed a weight of dry sand equal to that of the\nwhole machine evenly over the supporting surfaces It was found that\nunder the weight of the sand the extremity of the wings bent to an\nangle of 45° downwards (and consequently must have bent to an\nangle of 45° upwards in the air), a condition of affairs worse than\nanything that had been suspected, and seeming to demand the entire\nreconstruction of the wings with a strength and consequent weight for\nwhich there was no means of providing There had been some injuries to the machines in the trials of the\n5th and 6th, and these were repaired A new float had been made for\nNo 4, and a new set of larger

    "Once more it\nwas shown beyond dispute that the wings must somehow be made\n\n\neven stiffer December 8 Another trial was undertaken with No 5, the CG being\n10 cm in front of the CP at rest The root angle of the wings was 18°,\ntip angle 27°, elevation of midrod 1 in 24 The other changes made\nsince the previous trial consisted chiefly in the increased weight due\nto the longer and stronger frames and shafts that were made to carry\n100 cm propellers The flight obtained was so short that it was as\nunsatisfactory as before The aerodrome rose in the air after leaving the launching apparatus,\nand then slid back into the water in the plane of its own wings On the\nfirst trial, it struck the boat, and was slightly injured; on the second,\nwith root angle of [p101] wings 10°, tip angle 20°, the flight partook of\nthe same character, but the machine struck the water clear of the\nboat The fact that with the CG 10 cm in advance of the calculated CP\nthe aerodrome steadily rose in front, seems to indicate that the rule\nused at that time for calculating the CP (see Chapter II ◊) was not\nvery accurate This rule was based upon the assumption that the tail,\nhaving an area equal to one-third the entire sustaining surface,\nsupported one-third the total weight (expressed by the formula\nCP =\n2CPwm + CPtm\n3\n,\nwhere CPwm and CPtm represent respectively the CP of the wings and\ntail in motion), and that the CP of each surface was one-fifth its width\nin front of the center of figure",
    "This rule was based upon the assumption that the tail,\nhaving an area equal to one-third the entire sustaining surface,\nsupported one-third the total weight (expressed by the formula\nCP =\n2CPwm + CPtm\n3\n,\nwhere CPwm and CPtm represent respectively the CP of the wings and\ntail in motion), and that the CP of each surface was one-fifth its width\nin front of the center of figure December 12 Four days later, the tail had been moved back 21 cm ,\nthus carrying the CG back 7 cm , but the vertical rudder (weighing\n105 grammes), for which there was now no room, was taken off,\nwhich in a measure counteracted this change A trial was then made with the wings set at an initial angle of 8° at\nthe root and 20° at the tip The aerodrome was released with the\nengines working under a steam pressure of 90 pounds, and soared off\nhorizontally for some distance, when suddenly it swerved to the right\nas though something on that side had given out, and turning quite\nthrough 180° headed toward the boat, striking the water about 76 feet\naway The time of the flight was 4 seconds It was found upon the recovery of the machine that one of the\npropellers had been twisted through 90°, so that the two were no\nlonger symmetrical The turning may have been due to this twist or to\nunequal influence of the wind upon the two wings; for when I applied\nthe sand test to the wings after returning them to Washington, it was\nfound that they deflected so much that the grains would not lie upon\nthem, which, to a great extent, explains the failure to secure a better\nflight Thus the end of another year had been reached, and what might be\ncalled a real flight had not yet been secured The only progress that\nseemed to have been made was that the aerodromes were not quite so\nunmanageable and erratic in their flights as at the beginning of the\nyear, and that it had been demonstrated, at least to the writer’s\nsatisfaction, that the power was sufficient for the work to be done The launching device had been so perfected that it worked\nsatisfactorily, but the problem of balancing seemed as far from\nsolution as before 1895\nWhile, for convenience in narrating the progress of the work with\nthe aerodromes, each year has been treated as a unit, it is, of course,\nunderstood that the work itself shows no especial difference between\nthe closing of one year and the beginning of another Changes which\nhad important effects were introduced [p102] at various times, but\nwere, of course, made as they suggested themselves without any\nreference to time or season But while it was customary to make, from\ntime to time, a résumé of the progress of the work, yet at the closing\nof the calendar year it was the custom to make a more complete\ndigest of just what had been accomplished during the year Upon thus reviewing the progress of the work during 1894, it was\nfelt that the results which had been accomplished for such a large\nexpenditure of time seemed small, since no real flight had been made\nby any of the aerodromes, and no definite assurance that a successful\nflight would be obtained within the immediate future seemed\nwarranted by what had already been accomplished But now that the\nprincipal difficulties connected with the launching apparatus had been\novercome, thus permitting the aerodromes themselves to be given a\n\n\nfair trial, the belief was encouraged that the continuance of the actual\ntests of the machines, with slight changes which previous tests had\nshown advisable, would finally result in a successful flight The early weeks of 1895 were spent in a series of pendulum tests on\nNo 5, and in making such slight changes as these tests indicated\nwould be advisable As a result of small improvements introduced in\nthe boilers, No 5 had by the middle of March shown a repeated lift of\nconsiderably over 50 per cent, and in some tests as much as 62 per\ncent of its flying weight Certain radical changes previously described\nin Chapter VII ◊ were also made in Aerodrome No 4, and in the\npendulum tests of it a lift of 44 per cent of its flying weight had been\nobtained Encouraged by the better results which the aerodromes had shown\nin the above tests, it was decided to test them again in free flight, and\nthey were accordingly sent down to Quantico in charge of the two\nmechanics, R and M, Mr Langley, accompanied by Dr Graham Bell,\nwhom he had invited to witness the tests, following on May 8 On the\nevening of May 8 No 5 was mounted on the launching apparatus in\norder to drill the mechanics so that when favorable weather presented\nitself the aerodrome could be got ready for launching with the\nminimum delay On May 9 Mr Langley and Dr Bell reached the house-boat at 5 a",
    "Bell reached the house-boat at 5 a m m , but even with the drill of the previous evening the mechanics\nwere not able to have No 5 ready for trial until 6 15 a m The\nprincipal conditions of No The\nprincipal conditions of No 5 at this time were:\nTotal weight 11,200 grammes (24 6 pounds), including 800 grammes of\nfuel and water Previous lift on the pendulum 54 per cent, with a steam\npressure of 150 pounds With this steam pressure the engine made about\n600 R P M when driving the 95 cm propellers, which through their\nreduction gearing made about 500 R P M M [p103]\nWhen the aerodrome was balanced for flight so as to bring the\ntheoretical “center of pressure in motion” over the center of gravity, it\nwas found that it was not possible to carry the center of gravity in\nfront of this point, although it was known by experience to be\nnecessary Accordingly in the first trial the outer ends of the tail were\npressed down by the guys so that the wind of advance tended to lift\nthe tail and throw the head down more than if the tail had been flat Furthermore, the float, weighing 200 grammes, instead of being\nplaced in its normal position near the base of the bowsprit, was\ncarried out to its extremity, this change in the position of the float\nalone being sufficient to carry the center of gravity forward three or\nfour centimetres The curved wings were set at an angle of nine\ndegrees at the root and eleven degrees at the tip They were well\nguyed, and in flight appeared to be not materially twisted or altered It was anticipated that the pressing down of the outer ends of the\ntail and the shifting of the center of gravity would cause the\naerodrome to point downward in flight, and this anticipation was\nverified in the test At 6 15 a m the aerodrome was launched at a\nsteam pressure of 120 pounds A perfect calm prevailed at the time\nand the machine started straight ahead There was no perceptible\ndrop at the moment it was released from the launching car, but a\nsmooth and steady descent until it struck the water, nose down, at a\npoint approximately 200 feet from the boat",
    "There was no perceptible\ndrop at the moment it was released from the launching car, but a\nsmooth and steady descent until it struck the water, nose down, at a\npoint approximately 200 feet from the boat Dr Dr Bell noted that the\nlength of time the aerodrome was in the air was 2 8 seconds One of\nthe propellers was broken and the other one was found to have\ntwisted its shaft one-fourth of a turn At 9 45 a m , the wings having been dried, No 5 was again tried The float was moved back to its normal position at the base of the\nbowsprit, and the guys, by which the outer ends of the tail had been\ndepressed in the previous trial, were so adjusted that the tail was flat The machine was, therefore, in the condition of theoretical\nequilibrium for rapid motion with a plane wing All the other\nconditions were precisely as in the previous trial, except that the\nround-end 100-centimetre propellers were substituted for the 95-\ncentimetre ones which had been broken, and a new paper-covered tail\nwas used The mechanic in charge was directed to let the steam reach\nits highest pressure consistent with a flight of one-half a minute,\nbefore launching the machine, but he seemed to have lost all sense of\nthe length of time the fuel and water would last, as he let the engines\nrun until almost the whole charge was exhausted before launching it The aerodrome went off almost horizontally, then turned up into the\nwind and rose to an angle of about twenty degrees; then (while\nmoving forward) slowly sank as though the engine power had given\nout, as in fact it doubtless had The actual distance travelled was 123\n\n\nfeet and the length of time 7 2 seconds",
    "2 seconds While the exhaustion of the\nfuel and water prior to launching the machine had prevented what\napparently would otherwise have been an [p104] exceedingly good\nflight, yet the fact that the aerodrome rose immediately after being\nlaunched, and continued to do so until the power gave out, was in\nitself very encouraging At 1 40 p m No 5 was again ready for trial (the third one for the\nday), and this time Mr Langley and Dr Bell witnessed it from a\ngreater distance in hopes of being able more clearly to study its\nbehavior when actually in the air The previous trial having missed success through the fuel and water\nhaving been consumed before the machine was launched, special\ninstructions were given to avoid the recurrence of this mistake But\nthe machine was held for probably two minutes after the burners were\nlighted, with very much the same result as before The conditions of\nthe aerodrome were the same as in the previous trial, except that the\ntail was a little flatter, so as to tend to make the head slightly lower in\nflight It was launched at an angle of about thirty degrees with the\nvery gentle wind that was blowing, and, apparently under the\ndirection of the rudder, turned into the wind, the midrod rising to an\nangle of about twenty degrees and (as noted in Mr Langley’s record\nbook) “The whole machine absolutely rising during five or six seconds\n—a fine spectacle Then the power visibly gave out, the propellers\nrevolving slower It settled forward and lost nearly all of its forward\nmotion at the end of about seven seconds, but did not finally touch\nthe water until ten and a quarter seconds ”\nWhile the length of time that the aerodrome had been sustained in\nthe air was so short that no actual flight had really been achieved, yet\nthe results encouraged the belief that with the aerodrome more\naccurately balanced, it could reasonably be hoped that a somewhat\nlonger flight would be obtained It was, however, very evident that,\nalthough the correct balancing which would insure equilibrium for a\nfew minutes might soon be attained, the machine, lacking a human\nintelligence to control it, must be provided with some mechanism\nwhich would tend to restore the equilibrium, the conditions of which\nmust necessarily change in a machine depending on the air for its\nsupport In order to see what could be done in this direction, it was,\n\n\ntherefore, decided to return immediately to Washington with the\nmachines and make some minor changes in them before attempting\nfurther flights",
    "In order to see what could be done in this direction, it was,\n\n\ntherefore, decided to return immediately to Washington with the\nmachines and make some minor changes in them before attempting\nfurther flights By the end of May, Nos 4 and 5 were again in readiness for a trial,\nand the mechanics were accordingly sent to Quantico to complete\npreparations for the tests During May Mr A M Herring, who had\nbeen experimenting with model machines for several years, was\nengaged for a few months as an assistant, and he was immediately put\nin charge of the field trials of Nos 4 and 5, which were now about to\nbe made On June 6 Mr Langley, accompanied by Mr Herring, went\nto Quantico, and on June 7, at 5 a m , Aerodrome No 5 was ready\nfor trial, but the wind was so high that nothing could be done The\nwind later diminished in intensity, but the house-boat had become\nstuck on the beach [p105] and it was impossible to make the launching\napparatus point directly into the wind, which was blowing from the\nrear of the boat An attempt was made to launch the aerodrome even\nwith the wind blowing at its rear, but it was found impossible to make\nthe fires burn and the test was accordingly postponed Later in the\nafternoon the house-boat was floated and the preparations for a test\nwere immediately completed At 5 42 p m the fires were lighted, but\nthe burners did not work properly and the proper steam pressure\ncould not be obtained At 6 20 p m the fires were again lighted, and\nat 6 22 the aerodrome was launched, its midrod having an upward\nangle of 25 degrees, or more, with the launching track The\naerodrome moved off nearly horizontally, but seemed to be very\nsluggish in its movement and fell in the water about seventy feet from\nthe boat, after having been in the air only 4 8 seconds The damage\nconsisted of a broken propeller and a slight strain in the main frame,\nthe extent of which, however, was not immediately seen The steam pressure at the time of launching was 110 pounds, which\nwas obviously insufficient The aerodrome had lifted fifty per cent of\nits weight on the pendulum, and its sluggishness of movement\nseemed, therefore, unaccountable even for this pressure It seemed\nprobable, however, that the pressure ran down immediately after the\nmachine was launched, on account either of the use of the light-\nweight burners in place of the larger and heavier ones, or of the\ndiminution of the air pressure in the gas tank At 7 55 the aerodrome was again launched, and this time made a\nstill shorter flight than before, being in the air only three seconds A\nserious leak in the engine cylinder was, however, discovered just as\nthe machine was launched, and this probably accounted for the lack\nof power Not only had the tests which have just been described indicated\nthat there was a lack of power during flight, although previous\npendulum tests had repeatedly shown lifts greater than fifty per cent,\nbut, furthermore, the wings themselves, while appearing perfectly\ncapable of supporting the aerodrome when viewed with the machine\nstationary, were seen to flex to such an extent in flight that it seemed\nprobable that much of the power was consumed in merely overcoming\nthe head resistance of a large portion of the wings which had lost all\nlifting effect During the fall and winter, as recorded in Chapters VII and VIII ◊,\nAerodrome “New No 4,” which had been reconstructed during the\nsummer, and which upon test was found radically weak, was almost\nentirely rebuilt and afterwards known as No 6 Important changes\nwere also made in No 5, which greatly increased its strength and\npower The improvements, however, which contributed more than\nanything else to the marked success achieved in the next trial of the\naerodromes, were those which had to do with the nature and\ndisposition of the sustaining surfaces and the means for securing\nequilibrium [p106]\nIt will be recalled that in the more recent trials the apparent causes\nof failure had been the inability to provide sufficiently rigid wings,\nthe great difficulty of properly adjusting the relative positions of the\ncenters of pressure and gravity, and the lack of any means of\nregaining equilibrium when the balance of the aerodrome had in any\nway been disturbed In the fall of 1895, accordingly, it was finally\ndecided to employ a second pair of wings equal in size to the first or\nleading pair This not only added greatly to the stability of the\naerodrome, but also made it possible, without any alteration in the\nplan of the frame, to bring the center of pressure into the proper\nposition relative to the center of gravity In addition the plan of\nconstructing the wings was modified by the introduction of a second\nmain rib, which, placed at approximately the center of pressure of the\n\n\nwings, made them much stiffer, both against bending and torsion The\ntwo pairs of wings now became the sole means of support, and the tail\nwhich had hitherto been made to bear part of the weight of the\naerodrome, as well as assist in preserving the longitudinal\nequilibrium, was now intended to perform only the latter function It\nwas placed in the rear of the wings and was combined with the\nvertical rudder Further, in adjusting it on the aerodrome, it was set at\na small negative angle and given a certain degree of elasticity, as\ndescribed above This device proved to be a most efficient means of\nmaintaining and restoring the equilibrium, when it was disturbed, and\nits value was apparent in all future tests of the models 1896\nThe important changes in the steam-driven models which had been\nbegun in the previous fall, and which in the case of No 4 had been so\nextensive as to convert it into a new aerodrome, No 6, were\ncontinued during the early spring, and it was not until the last of April\nthat the models Nos 5 and 6 were ready for actual test in free flight PL 18 HOUSE-BOAT WITH OVERHEAD LAUNCHING APPARATUS, 1896 ◊\nThe condition of No 5, which made the first successful flight, is\ngiven in the data sheet for May 6, 1896, and its general form at this\ntime may be seen in the photograph of May 11, Plate 27A Although\nthe changes described above, as well as the modifications in the\nboilers and burners of both aerodromes had undoubtedly effected a\ngreat \nimprovement \nin \nevery \ndetail \nof \nthe \nmachines, \nthe\ndisappointments experienced in the preceding years prevented any\ngreat feeling of confidence that the trials which were now to be made\nwould be entirely successful On May 4, however, the two mechanics,\nMr Reed and Mr Maltby, were sent down to Quantico with\nAerodromes Nos 5 and 6, and Mr Langley, accompanied by Dr Graham Bell, who had been invited to witness the tests, followed on\nthe afternoon of the 5th On May 6 the wind was so very high all the\nmorning that a test was found impracticable During the forenoon,\nhowever, the wind gradually died down, and by 1 p m was blowing\nfrom six to ten miles an hour [p107] from the northeast At 1 10 p m Aerodrome No 6 was launched, but the guy-wire uniting the wings\n\n\nhaving apparently caught on one of the fixed wooden strips which\nheld the wings down, the left wing was broken before the aerodrome\nwas really launched, and the result was that the machine slowly\nsettled down in the water by the boat, breaking the propellers and\nslightly injuring the Pénaud tail After removing No 6 from the water, No 5 was placed on the\nlaunching car and immediately prepared for a test At 3 05 p m it\nwas launched at a steam pressure of 150 pounds and started directly\nahead into the gentle breeze which was then blowing The height of\nthe launching track above the water was about twenty feet Immediately after leaving the launching track, the aerodrome slowly\ndescended three or four feet, but immediately began to rise, its\nmidrod pointing upward at an increasing angle until it made about\nten degrees with the horizon and then remained remarkably constant\nat this angle through the flight Shortly after leaving the launching\ntrack the aerodrome began to circle to the right and moved around\nwith great steadiness, traversing a spiral path, as shown in the\ndiagram (Plate 19) From an inspection of the diagram it will be\nnoticed that the aerodrome made two complete turns and started on\nthe third one During the first two turns the machine was constantly\nand steadily ascending, and at the end of the second turn it had\nreached a height variously estimated by the different observers at\nfrom 70 to 100 feet When at this height, and after the lapse of one\nminute and twenty seconds, the propellers were seen to be moving\nperceptibly slower and the machine began to descend slowly, at the\nsame time moving forward and changing the angle of inclination of\nthe midrod until the bow pointed slightly downward It finally\ntouched the water to the south of the house-boat at the position\nshown, the time the machine was in the air having been one minute\nand thirty seconds from the moment of launching The distance\nactually traversed, as estimated by plotting its curved path on the\ncoast-survey chart and then measuring this path, was approximately\n3300 feet, which is the mean of three independent estimates This\nestimate of the distance was checked by noting the number of\nrevolutions of the propellers as recorded by the revolution counter,\nwhich was set in motion at the moment the machine was launched On the assumption that the slip of the propellers was not greater than\n\n\nfifty per cent, the 1166 revolutions as shown by the counter would\nindicate a distance travelled of 2430 feet As it was felt very certain\nthat the slip of the propellers could not have amounted to as much as\nfifty per cent, it seemed a conservative estimate to place the length of\nflight at 3000 feet, which would mean a rate of travel of between 20\nand 25 miles an hour The circular path traversed by the aerodrome\nwas accounted for by the fact that the guy-wires on one of the wings\nhad not been tightened up properly, thus causing a difference in the\nlifting effect of the two sides [p108]\nThe aerodrome was immediately recovered from the water and\npreparations made for a second test, the machine being launched\nagain at 5 10 p m at a steam pressure of 160 pounds The conditions\nwere the same as at the first trial, except that the wind had changed\nfrom north to south and was perhaps of less velocity than before The\npath traversed by the aerodrome in this second trial was almost a\nduplicate of the previous one, except that on account of the change in\nthe direction of the wind the machine was launched in the opposite\ndirection In tightening up the guy-wires, which had not been\nproperly adjusted in the previous test, they were probably tightened\nsomewhat too much, since in this second test the aerodrome circled\ntowards the left, whereas in the first flight it had circled towards the\nright The aerodrome made three complete turns, rising to a height of\napproximately sixty feet with its midrod inclined to the horizon at a\nslightly greater angle than before The propellers again ceased turning\nwhile the machine was high in the air and it glided forward and\ndownward and finally settled on the water after having been in the air\none minute and thirty-one seconds The distance travelled was\nestimated as before, by plotting the path on the coast-survey chart,\nand was found to be 2300 feet During these flights several photographs were secured of the\nmachine while it was actually in the air, some of the pictures being\ntaken by Dr",
    "During these flights several photographs were secured of the\nmachine while it was actually in the air, some of the pictures being\ntaken by Dr Bell and others by Mr F E Fowle The clearest of these\nare shown in Plates 20, 21, and 22 Just what these flights meant to Mr Langley can be readily\nunderstood They meant success For the first time in the history of\nthe world a device produced by man had actually flown through the\nair, and had preserved its equilibrium without the aid of a guiding\n\n\nhuman intelligence Not only had this device flown, but it had been\ngiven a second trial and had again flown and had demonstrated that\nthe result obtained in the first test was no mere accident Shortly after returning to Washington, Mr Langley left for Europe,\nbut before doing so he gave instructions to the workmen to remedy\nthe small weaknesses and defects which had been found in Aerodrome\nNo 6, and to have both aerodromes ready for trial before his return in\nthe fall PL 19 19 PATH OF AERODROME FLIGHTS, MAY 6 AND NOVEMBER 28, 1896,\nNEAR QUANTICO, VA , ON THE POTOMAC RIVER\n◊ lgr\nPL 20 20 INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF THE AERODROME AT THE\nMOMENT AFTER LAUNCHING IN ITS FLIGHT AT QUANTICO ON THE\nPOTOMAC RIVER, MAY 6, 1896 INSTANTANEOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF THE AERODROME AT THE\nMOMENT AFTER LAUNCHING IN ITS FLIGHT AT QUANTICO ON THE\nPOTOMAC RIVER, MAY 6, 1896 ENLARGED TEN TIMES ◊\nPL 21",

this time had as his\ninvited guest Mr Frank G Carpenter On November 27 a test was\nmade of Aerodrome No 6, the general disposition of which at this\ntime may be learned from the description in Chapter X ◊, and the\nphotographs in Plates 29A, 29B The model was launched at 4 25 p m with a steam pressure of 125 pounds The aerodrome went nearly\nhorizontally against the wind, and descended into the water in six and\na quarter seconds at a distance of perhaps 100 yards After the\nmachine had been recovered from the water, it was found that a pin\nhad broken in the synchronizing rod which connects the two propeller\nshafts together, and that the counter, which showed 495 revolutions\nof the propellers, had been caused to register [p109] inaccurately on\nthis account The balancing of Aerodrome No 6 had been made the\nsame as that of No 5, but in No 6 the line of thrust was twelve\ncentimetres higher, and this fact, which had not been taken into\naccount in determining the proper balancing for No 6, seemed to be\n\n\nsufficient cause for the aerodrome coming down into the water so\nsoon after being launched Darkness had descended before the\naerodrome could be recovered and prepared for a second trial On the\nnext day, November 28, a high wind prevailed in the morning, but in\nthe afternoon it became comparatively calm, and No 6 was launched\nat 4 20 p m under the same conditions as on the preceding day,\nexcept that the float, which weighed 275 grammes, was moved back\nfrom the bowsprit eighty centimetres in order to make the machine\nlighter in front The aerodrome was launched at a steam pressure of\nnot much over 100 pounds, the air draft for the burners being\ntemporarily bad The midrod made an angle of approximately three\ndegrees with the horizontal On account of a slight rain, which had\noccurred just before the machine was launched, the wings were wet\nand the weight of the entire aerodrome was doubtless as much as\ntwelve kilos Immediately on being launched the aerodrome started\ndirectly ahead in a gentle south wind, moving horizontally and slowly\nturning to the right and appearing to approach dangerously near to\nsome thick woods on the west shore However, it fortunately\ncontinued turning until it pointed directly up the beach with the wind\nin the rear It then moved more rapidly forward, dipped and rose but\nonce, and this very slightly, and continued its remarkable horizontal\nflight, varying not more than two yards out of a horizontal course,\nand this only for a moment, until it finally descended into the bay at a\npoint nearly in a line between the house-boat and the railroad station\nat Quantico Upon being recovered, it was found to be absolutely\nuninjured, and another flight would have been made with it\nimmediately but darkness had descended The time of flight, as\ndetermined independently by two stop-watches, was one minute and\nforty-five seconds The number of revolutions of the propellers was\n2801, or at the rate of 1600 R P M , which, with an allowance of\nfifty per cent slip, should have carried the aerodrome a distance of\n4600 feet in one and three-quarter minutes While the distance from\nthe house-boat in a straight line to the point at which the aerodrome\ndescended was only about 1600 feet, yet it was estimated by those\npresent that this straight-line distance was certainly not greater than\none-third the total length of the path traversed, which would mean a\ndistance of something like 4800 feet The length of the course, as\n\n\nplotted on the coast-survey map and afterwards measured, was 4200\nfeet, and it, therefore, seemed safe to say that the total distance\ntravelled was about three-quarters of a mile, and the speed was,\ntherefore, about thirty miles an hour ◊\n[p110]\nCHAPTER X\nDESCRIPTION OF THE LAUNCHING APPARATUS AND OF\nAERODROMES Nos 5 AND 6\nReference has already been made to the development of the “cast-\noff” apparatus that was used at Quantico for launching the\naerodrome An initial velocity is indispensable, and after long\nexperiment with other forms which proved failures, an apparatus was\ndesigned by me, which gave a sufficient linear velocity in any\ndirection It had, moreover, been found that, when the aerodrome was\nattached to any apparatus upon the roof of the house-boat, such slight\nchanges in the direction and intensity of the wind as would ordinarily\npass unperceived, would tend to distort or loosen it from its support,\nso that only the most rigid of fastenings at three independent bearing\npoints were of any use in holding it, while the wings must be\nseparately fastened down, lest they should be torn from their sockets It was, then, necessary to be able to fasten the aerodrome very firmly\nto the cast-off apparatus, to start it upon its journey in any direction\nwith an initial linear velocity that should equal its soaring speed, and\nto release it simultaneously at all points at the very same instant,\nwhile at the same time the points of contact of the launching device,\nto which it had just been fastened, were themselves drawn up out of\nthe way of the passing propellers and guys All these requirements and others were met by the apparatus finally\nadopted, which is shown in Plates 23 and 24 It consists of a strong\ntimber frame-work, carrying a track, consisting of two flat iron rails\nset on edge, upon which runs the launching car, suspended from two\nsmall wheels on each side At the front end of the frame there are two\ncylindrical air buffers to receive the buffing pistons and thus stop the\ncar after the aerodrome has been released The car is drawn to the\nrear end of the track and held by the bell-crank lever A (Plate 23) The contact points BB and C are turned down and the clutch-hook D\nset over the clutch-post K The aerodrome is thus held firmly up\nagainst the three points BB and C by the clutch D, and a distortion\nfrom its proper position rendered impossible All these points are\n\n\nthrown up out of the way of the projecting portions of the aerodrome\nat the instant of release This result is accomplished as follows: when\nthe car has reached the proper point in its forward course, the cam E,\nwhich is hinged at 1, is depressed by a roller fixed to the framework\nof the device In this motion it pushes down the adjustable\nconnections FF, which are attached at their lower ends to the bell-\ncrank arms GG, which turn about a central pivot at 2 Thus the\ndownward movement of the connections FF opens the jaws of the\n[p111] clutch D While the clutch D is rigidly attached to G to prevent\ntransverse movement, it is hinged to the latter at 3 so that it can fold\nin a longitudinal direction Screwed to the clutch D is a narrow plate\n4, which, when the clutch is closed, is behind the lug 5, thus\npreventing any turning about the hinge 3 But when the arms of G and the jaws of the clamp are thrown out\nby the depression of F, the plate 4 is moved out from behind the lug 5\nand the clamp is free to fold to the front The strut, hinged at 6, is\nunder a constant tension from the spring 7 to fold up, and is\nprevented from doing so only by the connections 8, by which it is held\ndown until the release of the plate 4 from behind the lug 5, when the\nspring snaps them instantly up and out of the way As the struts BB have no fixed connection with the aerodrome, they\nare released by the relaxation in the rigidity of the other connections\nand are thrown up by their spring 9 and held in that position by the\nclip 10 catching beneath the upper cross-piece The power for the propulsion of the car is obtained by means of\nfrom one to nine helical springs working under tension, and\nmultiplying their own motion four times by means of a movable two-\nsheave pulley, as shown in the drawing",

    "outside diameter extends to the top of the gasoline reservoir PL 25 SIDEVIEW OF STEEL FRAME OF AERODROME\nNO 5 SUSPENDED FROM LAUNCHING-CAR, OCTOBER\n24, 1896 ◊ lgr\nThis reservoir, shown at I, Plate 25, is also a light, hollow sphere\n120 mm in diameter; both this and the air chamber being made by\nsoldering \nhemispheres \n[p113] \nof \ncopper \ntogether \nat \ntheir\ncircumferences There are three openings in the reservoir tank; two at\nthe top and one at the bottom One of those at the top serves for the\nadmission of the 5-mm pipe bringing compressed air from the air\n\n\nchamber; the other is connected with a pipe 1 cm in diameter,\nthrough which gasoline is supplied to the tank, and which is closed by\na simple plug at the top The hole in the bottom serves as the outlet\nfor the gasoline to the burners Close to the bottom of the tank there is\nplaced a small needle valve, which serves to regulate the flow of oil,\nfor, were the pipe left open, the compressed air would force the oil\nout with such rapidity that the burners would be flooded and the\nintensity of the flame impaired The construction of this valve is\nclearly shown in Plate 26A It consists of a brass shell having one end\n(a) soldered to the bottom of the tank The needle enters through a\nstuffing box whose gland is held by two small screws The stem of the\nneedle is threaded and engages in a thread cut in the body of the\ncasting and is operated by a fine wire on the outside It will readily be\nseen that this device affords a means of making a very accurate\nadjustment of the flow of the liquid to the burners After leaving the needle valve the gasoline flows along the pipe S,\nPlate 25, until it reaches the evaporating coil, N In order to subject\nthe oil to as large a heating surface as possible, in comparison with\nthe sectional area through which it is flowing, the pipe, which left the\nneedle valve with a diameter of 6 mm soon contracted to 5 mm , is\nhere flattened to a width of 7 mm and a thickness of 2 mm There are\nseven complete turns of this flattened tubing coiled to an outside\ndiameter of 30 mm At the end of the seventh coil the pipe is enlarged\nto a diameter of 1 cm and two coils of this size are added, the inside\ndiameter being the same as that of the flattened coil This enlarged\nportion serves as a sort of expansion chamber for the complete\ngasification of the gasoline, which is then led back through a turn of\nthe enlarged pipe, beneath the coils and to the front At the front end\nof the coil a small branch is led off, forming a “bleeder,” which takes\nsufficient gas to supply the burner by which the coil is heated, the\nproducts of whose combustion pass into and between the coils of the\nboiler like those of the regular heating burners The gas pipe rises in\nfront of the coil and by a T connection branches to the two burners\nthat are placed in front of the coils of the boiler These burner pipes\nare 5 mm in diameter and enter sheet-iron hoods forming regular\nburners of the Bunsen type, which are fully shown in all their details\nin the accompanying engraving, Plate 26 The pipe is plugged at the\n\n\nend, and a hole 0 9 mm in diameter drilled for the nipple of the\nburner in front of the coil where the water first enters from the\nseparator, and 0 85 mm for the one in front of the return coil The\nface of the burner shell stands exactly central with and 41 mm in\nfront of the coils 35 [p114]\nThis constitutes the heat-generating portion of the machine, and\nwith it it is probable that a flame of as high a temperature is produced\nas can be reached, with the fuel used, by any practical device The boiler or steam-generating apparatus may be said to consist of\nthree parts: the separator, the circulating pumps, and the generating\ncoils The separator (M in Plate 25) is a device which has attained its\npresent form after a long course of development As at present\nconstructed, it is formed of a hollow sphere 190 mm in diameter and\nis located as nearly as possible over the center of gravity of the whole\napparatus It serves the double purpose of water reservoir and steam\ndrum, and is called a “separator” on account of the function which it\nperforms of separating the water from the steam as it enters from the\ncoils There is a straight vertical pipe 10 mm in diameter rising from\nthe top of the sphere and fastened to the right-hand side of the\nmidrod This is used for filling the separator with water Upon the\nother side of the midrod there is a small steam dome 42 mm in\ndiameter with a semi-spherical top rising to a height of 70 mm above\nthe top of the sphere From this dome two steam pipes are led off, one\nto the engine and the other to the steam gauge As already stated elsewhere, it was found in the experiments with\nthe coil boiler that an artificial forcing of the circulation of the water\nwas a necessity, as the natural circulation was too slow to be of any\nservice Accordingly, but only after numerous devices involving less\nweight had failed, a pump driven from the engine shaft was designed\nand used In the early experiments various types of pumps were tried\nin which the valves were opened and closed automatically by the\npressure of the water It was found, however, that with the mixture of\nsteam and water to be handled, the valves could not be depended\nupon to open and close properly at the high speeds at which is was\nnecessary to run the engine In Aerodrome No",
    "In Aerodrome No 5, therefore, a double-\nacting pump with a mechanically operated valve was used The pump,\n\n\nshown in detail in Plate 26A, is driven from a shaft connected with\nthe main engine shaft by a spur gear and pinion, which rotates at half\nthe speed of the engine shaft The pump itself consists of two barrels,\nthe main barrel having a diameter of 23 mm with a piston stroke of\n20 mm The outer shell of the barrel is made of aluminum bronze and\nis lined with a cast-iron bushing 1 25 mm in thickness The piston has\na length of 14 mm and is formed of an aluminum disc and center,\nhaving a follower plate of the same material with two cast-iron split\nrings sprung in The water is received into and delivered from the\nvalve cylinder, which is 18 mm in diameter and also lined with a\ncast-iron bushing 1 25 mm thick The aluminum bronze shells of both\ncylinders are 0 75 mm in thickness The valve is a simple piston valve\n35 mm long with bearing faces 4 mm long at each end The water is\ntaken from the bottom of the separator and led to the center of the\nvalve chest of the pump by a copper pipe 1 cm outside diameter The\nports [p115] leading from the valve to the main cylinder are 3 mm wide and 34 mm apart over their openings It will thus be seen that\nwhen the valve is in its central position, as it should be at the\nbeginning of the piston stroke, both ports are covered with a lap of\n0 5 mm inside and out, so that the valve has to move 0 5 mm",
    "5 mm before\nsuction or discharge can take place As the valve is moving most\nrapidly at this point, it opens and both functions begin before the\npiston has advanced perceptibly The delivery is made at the ends of\nthe valve cylinder through two copper pipes of 1 cm diameter that\nunite into a single pipe before reaching the boiler The throw of the\nvalve is 14 mm so that the ports are uncovered and held wide open\nfor the greater portion of the stroke of the piston, and begin to close\nonly when the latter approaches the end of its stroke In this way\nperfect freedom is given to the flow of the water and all choking is\navoided As the engine has been run at a speed of more than 688\nrevolutions per minute, the pump must have made at least 344 strokes\nin the same time, thus displacing 166 2 cc of water The diameter of\nthe piston rod and valve stem is 3 mm The diameter of\nthe piston rod and valve stem is 3 mm and they pass through stuffing\nboxes with glands of the ordinary type for packing This pump served\nits purpose admirably, and with it it was possible to maintain a\ncontinuous circulation of water through the two coils of the boiler The third element in the steam-generating system is the boiler\n\n\nproper36 (Plates 25 and 26A), which consists of two coils of copper\npipe, having an outside diameter of 10 mm , each coil being formed of\n21 turns each 75 mm in diameter upon the outside and spaced 7 5\nmm apart, so that the total axial length of each coil is 36 cm The water is delivered to the front end of the right-hand coil, and,\nfirst passing through this, crosses over at the rear of the boiler to the\nleft-hand coil, returning through it to the front whence it is led to and\ndelivered into the top of the separator Here the steam and water are\nseparated, the former going through the separator and thence to the\nengine, while the unevaporated water falls to the bottom to be again\ntaken into the pumps and sent through the coils In order that the draft of the burner and the gases of combustion\nmight not be dissipated, it was necessary to sheathe the boiler The\nmethod of doing this is shown in Plate 25 It will be seen that the\nfront half of the boiler is wrapped in a sheet of mica through which\nthe coils can be faintly seen This, in turn, is held at the extreme front\nend by a strip of thin sheet-iron, O Over the back end the stack Q,\nmade of very thin sheet-iron, is slipped This has an oblong cross-\nsection at the lower end where it goes over the boiler; it is provided\nwith a hole through which the midrod passes, and terminates in a\ncircular opening of about 10 cm diameter [p116]\nThe engine, which is clearly shown in the dimensional drawing,\nPlate 26B, is of the plain slide-valve type, using a piston valve and\nsolid piston, without packing rings The cylinder is formed of a piece\nof steel tubing 35 mm outside diameter, with flanges 47 mm in\ndiameter and 2 25 mm thick brazed to each end, to which the\ncylinder heads are attached by small machine screws Inside this\ncylinder is a thin cast-iron bushing in order to obtain a better rubbing\nsurface for the piston The cross-head is a small piece of aluminum\nbronze, running on round guides that also serve as cylinder braces There are also four hollow braces, 5 mm in diameter, running from\nthe back cylinder head to a corrugated steel bed-plate, that stands\nvertically and reaches from one side rod of the frame of the hull to the\nother, and to which are bolted the bearings of the main shaft The\nconnecting rod has the cross-section of a four-rayed star and drives a\ncrank in the center of the shaft The following are some of the\nprincipal dimensions of the engine:\n\n\nmillimetres Inside diameter of cylinder\n 33  \nStroke of piston\n 70  \nLength of cylinder inside\n 88  \nLength of piston\n 11  \nClearance at each end\n  0 5\nDiameter of piston rod\n  5  \nLength of cross-head\n 17 5\nDiameter of guides\n  4 5\nDistance from center to center of guides\n 26  \nLength of guides\n110  \nLength of wrist-pin bearing\n  8 5\nLength of connecting rod\n150  \nRatio of connecting rod to stroke\n2 1/7 to 1\nLength of crank pin\n 10  \nDiameter of main shaft\n  8  \nLength of main bearings\n 25  \nDistance from center of cylinder to center of valve stem\n 35  \nLength of valve\n 72  \nWidth of ports\n  2  \nOutside lap of valve\n  4  \nInside lap of valve\n  3  \nLead of valve\n  0  \nTravel of valve\n 13  \nCut-off from beginning of stroke\n 57  \nExhaust opens\nEnd of stroke\nExhaust closes on return stroke\n 48  \nDiameter of valve stem\n  4 5\nDiameter of eccentric\n 36  \nWidth of eccentric\n  4  \nWidth of crank arm\n  4  \nThe weights were nearly as follows:\ngrammes Engine\n464\nPump and pump shafts\n231\nGasoline tank and valves\n178\nBurners\n360\nBoilers, frames holding boilers, and mica covers over boilers\n651\nSeparator, steam gauge and pipe for engine\n540\nExhaust pipe\n143\nSmoke stack\n342\nIn all, 2909 grammes, or 6 4 pounds PL 26A DIMENSIONED DRAWING OF BOILER COILS, BURNERS, PUMP,\nNEEDLE VALVE AND THRUST BEARING ◊ lgr\nPL 26B DIMENSIONED DRAWING OF ENGINE NO 5 ◊ lgr\n\n\nPL 27A SIDE AND END ELEVATIONS OF AERODROME NO 5, MAY 11,\n1896 ◊\nPL",

it is hollow, being 8 mm outside\ndiameter, with a hole 5 mm diameter through the center It is formed of five sections: the middle section, containing the\ncrank, has a length of 110 mm and is connected at either end, by\nflanged couplings, to lengths 320 mm long, which are in turn\nextended by the end sections having a length of 230 mm In addition\nto the four main bearings that are bolted to the pressed-steel bed-plate\nalready mentioned, there are two bearings on the outer framework on\neach side At the outer end of each shaft there is keyed thereto a bevel\ngear with an outside diameter of 27 mm and having 28 teeth This\ngear meshes with one of 35 teeth upon a shaft at right angles to the\n\n\nmain shaft and parallel to the axis of the aerodrome These two shafts,\none on either arm, serve to carry and transmit the power to the\npropellers They are 192 mm long, 8 mm in diameter, and are\nprovided with three bearings that are brazed to a corrugated steel\nplate forming the end of the outrigger portion of the frame These\nshafts are also hollow, having an axial hole 4 mm in diameter drilled\nthrough them The propeller seat has a length of 43 mm and the\npropeller is held in position by a collar 25 mm in diameter at the\nfront end, from which there project two dowel-pins that fit into\ncorresponding holes in the hubs of the propellers, which are held up\nagainst the collar by a smaller one screwed into the back end of the\nshaft The thrust of the collar is taken up by a pin screwed into the\nend of the forward box and acting as a step against which the shaft\nbears, the arrangement being clearly shown by the accompanying\ndrawing, Plate 26A [p118]\nThis, then, comprises the motive power equipment of the\naerodrome, and, to recapitulate, it includes the storage, automatic\nfeeding and regulation of the fuel; the storage, circulation and\nevaporation of the water; the engine to convert the expansive power\nof the steam into mechanical work; and the shafting for the\ntransmission of the energy developed by the engine to the propellers The propellers were made with the greatest care Those used in the\nsuccessful trials were 1 metre in diameter, with an actual axial pitch\nof 1 25 metres They were made of white pine, glued together in strips\n7 mm thick The hub had a length of 45 mm and a thickness or\ndiameter of 25 mm At the outer edge the blade had a width of 315\nmm and a thickness of 2 mm These propellers were most accurately\nbalanced and tested in every particular; each propeller blade was\nbalanced in weight with its mate and the pitch measured at every\npoint along the radius to insure its constancy; finally the two\npropellers of the pair to be used together were balanced with each\nother so that there would be no disturbance in the equilibrium of the\nmachine As will be noted from the foregoing description of the\nmachinery, the propellers ran in opposite directions, as they were\nmade right- and left-hand screws The weight of each propeller was\n362 grammes We now turn again to take up the details of the construction of the\n\n\nframework by which this propelling machinery is carried The whole\naerodrome, as clearly shown in the photographs, Plates 27A and 27B,\nis built about and dependent from one main backbone or midrod,\nwhich extends well forward of all of the machinery and aft beyond all\nother parts This rod, as well as all other portions of the framework, is\nof steel tubing The midrod, being largest, is 20 mm outside diameter,\nwith a thickness of 0 5 mm",
    "5 mm It is to this midrod that the wings are\ndirectly attached, and from it the hull containing the machinery is\nsuspended The plan outline of the hull skeleton is similar to that of the deck of\na vessel The steel tubing, 0 5 mm thick, of which it is formed, has an\noutside diameter of 15 mm from the front end to the cross-framing\nused to carry the propellers, back of which the diameter is decreased\nto 10 mm The midrod makes a slight angle with this frame, the vertical\ndistance between the centers of the tubing being 73 mm at the front\nand 67 mm at the back The tube, corresponding to the keel of a\nvessel, is braced to the upper tubes by light U-shaped ribs and by two\n8-mm tubes forming a V brace on a line with the back end of the\nguides of the engine At the extreme front and back there is a direct\nvertical connection to the midrod The propeller shafts are 1 23 m 23 m from center to center, and are\ncarried on a special cross-framing, partaking, as already stated, of the\ncharacter of an outrigger on a row-boat (See Plate 27B ) The rear\nrods, which are of 10 mm steel tubing, start from the front end of the\nrear bearings of the propeller shaft and [p119] extend across from side\nto side The top rod is brazed to the side pieces of the hull and the\nbottom rod to the keel They are connected by a vertical strut of 8-\nmm tubing at a distance of 265 mm inside of each propeller shaft At\nthe front end of the propeller shaft two more rods run across the\nframe The lower is similar and parallel to the back rod already\ndescribed, while the upper is bowed to the front, as shown in the plan\nview of the frame (Plate 30) In order to take the forward thrust of the\npropeller a second cross-brace is inserted, which runs from the rear\nbearing of the propeller shaft to a point just in advance of the front\nhead of the cylinder, and is brazed to the two upper tubes of the\ncross-frame as well as to the upper tubes of the main framing of the\n\n\nhull The outer ends of the tubes of the cross-framing are brazed to a\nthin, stamped steel plate which firmly binds them together, while at\nthe same time it forms a base for attaching the bearings of the\npropeller shaft This end plate has a thickness of one millimetre In addition to the framing proper there are two guy-posts which fit\ninto the sockets CC, and over which truss wires are drawn, as shown\nin the side view in Plate 27A These posts have a length of 730 mm from the lower edge of the socket, and are capped at their lower\nextremity by a light steel ferrule whose outside diameter is 10 mm From the drawing of the wings of No 5, shown in Plate 17, it will\nbe seen that they are formed of two pine rods 15 mm in diameter at\nthe inner ends, tapering to a half circle of the same diameter at the\ntips These rods are connected by eleven spruce ribs measuring 8\nmm × 3 mm , and curved, as shown in the side elevation, these, in\nturn, being covered by a light white silk drawn so tightly as to present\na smooth, even surface The total length of the wing is 2 metres, and\nthe width over all is 805 mm Vertical stiffness is obtained in the\nwings by a series of guy-wires, which pass over light struts resting\nupon the main rods These main rods are inserted and held in the\nwing clamps A and B, Fig 16, and make an angle of 150° with each\nother As is the case with all other essential details of the aerodrome,\na great deal of time and attention was given to the designing of the\nwing clamps before a satisfactory arrangement was secured To enable it to control the aerodrome in both directions, the tail-\nrudder, Plate 27A, has both a horizontal and a vertical surface, the\napproximate dimensions of which are, length 115 cm (3 8 feet),\nmaximum width 64 cm (2 1 feet), giving each quarter section an area\nof about 0 64 sq m (6 9 sq ft )",
    ") It is given the proper angle and\ndegree of elasticity in a vertical direction by the flat hickory spring,\nwhich fits into the clamp N, and attaches the rudder to the frame The only other attachments of the aerodrome are the reel, float, and\ncounter They have nothing whatever to do with the flying of the\nmachine, and are [p120] merely safety appliances to insure its recovery\nfrom the water The reel consists of a light spool on which a fine cord\nis wound, one end of which is attached to a light float that detaches\nitself and lies upon the surface of the water when the machine sinks,\nwhile the other end is fastened to the spool that goes down with the\n\n\naerodrome The “float” is a light copper vessel with conical ends\nwhich is firmly fastened to the midrod, and which is intended to so\nlower the specific gravity of the whole machine that it will not sink The cylindrical portion of this float has a length of 250 mm and a\ndiameter of 170 mm , one cone having a length of 65 mm and the\nother and front one a length of 140 mm , which makes the total\nlength of the float 375 mm It is made of very thin copper, and served\nin the successful trials not only as a float to sustain the machine on\nthe surface of the water, but also as a weight by which the center of\ngravity was so adjusted that flight was possible The counter records the number of revolutions of the propellers\nafter launching It is a small dial counter, reading to 10,000, with a\nspecial attachment which prevents any record being made of the\nrevolutions of the propellers, until the actual moment of launching,\nwhen a piece on the launching apparatus throws the counter in gear\nat the instant that the aerodrome leaps into the air DESCRIPTION\nOF\nAERODROME\nNO 6\nAerodrome No 6, it will be remembered, was the outgrowth of a\nnumber of changes made in No 4 during the fall of 1895 and the\nearly part of 1896 In this reconstruction the aim was to lighten the\nwhole machine on account of the smaller engines in either No 4 or\nNo 5 The modifications from No 4 were so radical and the\ndifferences that exist between Nos 5 and 6 are so considerable as to\ndemand careful attention As regards general appearance the frame of Aerodrome No 6\nresembles that of No 5 in consisting of a single continuous midrod of\nsteel tubing, 20 mm in diameter, 0 5 mm thick, immediately beneath\nwhich the hull containing the machinery is situated In reconstructing\nthe framework after the tests in January, 1896, had shown it to be\ndangerously weak, especially against torsion, it was decided to make\nthe hull only strong enough to carry its contents and to attach it to the\nstronger midrod in such a way that all torsional strains would be\ntaken up by it, whereas in No 5 the hull structure must bear a large\n\n\nproportion of such strains It was therefore built throughout of 8-mm tubing, 0 3 mm thick, and was rigidly attached to the midrod by\nbraces at the front and rear, and also at the cross-frame The hull was\nalso made narrower (except at the rear, where it was widened to\ncontain the boiler) and shorter than the hull of No 5—an\nadvantageous change made possible by the fact that the engines were\nnot contained in the hull, but mounted on the transverse frame PL 28 STEEL FRAME OF AERODROME NO 6, ON\nLAUNCHING CAR ◊ lgr\n[p121]\nIn No 5, as described above, a single engine mounted at the front\nend of the hull communicated its power through transmission shafts\nand gearing to the propellers, which were necessarily in the same\nplane This brought the line of thrust very nearly in the same plane as\nthe center of gravity of the aerodrome, a condition tending to promote\ninstability of longitudinal equilibrium",
    "This brought the line of thrust very nearly in the same plane as\nthe center of gravity of the aerodrome, a condition tending to promote\ninstability of longitudinal equilibrium In No In No 6, however, the use of\ntwo engines situated on the transverse frame and communicating their\npower directly to the propellers, made it possible to raise the\ntransverse frame 12 cm above the hull, and thus raise the line of\nthrust to a position intermediate between the center of pressure and\nthe center of gravity, without materially affecting the latter As a\nresult of this change Aerodrome No 6 was rendered much more stable\nand made steadier flights with fewer undulations than No 5 The engines in use on No 6 were the small engines described above\nin connection with No 4 The cylinders were of steel tubing 2 8 cm in\ndiameter, with a 5-cm stroke, each cylinder thus having a capacity of\n30 8 cc They were lined with a thin cast-iron bushing and cast-iron\nrings were sprung in the piston head so as to give as smooth a rubbing\nsurface and as perfect action as possible As in the engine of No 5 a\nplain sliding valve of the piston type was used, cut-off being\napproximately at one-half, though the ports were so small that it was\ndifficult to determine it with any great accuracy No packing was\nused, but the parts were carefully ground so as to give a perfect fit These engines, as is most clearly shown in Plate 30, were mounted\nsymmetrically on either side of the cross-frame and were connected\ndirectly to the propeller shafts In order to insure that the propellers\n\n\nwould run at the same rate, there was provided a synchronizing shaft,\nT, in Plate 30, having on each end a bevel gear, which intermeshed\nwith similar gears on the propeller shafts Steam for the cylinders was\nconveyed from the separator through the pipes LL The steam-generating apparatus for No 6 was exactly like that\nalready described in connection with No 5, the only difference being\nin the more compact arrangement in the case of No 6 The relative\nlocation of the apparatus in the two models is clearly shown in Plates\n28, 29B, and 30, the corresponding parts being similarly labeled, so\nthat a separate description for No 6 is superfluous The wings used on No 6 were somewhat smaller than those of No 5, and differed from them in having the front mainrib bent to a\nquadrant at its outer extremity and continued as the outer rib of the\nwing The degree of curvature of the wings was also somewhat less,\nbeing one-eighteenth for No 6 and one-twelfth for No 5 The four\nwings were of the same size and had a total area of 54 sq ft On\naccount of the shortened hull of No 6 they were allowed a much\ngreater range of adjustment, which rendered it much easier to bring\nthe CP into the proper relative position to the CG than was the ease\nwith No 5 [p122]\nThe Pénaud rudder for No 6 was similar to that for No 5, the two\nin fact being interchangeable, and was similarly attached to the\nframe The reel, float, counter, and all other accessories were identical\nfor the two machines To sum up the comparative features of these two successful steam-\ndriven models: Aerodrome No 6 was both lighter and frailer than No 5, and required much more delicate adjustment, but when the correct\nadjustments had been made its flying qualities were superior, as\nregards both speed and stability PL 29A",

    "I am led to present it not\nonly by the request with which he honors me, but by the apprehension that\nmy administrative duties may put a stop to these researches, so that it\nseems to me advisable to announce the degree in which I have already\nsucceeded, although this success be not as complete as I should like to make\nit The experiments took place on a bay of the Potomac River, some distance\nbelow Washington The aerodrome was built chiefly of steel, though lighter\nmaterial entered into the construction, so that its density as a whole was a\nlittle below unity No gas whatever entered into the construction of the\nmachine, and the absolute weight, independent of fuel and water, was\nabout 11 kilos (24 pounds) The width of the supporting surfaces was about\n4 metres (13 feet), and the power was furnished by an extremely light\nengine of approximately one horse-power There was no one to direct it on\nboard, and the means for keeping it automatically in horizontal flight were\nnot complete It is important to remark that the small dimensions of the\nmachine did not allow it to include any apparatus for condensing the steam,\nso that it could only carry water enough for a very brief course—a\ndrawback which would not be encountered in one of a larger construction It is important to remark that the small dimensions of the\nmachine did not allow it to include any apparatus for condensing the steam,\nso that it could only carry water enough for a very brief course—a\ndrawback which would not be encountered in one of a larger construction It is also to be noted that the speed estimated by Mr Bell was that\nobtained in a continuous ascending flight, and much less than would have\nbeen attained in a horizontal course On Mechanical Flight Letter of Mr Alexander Graham Bell to Mr Langley Washington, May 6, 1896 I am quite aware that you are not desirous of publication until you have\nattained more complete success in obtaining horizontal flight under an\nautomatic direction, but it seems that what I have been privileged to see to-\nday marks such a great progress on everything ever before done in this\nway, that the news of it should be made public, and I am happy to give my\nown testimony on the results of two trials which I have witnessed to-day by\nyour invitation, hoping that you will kindly consent to making it known For the first trial, the apparatus, chiefly constructed of steel and driven\nby a steam engine, was launched from a boat at a height of about 20 feet\nfrom the water Under the impulse of its engines alone, it advanced against\nthe wind and while drifting little, and slowly ascending with a remarkably\nuniform motion, it described curves of about 100 metres in diameter; till at\na height in the air which I estimate at about 25 metres (82 feet), the\nrevolutions of the screws ceased for want of steam, as I understood, and the\napparatus descended gently and sank into the water, which it reached in a\nminute and a half from the start It was not damaged, and was immediately\nready for another flight In the second trial it repeated in nearly every respect the action of the\nfirst, and with an identical result It rose smoothly in great curves until it\napproached a prominent wooded promontory, which it crossed at a height\nof 8 to 10 metres above the tops of the highest trees, upon the exhaustion\nof the steam descending slowly into the bay, where it settled in a minute\nand thirty-one seconds from the start You have an instantaneous\nphotograph of it, which I took just after the launch [See plates 20, 21, and\n22 of present work ]\nFrom the extent of the curves which it described, which I estimated with\nother persons, from measurements which I took, and from the number of\nrevolutions of the propellers, as recorded by the automatic counter which I\nconsulted, I estimate the absolute length of each course to be over half an\nEnglish mile, or, more exactly a little over 900 metres (2953 feet) The duration of flight during the second trial was one minute and thirty-\none seconds, and the average velocity between twenty and twenty-five\nmiles an hour, or, let us say 10 metres a second, in a course which was\nconstantly ascending I was extremely impressed by the easy regular course\n\n\nof each trial, and by the fact that the apparatus descended each time with\nsuch smoothness and gentleness as to render any jar or danger out of the\nquestion It seemed to me that no one could have witnessed these experiments\nwithout being convinced that the possibility of mechanical flight had been\ndemonstrated [8]\nIt is desirable that the reader should be acquainted with the contents of this\ntreatise, and of another by me, entitled “The Internal Work of the Wind,”\nboth published by the Smithsonian Institution A knowledge of these works\nis not absolutely necessary, but of advantage in connection with what\nfollows [9]\n“Experiments in Aerodynamics,” p 107 [10]\nChapter VIII ◊",

but no one who has read the\nrecord of his astronomical expedition to Mt Whitney, or the story of\nhis development of the Bolometer, or the preceding chapters of this\n\n\nhistory of his years of patient work in the development of the flying\nmachine, can have failed to obtain some appreciation of this most\nstriking feature of his character Having once determined on the\naccomplishment of a definite object, no amount of difficulty that\nmight arise deterred him from pushing on until in some way and by\nsome means he had succeeded; and no one appreciated better than he\nthat if the thin edge of the right wedge can be inserted under an\nobstacle, that obstacle can be removed, no matter how formidable it\nmay seem The undertaking of the construction of a large aerodrome was very\nlargely influenced by President McKinley, who had become impressed\nwith the great [p124] possibilities of a flying machine as an engine of\nwar When he found that Mr Langley was willing to devote his own\ntime to the development of a machine, provided the Government\nwould furnish the funds for the actual construction and tests of it, he\nappointed a joint board, consisting of Army and Navy officers, to\ninvestigate and report on the plans with which Mr Langley had\nachieved success with the models The report of this joint board of\nArmy and Navy officers being favorable, the Board of Ordnance and\nFortification of the War Department, at the direction of President\nMcKinley, requested Mr Langley to undertake the construction and\ntest of a machine, which, while not expected to be a practical war\nmachine, might finally lead to the development of such an engine of\nwar In this connection it is interesting to read a letter which Mr Langley addressed to the Board of Ordnance and Fortification at the\ntime he undertook this work SMITHSONIAN\nINSTITUTION\n, December 12, 1898 The Board of Ordnance and Fortification, War Department GENTLEMEN\n: In response to your invitation, I repeat what I had the honor to say to the\nBoard—that I am willing, with the consent of the Regents of this Institution,\nto undertake for the Government the further investigation of the subject of\nthe construction of a flying machine on a scale capable of carrying a man,\nthe investigation to include the construction, development and test of such\na machine under conditions left as far as practicable in my discretion, it\nbeing understood that my services are given to the Government in such\ntime as may not be occupied by the business of the Institution, and without\n\n\ncharge I have reason to believe that the cost of the construction will come within\nthe sum of $50,000 00, and that not more than one-half of that will be\ncalled for in the coming year I entirely agree with what I understand to be the wish of the Board that\nprivacy be observed with regard to the work, and only when it reaches a\nsuccessful completion shall I wish to make public the fact of its success I attach to this a memorandum of my understanding of some points of\ndetail in order to be sure that it is also the understanding of the Board, and\nI am, gentlemen,\nWith much respect,\nYour obedient servant,      \nS P LANGLEY MEMORANDUM\nATTACHED TO MY LETTER OF THIS DATE TO THE BOARD OF ORDNANCE AND\nFORTIFICATION\nWhile stating that I have, so far as I know, an exclusive right of property\nin the results of the experiments in aerodromics which I have conducted\nheretofore and am now conducting, and while understanding that this\nproperty and all rights connected with it, whether patentable or otherwise,\nwill remain mine unqualifiedly, I am glad to place these results, without\ncharge, at the service of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification for the\nspecial construction at present proposed, which seems to me to be of\nNational utility [p125]\nI assume that no public statement will be made by the permission of the\nBoard until the work is terminated, but that I may publish ultimately at my\ndiscretion a statement of any scientific work done in this connection I understand that the exercise of this discretion includes the ordering and\npurchase of all material by contract or in open market, and the employment\nof any necessary help, without restriction, and that, while I desire that no\nmoney shall pass through my hands, itemized bills for each expenditure,\nmade in proper form and approved by me, will be paid by the Chief Signal\nOfficer Much has already been spent at the Smithsonian Institution for the\npurpose in question, in special apparatus, tools and experiments, and in\nrecent constructions now actually going on, which have involved still more\ntime than money, and which are essential for experimental use in building\nthe proposed machine;

    "After a\nmost extended search for the best builder to undertake this work, a\ncontract was entered into on December 12, 1898, with Mr S M Balzer, an engine builder in New York City He was to furnish a\ntwelve-horse-power engine to weigh not more then 100 pounds, and\ndelivery of it was to be made on or before February 28, 1899 With\nthis great problem of the engine apparently provided for, every\nfacility of the Institution shops was pressed to the utmost limit in\norder to have the frame, supporting surfaces, launching apparatus,\nand other accessories ready as soon as possible after the delivery of\nthe engine It was expected from the first that more power would be\nnecessary than this one engine would furnish, and provision had been\nmade in the contract that a duplicate engine should be constructed\nimmediately after the completion of this first one From past\nexperience, however, it was not likely that the correct balancing of\nthe aerodrome could be determined from a priori calculation based on\nthe results obtained with the models, and it was, therefore, expected\nthat the aerodrome would have to be launched several times before a\nsuccessful flight could be obtained In view of this it was planned to\nmake a test of the machine as soon as the first engine was ready, with\nthe expectation that, while the aerodrome would not have sufficient\npower to fly, yet the test would furnish definite data on the all-\nimportant question of balancing, and also determine whether or not\nthe launching apparatus would require modification In fact, Mr Langley felt so apprehensive that the first, and possibly the second\ntest, would be unsuccessful that, in order to avoid the possibility of a\nfatal accident, it was planned that a dummy should be used to\nrepresent the weight of the man in these preliminary tests This plan, however, was not carried out In 1903, when the large\naerodrome was finally completed, so much time had been lost that the\nwriter proposed to assume the risks of such an accident and to guide\n\n\nthe machine in its first test, in the hope of avoiding a disaster, with\nthe consequent delay of months for repairs, which the presence of a\ncontrolling hand capable of correcting any inaccuracies of balancing\nrendered far less likely to occur To this proposal Mr Langley assented\nwith great reluctance, as he fully realized the danger involved [p127]\nParticular attention is called to the above facts, which clearly show\nthat while a certain degree of success in the initial tests was later\nhoped for, yet from the beginning it had been felt rather certain that\nseveral tests would have to be made before final success would be\nachieved To those experienced in scientific experiments this realization of the\nprobability of several tests being necessary before success could\nreasonably be expected does not seem strange, for the record of past\nexperience contains very few examples of epoch-making inventions\nspringing full fledged from the hand of their maker and proving a\nsuccess on the first test The two experiments made in the fall of 1903, in which the\naerodrome was each time so damaged in the process of launching that\nits ability to fly was never really tested, should therefore be\nconsidered merely as the first of a series which it had been expected\nwould need to be made before success would be achieved Further\ntests were made impossible at the time on account of the lack of\nfunds, the expense of such work being unusually heavy While the lack of funds, therefore, was the real cause of the\ntemporary suspension of the work, yet an influence which does not\noften enter into scientific work—the unjust criticism of a hostile press\n—was directly responsible for the lack of funds It seems very certain\nthat had it not been for this criticism of the press the funds would\nhave been readily forthcoming for continuing the work to the point of\nsuccess",

II\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn the development of man-carrying flying machines two well-\ndefined paths are open First: Starting with gliding machines, in which\ngravity furnishes the motive power, the operator may by practice\nacquire sufficient skill in controlling them to warrant the addition of\npropelling mechanism, and individual skill in control may be\ngradually replaced by automatic controlling mechanism Second:\nFrom \nself-propelled \nmodels, \npossessing \nautomatic-equilibrium\ncontrolling mechanism, and of a sufficient size to furnish\ndeterminative data, one may, by proper modification in size and\nconstruction, progress to an automatically controlled man-carrying\nmachine in which, for ideal conditions, no especial skill on the part of\nthe operator is required Each method has its advantages After concluding his earlier and purely physical researches, the\nresults of which were embodied in “Experiments in Aerodynamics,”\nMr Langley was so firmly convinced of the practicability of\nmechanical flight that he undertook the construction of the model\naerodromes in order to demonstrate it It is very doubtful if at any\ntime, prior to the successful flights of the models in 1896, he seriously\ncontemplated the construction of man-carrying machines His object\nin developing the models was not, therefore, to furnish a prototype for\na large machine, but merely to demonstrate the feasibility of\nmechanical flight; and this he did This is shown very clearly by the\nclosing remark of the article he published in 1897, describing the\nflights of the models “I have now brought to a close the portion of the\nwork which seemed to be specially mine—the demonstration of the\npracticability of mechanical flight-—and for the next stage, which is\nthe commercial and practical development of the idea, it is probable\nthat the world may look to others ”37 When he later undertook the\nconstruction of the large machine for the War Department it was\nnatural that, with the inspiring sight of the models in flight still fresh\nin his mind, he determined to use as a prototype these successful\nmachines, which were the only things of human construction that had\n\n\never really flown for any considerable distance Not being an engineer, and realizing that to pass from the\nconstruction of models to that of man-carrying machines involved the\nsolution of many engineering problems, Mr Langley, in the spring of\n1898, sought the advice of Dr R H Thurston, who had from the first\nmanifested the deepest interest in his [p129] work in aerodromics On\nthe recommendation of Dr Thurston he engaged the services of the\nwriter, who assumed charge of the work in June, 1898 While the method of “cut and try” had brought success in the\nmodels, and was perhaps the only method by which they could have\nbeen successfully developed, it was thought that, with these models as\na basis of design, much time would be saved by making an analytical\nstudy of them as engineering structures, and from the data thus\nobtained the proper proportions for the parts of the larger machine\ncould be calculated Such an analytical study, however, revealed very little from which\nto make calculations as to the strength necessary for the various parts\nof the large machine, but it did show very clearly that most of the\nparts were working under stresses generally far above the elastic limit\nof the materials, and in many cases the ultimate breaking strength\nwas closely approached Such a condition was the natural outcome of\nthe method by which these models had been developed—all the\nvarious parts having been built at first of the least possible weight\nand, when they proved too weak, strengthened until they would\nwithstand the stresses imposed on them It is extremely doubtful if\nprevious calculations as to the strength necessary would have been of\nany assistance, in fact it is probable that it would have been a distinct\ndisadvantage and would have resulted in the machines being entirely\ntoo heavy for flight The exact strength which had been incorporated in the frames of\nthe models was as unknown as was the exact amount of the stresses\nwhich they has been made to withstand Their static strength was\neasily determined by calculation, but the stresses due to the live loads\nwere incapable of exact determination from the available data, for\nstresses produce strains, which in turn generally cause distortions\naccompanied by greatly increased stresses While exact data were,\ntherefore, lacking as to stresses and strengths in many of the\n\n\nimportant parts, yet the models furnished most important illustrations\nof unusual strength for minimum weight, and a careful study of them\nshowed many ways in which increased strength could be obtained\nwith decreased weight which could hardly have been devised without\nthese concrete examples It was, however, by no means possible to build the large aerodrome\nwithin the permissible limits of weight by simply increasing the\nvarious parts of the models according to some predetermined function\nof the size of the whole The fundamental difficulty is that inevitably, by the laws of\ngeometry, which are mere expressions of the properties of space, if a\nsolid of any form is magnified, the weight increases as the cube, while\nthe surface increases only as the square, of the linear dimensions Successive generations of physicists and mathematicians pointed out\nthat while this “law of the cube” is of advantage in the construction of\nballoons, yet it is a stumbling block that will prevent man [p130] from\never building a dynamic flying machine sufficiently large to carry\neven one human being 38\nHowever, since strength is a function of material and form rather\nthan weight, it is possible by selecting proper materials and adopting\nsuitable structural forms to evade to a certain extent this “law of the\ncube ” The whole history of structural science has therefore been a\nseries of attempts to find stronger and lighter material and to discover\nmethods of so modifying form as to dispense with all parts of a\nstructure that do not contribute to its strength So in aerodromics the\nstructural problem has been that of finding materials and forms best\nsuited to the purpose for which they are required, for it does not\nalways follow that either the form or the material best suited for one\nscale of construction is the most advantageous to employ on a\ndifferent scale Nor is even the form or material which gives the\ngreatest strength for the least weight necessarily the best to employ For the structural problem must necessarily be co-ordinated with\nthose of balancing, propelling, and transporting, and each must,\ntherefore, have its proper attention in the design of the whole\nmachine Many of the general considerations of the design of an aerodrome\nsufficiently large to transport a man were determined during the\n\n\nspring and summer of 1898, when the first actual drawings (Plate 32,\nFigs 1, 2 and 3) of the proposed machine were made Starting with\nthe assumption that the Models Nos 5 and 6 were capable of\ntransporting a load of approximately ten pounds more than their\nweight, it was seen that, since the supporting surface of any\naerodrome would increase approximately as the square of the linear\ndimensions, in order to carry a man the aerodrome would need to be\napproximately four times the linear dimensions of these models Calculations based on the results accomplished in the construction of\nthe models indicated that such an aerodrome would need to be\nequipped with engines developing 24 horse-power The best that\ncould reasonably be hoped for was that these engines would not\nweigh over 200 pounds, and, therefore, allowing 40 pounds for fuel\nand fuel tanks, it became necessary to bring the weight of frame,\nsupporting surfaces, tail, rudder, propellers and every other accessory\nwithin 250 pounds, if the total weight of the machine, including 150\npounds for the aeronaut, was not to exceed 640 pounds, or 16 times\nthe combined weight of the model and its load of 10 pounds Although the problem of constructing the frame, wings and all other\nparts within the limit of 250 pounds seemed indeed formidable, it was\nbelieved that the greatest obstacle in the production of such a\nmachine would be that of securing a sufficiently light and powerful\nengine to propel it",

been given of the attempts made by Mr Langley to secure a suitable gasoline engine for the large aerodrome,\nbut the difficulties encountered in the search have not perhaps been\nsufficiently emphasized At this time (1898) the automobile industry,\nthrough which has come the development of the gasoline engine, was\nin its infancy, and there were few builders either in the United States\nor Europe who were attempting anything but rough and heavy\nconstruction Many of them were enthusiastic over the possibilities of\nthe internal combustion engine, and were ready to talk of devising\nsuch an engine as the aerodrome would require, but few were willing\n\n\nto guarantee any such definite results as were demanded However,\nthe prospects of securing a suitable gasoline engine from a reliable\nbuilder within a reasonable time seemed so strong that it was decided\nearly in 1898 to begin the construction of the frame on the general\nplan which would probably be best adapted for use with a gasoline\nengine, and in case it finally proved impossible to secure such an\nengine, to construct later a steam plant which could be adapted to this\nparticular frame Some tentative work on the construction of the frame was\naccordingly begun in the summer of 1898, some months before an\nengine builder was found who seemed likely to be successful in\nfurnishing the engines An extensive series of tests on propellers was\nalso made at this time for the immediate purpose of determining what\nform and size would be best, since the dimensions of the transverse\nframe could not be definitely settled until it was known how large the\npropellers would need to be Preliminary designs were also begun for the wings, rudders, and\nlaunching apparatus, but when the point was reached of actually\nmaking the working drawings for these, it was seen that the change in\nthe scale of the work required many important modifications in\nconstructional details As the models had flown successfully only three\ntimes, and in each case under practically the same conditions, it was\nfelt that it would be unwise to make changes in important details\nwithout first making a series of tests of the models in flight to\ndetermine the effect of such changes It was therefore decided to\ncompletely overhaul Models Nos 5 and 6, strengthening them in\nmany important parts and “tuning up” their power plants, which had\nslightly deteriorated since they were last used in November, 1896 When the work of preparing these models for further experiments was\nbegun it was thought that it would require at most only a few weeks,\nbut as it progressed it was found that certain parts of the mechanical\nwork on the engines had been so poorly executed originally that it\nwould be necessary to practically rebuild the engines The final result\nwas that the power plants of both aerodromes were entirely rebuilt,\nand they were not ready for actual test in flight until the spring of\n1899 [p132]\nMuch of the preliminary work necessary for the determination of\n\n\nactual working plans was therefore completed in the summer and fall\nof 1898, and when on December 12 a seemingly satisfactory contract\nfor the engines for the large aerodrome had been made it was thought\nthat rapid progress could be made on the constructional work after\nJanuary 1, 1899, when the allotment from the War Department would\nbecome available ◊\n[p133]\nCHAPTER III\nEXPERIMENTS WITH MODELS\nImmediately after the contract for the engine had been placed and\nthe actual work had been begun, attention was given to the problem\nof providing means for properly launching the aerodrome On the\ntheory that the plan of launching the small aerodromes, which had\nfinally been adopted after many years of painstaking experiment,\nwould be the best to employ for the large aerodrome, Mr Langley\ndecided to have constructed a large house-boat with the launching\ntrack arranged on it in a way similar to that used for the small\nmachines While the general plans for this boat had been under\nconsideration for some time, the actual working drawings were\ncompleted in January, 1899, and so great seemed the need for\nexpediting its construction, in order to have it ready at the time when\nthe engine was expected, that the contract which was made for its\nconstruction specifically provided for its being completed promptly,\nthere being a large forfeit to cover any delay on the part of the\ncontractor While the boat itself was being constructed, the working drawings\nwere completed for the house to be built on it, and a contract was\nmade for the construction of this house within a given period, there\nbeing also a time forfeit in this contract When the end of February arrived, it was found that, although the\nengine builder had succeeded in constructing an engine which\nweighed one hundred pounds, and which theoretically should have\ngiven something over twelve horse-power, yet he was unable to make\nit work properly And then began a protracted period of most\nexasperating delays, the engine builder promising from week to week\nthat certainly within the succeeding ten days he would be able to\nmake delivery of the engine developing the full horse-power for which\nthe contract called After this delay on the engine had continued for\nsome months—a delay which necessitated the cessation of the work\non the main steel frame of the aerodrome, as it was deemed best to\nmake certain tests of the engine running while supported by a portion\n\n\nof the frame to determine whether or not it was strong enough before\ncompleting the rest of it-—Mr Langley decided to employ part of the\ntime in the construction of a model of one-eighth the linear\ndimensions of the large aerodrome, which was to be used in testing a\nmodel of the newly designed launching apparatus described later, and\nwhich might also be flown as a kite in making check measurements on\nthe proper balancing which should be employed for the large\naerodrome [p134]\nThe perfected launching apparatus which had been used for the\nsteam-driven models Nos 5 and 6 (described in Part I, Chapter X ◊)\nhad proved most satisfactory and reliable, but when the designs were\nmade for a launching apparatus for the large machine it was found\nthat an exact duplication of the plan of the small one involved serious\ndifficulties in connection with the construction of the house-boat,\nowing to the very considerable weight and size of the turn-table\nnecessary to permit the aerodrome to be launched in any desired\ndirection, regardless of the direction in which the houseboat might be\npointing under the influence of the wind and tide A new design was\naccordingly made for a launching apparatus in which the launching\ncar was to run on a track mounted directly on the turn-table, the\nlaunching car supporting the aerodrome from underneath, instead of\nbeing mounted in an inverted position on an overhead track with the\naerodrome depending from it From the previous description of the launching apparatus, it will be\nrecalled that, in order to provide that the aerodrome should drop\nslightly at the moment of its release from the car, and thereby avoid\nall danger of entanglement, the speed of the launching car at the point\nat which the aerodrome was released was purposely made less than\nthe “soaring speed” of the aerodrome Having this feature in mind,\nwhen designing the “underneath” launching apparatus, it was\nrecognized that the danger of the aerodrome becoming entangled with\nthis form of apparatus could be avoided by making the launching\nspeed greater than the velocity which it would be necessary for the\naerodrome to have in order to soar, provided the balancing was correct\nand the aerodrome did soar Nevertheless, it was deemed unwise to put\ntoo much dependence on the empirical calculations from which the\nbalancing of the large aerodrome would necessarily be determined,\n\n\nand, therefore, some means seemed necessary for causing the\nlaunching car to drop out of the way immediately upon releasing the\naerodrome In the new design, more completely described below, in\nChapter IV ◊, this was accomplished by so arranging a portion of the\nfront end of the track that, at the moment the launching car released\nthe aerodrome, it dropped like a disappearing gun carriage, leaving\nthe aerodrome free in the air with no possibility of becoming\nentangled, provided the aerodrome itself did not drop more rapidly\nthan an angle of 15 degrees A small working model of this launching apparatus, one-eighth the\nlinear dimensions of that which would be necessary for the large\naerodrome, was first designed and constructed in the shop, the small\none-eighth-size model of the large aerodrome being launched from it\ninto a sheet stretched in front of it to act as a buffer When it was\nfound to work very satisfactorily, a large one, twice this size, was\nimmediately built for use with the steam-driven models Nos",
    "When it was\nfound to work very satisfactorily, a large one, twice this size, was\nimmediately built for use with the steam-driven models Nos 5 and 6 [p135]\nThese models, Nos 5 and 6, which had flown so successfully in\n1896, had, during the preceding twelve months, been completely\noverhauled and thoroughly tested in preparing them for trials in\nactual flight Many pendulum tests were made on both aerodromes,\nand it was found after repeated trial that each could be depended on\nto show a lift of sixty per cent of its flying weight This was more than sufficient for flight, but in order to insure\nsuccessful trials and avoid delay no aerodrome was launched until it\nhad shown previously its ability to generate enough power to\nmaintain for at least two minutes a lift of at least fifty per cent of the\ntotal flying weight This was more than sufficient for flight, but in order to insure\nsuccessful trials and avoid delay no aerodrome was launched until it\nhad shown previously its ability to generate enough power to\nmaintain for at least two minutes a lift of at least fifty per cent of the\ntotal flying weight Models Nos Models Nos 5 and 6, having thus proved their readiness for trial in\nflight, were accordingly, in April, 1899, taken to Chopawamsic Island,\ntogether with the old “overhead” launching apparatus and the new\none above described, and placed on a small house-boat similar to the\none which had been used in 1896 Two men were detailed for this\nspecial work, and were first employed in mounting the old launching\napparatus for a few preliminary tests with it, in order to make sure\nthat the aerodromes were in proper working order before trying them\non the new “underneath” one After considerable delay, due to various\n\n\ncauses, this apparatus and the aerodromes were got into proper\nworking condition, and during June, July and August the following\nflights were made with these machines, the record being condensed\nfrom the reports made by the writer to Mr Langley while he was\nabroad CONDENSED\nRECORD\nOF\nFLIGHTS\nOF\nAERODROMES\nNOS 5 AND 6 FROM\nJUNE\n7 TO\nAUGUST\n3, 1899\nJUNE\n7—AERODROME NO 6\nAfter making a preliminary test of the engines and boiler, with the\naerodrome mounted on benches inside the house-boat, to insure that\neverything connected with the power plant was in proper working\norder, the aerodrome was mounted on the launching apparatus on top\nof the house, the various parts were assembled and everything made\nready for a flight As it was calculated that this aerodrome would\nrequire a soaring speed of something like twenty-five feet a second,\nthe springs which furnished the motive power for the initial\nacceleration of the car were adjusted to the proper tension to cause it\nto reach a speed of approximately twenty-three feet a second at the\nmoment of launching Everything being in readiness the burners were\nlighted but worked somewhat sluggishly at first, so that two minutes\nwere consumed in raising a steam pressure of 110 pounds Although\nthis pressure should have been reached within one minute after\nlighting the burners, and the extra minute which had been consumed\nhad made a drain on the supply of fuel and water which should have\n[p136] been left for consumption during flight, yet it was thought best\nto launch the aerodrome, so at 12 37 p m the car was released and\nthe aerodrome launched The launching apparatus worked perfectly;\nthe aerodrome started off smoothly, and immediately after being\n\n\nreleased from the car it dropped slightly and began to turn to the\nright It had been impossible to move the house-boat out into the\nstream so as to point the launching apparatus directly into the wind,\nas one end had settled slightly on the muddy beach in consequence of\nthe existing low tide For this reason it was necessary to launch the\naerodrome due south, while the wind, which was very light, was from\nthe north-northeast, and, therefore, blowing on its port quarter The\neffect of the aerodrome turning to the right immediately after being\nlaunched was that it caused the wind to strike it to an increasing\nextent on the port side until, finally, it was going directly with the\nwind It did not, however, continue in this direction, but kept turning\nto the right in a circle until it headed directly into the wind, which,\nnow striking the under instead of the upper surface of the wings,\nimmediately caused the aerodrome to rise It continued circling,\nmaking three complete circles of approximately 200 feet diameter,\ndropping slightly when moving with the wind, but rising when\nmoving against it, until, at the completion of the third circle, it had\naltered its path to such an extent that the left front wing touched a\ntree and caused the front of the machine to dip a little It, however,\nkept up its flight, but the contact with the tree had so lowered its\nbow, and apparently also caused the wings to be twisted to such an\nextent, that it seemed unable to rise again, and after making another\nquarter circle it descended Although the propellers were still turning\nwhen it struck the water, they had very greatly decreased their speed,\nmaking it apparent that the power had been very greatly reduced\nthrough the exhaustion of the fuel and water supply The aerodrome\ndid not sink, but slowly drifted with the current of the creek and was\nrecovered in about five minutes and brought to the house-boat, where\nthe wings were dismounted and dried, and the metal parts were\ncarefully wiped off to prevent them from rusting The path of this\nflight is plotted on a portion of a coast-survey chart and is shown in\nPlate 33 PL 33 PATHS OF FLIGHT OF AERODROME NO 6, JUNE 7, 1899 ◊\nThis erratic circling at first seemed unaccountable, but on closer\nexamination, after the aerodrome had been brought into the house-\n\n\nboat, it was found that the pin which connects the synchronizing gear\nto the port propeller shaft had been sheared off This had evidently\nhappened while the aerodrome was still on the launching apparatus The effect of this was to throw the total work of the water-circulating\npump on the starboard engine, thus giving the port engine less work\nto do, and consequently making the port propeller run much faster\nthan the starboard one, and thereby causing the peculiar and erratic\ncircling of the aerodrome It is evident that the undulatory motion of\nthe [p137] aerodrome was due to the fact that, when it was moving\nagainst the wind, the speed relative to the air was greater than when\nit circled so as to go with the wind, and that this greater relative\nvelocity increased the lifting power of the aerodrome The total time of the flight was 57 seconds, and the distance\ncovered was between 2000 and 2500 feet, thus giving a speed of a\nlittle less than 30 miles an hour Comparing this flight with that of\nNovember 28, 1896, made by the same machine, it will be noted that\nin the earlier flight the velocity was practically the same, but that the\ntime of flight and the distance traversed then were nearly twice as\ngreat as in the present case A complete record of the details, not only of weight, but also of the\nposition of the wings, the center of gravity, etc , which show the exact\ncondition of the aerodrome when it made this flight, will be found in\nthe appendix (Data Sheet, No 3) JUNE\n13—AERODROME NO 6\nIn the flight of June 7 there was a slight trembling of the aerodrome\nwhile it was in the air, and although this was probably due to the fact\nthat the synchronizing gear was out of operation on account of the\nshearing off of one of the pins which held it, allowing the port engine\nto run faster than the starboard one, it was thought possible that some\nof the trembling might be due to the “wind-vane” rudder, which had\nbeen added to represent the equivalent of a steering device by which\nthe operator would control the direction of the large machine It was\ndecided, therefore, to omit the “wind-vane” rudder in the present test,\nbut to test the aerodrome with the same equipment of single-tier\nwings and Pénaud tail that had been used in the previous flight, the\nreel and float being moved to bring the CG the same as on June 7 Everything being in readiness, with the launching track pointed\nsouth, and the wind blowing only about\n5\n1\n2\nmiles an hour from the southwest, the burners were lighted and 63\nseconds were consumed before the steam pressure rose to 100 pounds Although the valve which controlled the burner was open to its full\nextent the pressure showed no tendency to rise above 100 pounds,\nwhich was not considered quite high enough to furnish sufficient\npower for a successful flight, but as it was desired to determine at\nonce at how low a steam pressure the aerodrome would fly\nsuccessfully, it was decided to launch it even at this pressure The\nlaunching apparatus was accordingly released and the aerodrome\nstarted off, gliding down about three feet immediately after being\nreleased, and then rising again, turning slightly to the right and then\nheading directly for the Virginia shore, where it seemed that it would\nsmash itself in the heavy growth of timber, but when it was about 250\nfeet from the shore it turned towards the right and started back\ntowards the island The wind, however, which was blowing from its\nrear, evidently got down the smoke-stack and put out the fire, [p138]\nfor the aerodrome commenced to descend as soon as it turned its back\nto the wind, and came down in the channel of the creek The path of\nthis flight is shown by the solid line in Plate 34 The total distance covered, as measured by plotting the course of its\nflight on the coast-survey chart, was about 1800 feet, and the length\nof time of flight was 40 seconds The aerodrome was immediately\nrecovered and brought into the house-boat, where it was found that\nthere were still about 1000 grammes of water and 100 grammes of\nfuel unused in it, showing conclusively that the fire had been put out\nby the wind Upon inspection it was found that the aerodrome was uninjured,\nand although the burner had not worked at all satisfactorily, yet as\nthe weather was exceedingly favorable it was decided to make\nanother trial with it immediately, using the superposed wings 39\nEverything being in readiness the burners were lighted, and 70\nseconds were consumed before the pressure rose to 90 pounds,\nbeyond which it was impossible to make it rise Although it was felt\n\n\ncertain that 90 pounds was not sufficient pressure to furnish the\npower necessary, yet as a storm was approaching in the distance, it\nwas decided to launch the aerodrome, as it could at least be\ndetermined whether it was properly balanced for the superposed\nwings When a total of 75 seconds had been consumed the car was\nreleased and the aerodrome was launched The wooden arrangement\nfor pressing down on the top of the wings to keep the aerodrome from\nbeing injured by the wind while it was on the car had been raised to\nthe proper height for the superposed wings, but it had not been\nnoticed that the sticks which support this arrangement had been\nelevated so much that they would come in contact with the beam\nextending across the boat, and from which the launching track was\nsupported Just as these sticks reached the cross-beam, however, it\nwas noticed that they projected about three inches above the lower\nside of it; but the next moment they struck it, and although the force\nwith which the car was running broke all four of them, the blow was\nsufficient to slow down the car, and thereby cause the aerodrome to\nbe launched at a very greatly reduced speed; not over one-fifth of\nwhat it should have been The shock of breaking these sticks evidently\njarred the burners so that the fire was extinguished, for the aerodrome\nshot forward for about 25 feet and settled with everything intact, and\nwith its midrod perfectly horizontal The aerodrome itself sustained\nabsolutely no injury, coming down as easily as though it had been\nlowered by a rope, and would have been given another trial\nimmediately but for the fact that it was very late in the afternoon and\ndarkness was rapidly approaching The data on setting of wings, tail,\netc , are shown on Data Sheet No 4 (Appendix) [p139]\nJUNE\n22—AERODROME NO 6\nAfter several days’ delay, due to numerous small but exceedingly\nannoying troubles,—such as the leaking of boilers because of defects\nin the copper tubing, and the bursting of the air tank, due to its being\npumped up to an excessive pressure, which a defective pressure gauge\nhad failed to indicate,-—Aerodrome No 6 was made ready for\nanother trial, and it was decided to test it again with the superposed\nwings which had been used in the second experiment of June 13 The\naerodrome was mounted on the “overhead” launching apparatus,\n\n\nwhich it will be remembered had been used in all the previous tests,\nand after 90 seconds had been consumed in raising a steam pressure\nof 110 pounds, it was launched directly into the wind, which was due\nsouth After leaving the launching car, the aerodrome flew straight\nahead for about 75 feet, when it suddenly turned its bow up into the\nair at an angle of about 15 degrees, and it seemed that the machine\nwould be blown back onto the house-boat However, when the rear\nend of the tail was within about 10 feet of the boat, and only about 10\nfeet above the water, it suddenly regained its equilibrium and went\nstraight ahead again in the face of the wind with the guy-posts only\nabout 4 feet above the surface of the water, flying almost exactly\nhorizontally for a distance of about 100 feet, when the bow again\nsuddenly became elevated As the aerodrome was so close to the\nwater, the wind forced it down until the burners were extinguished by\ncoming in contact with the water This brought the aerodrome to a\nstandstill absolutely uninjured, the propellers being several inches\nabove the water when they quit turning The aerodrome was brought\ninto the house-boat and thoroughly dried out, and another trial would\nhave been made with it immediately but the wind which had been\nsteadily increasing was now blowing something more than 12 miles\nan hour, and it was considered best not to attempt experiments in so\nstrong and gusty a wind, for fear of the wings being broken by the\nwind suddenly veering and striking them on the side or rear while the\naerodrome was still on the launching apparatus The peculiar action\nof the aerodrome in the air appeared to be due to the fact that the\npropellers interfered more with the lifting power of the rear\nsuperposed wings, as they were then constructed, than they did with\nthe “single-tier” ones The data on the setting of the wings, tail, etc ,\nare shown on Data Sheet No 5 (Appendix) It was also found after the experiment that one of the workmen, in\nassembling the machine on the launching car, had secretly increased\nthe stiffness of the spring which controls the elasticity of the Pénaud\ntail The effect of this increase in the stiffness of the Pénaud tail might\nat first thought appear to be similar to that of moving the center of\npressure forward Upon a closer analysis, however, it will be seen that\nthe effect is very much greater, as excessive stiffness of the Pénaud\ntail not only causes the aerodrome to elevate its bow, [p140] but\n\n\nrequires the overcoming of a strong downward force at the rear, even\nmore serious than would be caused by placing an extra load at the\nrear of the machine without regard to its effect on the balancing In\nexperiments of this kind, however, the workmen get certain ideas of\ntheir own as to how the work should be conducted, and it is almost\nimpossible in assembling the aerodrome to prevent them from making\nadjustments which are quite different from those which they have\nbeen directed to make, and which have been definitely planned with a\nview to determining the effect of slight changes which it is desired\nshall not be masked by changes of any kind in other details JUNE\n23—AERODROME NO 6\nThe wind, which had been blowing half a gale all day, gradually\nquieted down towards sunset and at five o’clock was very light,\nblowing only two miles an hour from the east-southeast As one of the\nrear superposed wings had been injured on the previous day in\ncarrying the aerodrome into the house-boat after its short and erratic\nflight, it was decided to use the “single-tier” wings in this experiment,\nand also to continue using the “overhead” launching apparatus for a\nfew more flights Everything being in readiness, the burners were\nlighted and 70 seconds were consumed in raising a steam pressure of\n120 pounds, at which pressure the aerodrome was launched It started\nstraight ahead, dropping not more than a foot, and flying on an\nabsolutely even keel for about 800 feet, when it suddenly turned to\nthe left and made a short half circle of about 100 feet diameter,\nheading for a point about 150 feet east of the house-boat When it was\nabout 200 feet from the shore, a sudden gust of wind caught under\nthe Pénaud tail, raising the rear portion of the aerodrome and causing\nthe bow to point down at an angle of about 30 degrees The\naerodrome kept this angle and struck the shallow water only about 20\nfeet from the shore The aerodrome was comparatively uninjured, and\nanother flight would have been made immediately but for the fact\nthat by the time the aerodrome had been properly inspected it was\nquite late, and entirely too dark, and there would have been danger of\nlosing it in the adjacent marshes, which are difficult to traverse even\nunder the best conditions of tide and light The path of this flight is\nshown by the dotted line in Plate 34 JUNE\n27—AERODROME NO 5\nWhile the preceding tests had been going on with Aerodrome No 6,\nsuch time as could be spared for it was spent in getting Aerodrome\nNo 5 into proper condition The copper tubing from which the boilers\nfor both aerodromes were made was greatly inferior to that which had\nbeen used in previous years, and as this tubing could be procured only\nby having it specially drawn to order in France, and as it required\nseveral months after placing an order before the [p141] tubing could be\ndelivered, it was necessary to make the best of what was already on\nhand The copper tubing for the boilers which had been used in 1896,\nafter being carefully annealed and filled with fine sand, could be\nwound into a perfectly smooth helix, free from all wrinkles,\nindentations, and so forth, on the inner side of the coil But no\namount of care, both in annealing and in winding this present lot of\ntubing, would produce a smooth helix, the tubing being badly\nwrinkled on the inner side of the coil in spite of every precaution These wrinkles, however, were not so much the cause of serious\ntrouble as was the fact that the tubing was not uniform in quality,\neach length of it having numerous rotten spots which did not always\nshow up in the winding, but which gave way after the boiler had been\ncompleted and one or two preliminary runs in the shop had been\nmade with it While the effect of such small things cannot be\nappreciated from merely reading about them, yet they were the cause\nof the most exasperating annoyance and delay, as no sooner had the\naerodrome been gotten into what appeared to be perfect working\norder than the boiler would break at one or more points, thus causing\na delay which at the moment would seem to involve not more than a\nfew hours, but before everything was again in working order would\namount to several days PL 34",
    "34 PATHS OF FLIGHT OF AERODROME NO 6,\nJUNE 13 AND 23, 1899\n◊\nHowever, after much perseverance, Aerodrome No 5 was put in\nsatisfactory working condition, and on June 27 was launched with its\n“single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail The data on settings of wings, tail,\n\n\netc , are given on Data Sheet No 6 After lighting the burners, 70\nseconds were consumed in raising a steam pressure of 120 pounds Immediately upon leaving the launching car the aerodrome started to\nrise with its bow elevated to an angle of about 15 degrees It flew\nstraight ahead about 80 feet, when it came backward and downward\nand touched the water about 40 feet from the boat The failure of the\naerodrome to fly properly was evidently due to its not being in proper\nbalance The cause of this lack of proper balance was not immediately\napparent, but was very soon detected and will be discussed later on JUNE\n30—AERODROME NO 5\nAfter several days of incessant rain and strong winds, which\nprevented an experiment, the weather became brighter and the wind\nquieted down and the afternoon of June 30 was almost ideal for an\nexperiment At five o’clock Aerodrome No 5, with “single-tier” wings\nand Pénaud tail, was placed on the launching apparatus, a few\nminutes later the burners were lighted, and just as the propellers\nstarted to turn a racking noise was heard Upon investigation it was\nfound that the circulating pump had broken The break was a very\nsmall matter and could have been repaired in an hour, but it was then\ntoo late to repair the damage and get a flight before dark, so the\naerodrome was reluctantly dismounted and the men put to work\nrepairing the broken pump [p142]\nJULY\n1 TO\nJULY\n8\nThe great disadvantage of conducting the experiments at a point\nforty miles from the city and the shops was felt at all times Workmen,\neven of the very best class, cannot be kept contentedly at work at a\npoint so far removed from their homes, even by bringing them to the\ncity on Saturday afternoon and carrying them back to the\nexperimental grounds the following Monday Moreover, it is worse\nthan useless to try to get even as much as one-third the ordinary\namount of work done if there is the slightest excuse for tightening\nanchor ropes, watching passing boats, or wasting time on any of the\nmultitudinous small variations from their usual routine of life On July 7, Aerodrome No 5, equipped with “single-tier” wings and\nPénaud tail, was made ready for a flight in the afternoon The settings\nof the wings, tail, etc , are given on Data Sheet 6 Using the\n“overhead” launching apparatus, the aerodrome was launched with a\nsteam pressure of 115 pounds Immediately upon being launched its\nbow rose to an angle of about fifteen degrees or more, and the\naerodrome came backward and downward and touched the water\nabout three or four feet from the house-boat It may be well to recall from what has been said in Part I, Chapter\nIX ◊, that Aerodrome No 5 is the one with the very low thrust line,\nand in 1896 had its “separator” several centimetres in front of its\ncenter of gravity When this aerodrome was overhauled just previous\nto these experiments, the separator was moved back to the same\nrelative position as that in Aerodrome No 6, so that the gradual\ndepletion of the water supply during flight would not cause it to\nbecome light in front of the center of gravity In the launching of Aerodrome No 5, above described, it showed no\ntendency to drop immediately upon leaving the launching ways, but\non the contrary its bow in every case rose almost immediately until it\nwas at an angle of about fifteen degrees or more From the\nphotograph (Plate 35) it will be noticed that the wings of the\naerodrome are held down by the longitudinal strips, A, fastened to\ncross-beams attached to the launching car If, now, the launching\nspeed is too great and the aerodrome tries to rise immediately upon\nbeing released, the front end, which passes from under the launching\ncar before the rear does, and is thus free to rise, will immediately rise,\nwhile the rear cannot rise until it has passed entirely in front of the\ncar, which being a distance of several feet requires an appreciable\nfraction of a second, during which time the bow of the machine has\nbeen able to rise to quite a steep angle This has the effect of slowing\ndown the aerodrome so that it does not get quite the proper chance to\nstart on its flight with a minimum head resistance In view of the above facts, it was decided to decrease the speed of\nthe launching car slightly when using Aerodrome No 5, so that this\nmatter could be thoroughly tested out PL 35 AERODROME NO 5 ON\n\n\nLAUNCHING-WAYS ◊\n[p143]\nJULY\n11 TO\nJULY\n14—AERODROME NO 5\nThe very early morning preceding actual sunrise on July 11 was\nundoubtedly as calm as it is possible to find; there was absolutely no\nbreeze stirring and the water in the river was as smooth as glass as far\nas one could see The anemometer cups were stationary, the wind\nvane stood absolutely parallel to the launching apparatus and\neverything promised a most successful experiment After mounting the\naerodrome on the “overhead” launching apparatus the burner was\nlighted, and while the steam pressure was still rising and the\npropellers were revolving faster and faster all the time, there was a\nsnap and they ceased to turn The fire, which was burning fiercely,\nran the pressure immediately to 150 pounds An attempt was at once\nmade to start the propellers again by giving them an initial turn by\nhand, it being thought possible that a sudden gush of water had taken\nplace and, accumulating in one end of the engine cylinder, had\nblocked the engine However, as the engine refused to keep the\npropellers going after they were started, and as the pressure was still\nrising very rapidly, the burner was shut off and an investigation made Upon removing the hull covering, it was found that the connecting\nrod bearing had broken off short near the crank pin of the engine, and\nthat it would be necessary to take the part to Washington in order to\nrepair it, as there were no machine tools on the house-boat After several days of exceedingly bad weather, the conditions grew\nmore favorable Late in the afternoon of July 14, Aerodrome No 5\nwas again placed on the “overhead” launching apparatus and\nprepared for a trial After lighting the burners, 95 seconds were\nrequired to raise a steam pressure of 120 pounds Upon leaving the\nlaunching apparatus the aerodrome went directly ahead for a few feet,\nbut immediately commenced to rise, elevating its bow to an angle of\n20 degrees by the time it had travelled 40 feet With its bow in this\nposition, it was blown back towards the house-boat and a little to the\nright of it, and, when within about 5 feet of the water, suddenly\n\n\nrighted itself and started ahead again, rising all the time and reaching\na height of about 20 feet by the time it had travelled 100 feet In the\nmeantime the bow had again become elevated to an angle of about 15\ndegrees and the aerodrome was blown backwards and downwards\nagain Just before reaching the water it started to right itself, but it\nhad descended so that the front guy-post was in the water, thus\ndestroying its equilibrium and causing it to settle into the water The\npath of this flight is shown by the peculiar S-shaped line in Plate 34 In the adjustments preliminary to the above trial the Pénaud tail\nwas elevated to an angle of\n7\n1\n2\ndegrees when the aerodrome was stationary in the shop This\nexcessive elevation, coupled with the fact that the center of gravity\nwas also probably a little too far forward, no doubt accounts for the\nerratic flight The data on setting of wings, tail, etc , are given on Data\nSheet No 7 (Appendix) [p144]\nJULY\n19—AERODROME NO 5\nAfter several days of exceedingly bad weather the conditions were\nmore favorable on July 19 Since the last experiment on July 14 the\ncoefficient of elasticity of the Pénaud tail had been decreased, the rear\nwings moved back 5 centimetres, and the “float” so placed that the\ncenter of gravity of the machine was brought to the same position it\nhad had on that day, that is, 2 centimetres back of the line of thrust With this arrangement, assuming that the CP is over the CG, we\nshould have an apparent efficiency of the rear wings of 63 6 per cent,\nsince the distance between CPfw, and CG is 79 7 centimetres, and the\ndistance between CPrw and CG is 125 3 centimetres With the\nadjustment of July 14, the distance between CPfw and CG was 79 7\ncentimetres, and the distance between CPrw and CG was 118 3\ncentimetres, thus allowing for an apparent efficiency of 67 37 per cent\nfor the rear wings It will be recalled that in the unsuccessful flight of\nJuly 14 the midrod of the aerodrome was inclined at an angle of\nabout 20 degrees during most of the time that it was in the air, thus\nindicating that the front wings were lifting proportionately more than\n\n\nthey should On July 14 the Pénaud tail had a negative elevation of 7°\n30′, and it required 1240 grammes placed at its center to bring it to\nthe horizontal On July 19 the elevation of the tail was changed to 5°\nand a weaker spring for controlling the elasticity was substituted, so\nthat it required only 200 grammes placed at the center of the tail to\nbring it to the horizontal A rubber band, of about one-half the\nstrength of the upper spring, was attached by means of a cord to the\nlower guy-post and the lower vertical ribs of the tail, so that the tail\nwould be elastic both ways This rubber band was in place and acting\nto help draw the tail down when the above measurement of the\ncoefficient of elasticity was made A rubber band connected to the\nlower side of the tail was also used in the flight of July 14, but it was\nso very weak, compared to the upper spring, that its effect was\nnegligible The effect of this change in the balancing of the aerodrome, and\nalso the more considerable effect which the coefficient of elasticity of\nthe tail has on the balancing, will be immediately noticed from the\ndescription of the next flight The data on setting of wings, tail, etc are given on Data Sheet No 8 At 3 p m , the wind having died down, Aerodrome No 5, equipped\nwith its “single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail adjusted as above, was\nplaced on the “overhead” launching apparatus After lighting the\nburners, one minute and thirty seconds were required to raise a steam\npressure of 120 pounds Immediately upon leaving the launching\napparatus, the aerodrome started straight ahead, dropping about 3\nfeet by the time it had gone 100 feet; it then rose with its midrod at\nan angle of about 6 or 8 degrees, regaining its level very quickly,\nhowever, and making three of these undulations by the time it had\ngone [p145] 300 feet It continued straight ahead for another 300 feet\nand began to circle to the left, the diameter of the first circle being\nabout 200 feet As soon as it started to circle, it rose with its midrod\nat an angle of about 15 degrees, and by the time it had made its first\nhalf turn it started to descend, coming down to within 15 feet of the\nwater As soon, however, as it had completed this first turn, it again\nrose, making another half circle, then, upon the completion of this\nhalf turn of the second circle, descended, this time to within 10 feet of\nthe water, rising again for the third half turn, but again descending to\n\n\nwithin 2 feet of the water at the completion of this third circle, and\nthen rising and completing the first half turn of the fourth circle By\nthis time, however, it had sunk so near to the water that the guy-posts\ncaught in the tall grass while it was descending just before the\ncompletion of the fourth circle, thus pulling the aerodrome down into\nthe water with the propellers still running The total time the\naerodrome was in the air was 46 seconds The total number of\nrevolutions of the propellers was 488, or at the mean rate of 637 R P M Upon examining the aerodrome, after it was recovered, it was\nfound that there were 925 grammes of water left in the separator, the\nfire having been put out by the aerodrome coming down into the\nwater When the aerodrome first commenced to circle during its flight, it\nwas noticed that the front wing clamps had twisted on the midrod, the\nleft wing being dipped downwards, and the right one, of course, being\nelevated, and the peculiar circling of the aerodrome was undoubtedly\ndue to this fact The cause of the wing clamp twisting on the midrod\nwas that one of the workmen forgot to tighten one of the screws of the\nwing clamp when the wings were being adjusted on the aerodrome But for this unfortunate twisting of the wings, it is probable that the\nflight would have been perfectly straight and the distance covered\nwould have been considerably greater than it was, the total path\ntraversed being about 2600 to 2800 feet, found by plotting the path\non the coast-survey chart and measuring it JULY\n27—AERODROME NO 6\nAs the proper balancing of both Aerodrome No 5 and No 6 had\nnow been determined with reasonable accuracy, and as much more\ntime had already been given to the experiments than had been\nintended, it was decided to dismount the “overhead” launching\napparatus at once and substitute the “underneath” one, so that it\ncould be immediately determined whether this newer plan for\nlaunching the aerodrome by a car supporting it from underneath\nwould be suitable for use with the large machine After a considerable\nperiod of exceedingly bad weather, during which time the change was\nmade in the launching apparatus, the weather conditions became\nmore favorable on July 27 Aerodrome No 6, equipped with “single-\n\n\ntier” wings and Pénaud tail, was mounted on the [p146] “underneath”\nlaunching apparatus, and everything was got ready for a flight On\nlighting the burners, they failed to work properly, and, upon\ninvestigation, it was found that the air valve controlling the air\npressure on the gasoline tank, was out of order While this was being\nrepaired, the wind rapidly increased in velocity and became very\ngusty, thus endangering the aerodrome, as the wings were very liable\nto be broken by the wind suddenly veering more rapidly than the\nhouse-boat could turn or the turn-table could be moved, and thus\nstriking the wings from the side and putting an enormous upward\npressure on them, owing to the fact that the diedral angle between\nthem gave to each wing an elevation of\n7\n1\n2\ndegrees from the horizontal The aerodrome was accordingly\ndismounted and everything kept in readiness for a trial, with the hope\nthat the wind would die down, or at least become steady, but it did\nnot do so until after dark JULY\n28—AERODROME NO 6\nAerodrome No 6, equipped with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud\ntail, was launched from the “underneath” launching apparatus There\nwas a dead calm, the river not showing a ripple; the wind vane\npointed to the northeast, but as the tide was low and the boat was\naground, the launching track was pointing due south At 7 a m",
    "m the\nburners were lighted, and 80 seconds were consumed in raising a\nsteam pressure of 120 pounds Everything worked perfectly; the\nuprights on the car, which initially support the aerodrome and upon\nits being released are instantaneously pulled down by rubber springs,\nas well as the disappearing part of the track, acted without the\nslightest hitch Immediately upon leaving the launching apparatus,\nthe aerodrome depressed its bow to an angle of between 3 and 4\ndegrees and made a direct line for the water At this angle it struck\njust on the opposite side of the channel, about 300 feet from the\nhouse-boat, and while several minor parts, such as guy-posts, were\ninjured no damage of importance was done Owing to the difficulty of\n\n\ngetting through the marsh and recovering Aerodrome No 6, it was\nfound impossible to make another trial with No 5 before the wind\nhad increased to a prohibitive velocity The path of this flight is\nshown by the dotted line in Plate 36 The data on setting of wings,\ntail, etc , are given on Data Sheet No 9 The last previous trial of Aerodrome No 6 was made on June 23,\nand the balancing at that time was evidently correct for the settings of\nthe tail which were then used The Pénaud tail then had an elevation\nof\n7\n1\n2\ndegrees, and the coefficient of elasticity was such that 1240 grammes\nwere required at the center of the tail to deflect it to the horizontal In\nthe trial above recorded, on July 28, the adjustments of the wings\nwere practically what they were on June 23, the CG being moved\nforward 1 centimetre, but the Pénaud tail had an elevation of\nsomething less than 5 degrees, and the coefficient of elasticity was\nsuch that [p147] 200 grammes placed at the center were required to\ndeflect the tail to a horizontal It was not intended that the angle of\nthe tail should have been less than 5 degrees, but it was found that\none of the workmen had improperly attached the fastening wire, and\nhad considerably decreased the angle This last adjustment of the\nPénaud tail should have been the same as that used on Aerodrome No 5 in its flight of July 19 The CG had purposely been moved forward\nslightly, but the effect of moving the CG forward and at the same time\ndecreasing the stiffness and angle of the tail was shown by this flight The above trial not only very clearly emphasizes the importance of\ncarefully determining what the elasticity of the Pénaud tail should be,\nbut also emphasizes the fact that even the best workmen, who have\nhad several years of experience, cannot be relied on in anything\nwhich requires that everything be done exactly right and not nearly\nright",
    "The above trial not only very clearly emphasizes the importance of\ncarefully determining what the elasticity of the Pénaud tail should be,\nbut also emphasizes the fact that even the best workmen, who have\nhad several years of experience, cannot be relied on in anything\nwhich requires that everything be done exactly right and not nearly\nright JULY\n29—AERODROME NO 5\nThe aerodrome equipped with “single-tier” wings and Pénaud tail\nwas launched from the “underneath” launching apparatus at 9 a m , 1\n\n\nminute and 30 seconds having been required to raise 120 pounds\nsteam pressure The wind was from the southeast, with a velocity of 3\nmiles an hour, and the launching track was pointed directly into it The launching apparatus, with the disappearing track, worked\nperfectly, and the aerodrome started straight ahead, dropping slightly\nat first, but immediately regaining its level and going ahead, gradually\nraising its bow to an angle of about 8 or 10 degrees, and slightly\nslacking up its speed by the time it had gone about 300 feet It then\nmade a circle to the left of a radius of about 75 feet and started back As soon as it had made this turn it regained its level and directly\nregained its speed But as soon as it had speeded up again it elevated\nits bow, which slackened its speed as before It then again righted\nitself, still going in the same direction and crossing the sand-bar on\nthe point of the island at a height of about 40 feet As soon as it had\ncrossed the sand-bar, it again made a circle to the left with a radius of\nabout 75 feet, heading directly for the house-boat, but when it had got\nback above the sand-bar it again circled to the left, passing directly\nbetween two tall trees, and barely missing them, and still circling to\nthe left, when it again reached the opposite side of the sand-bar It,\nhowever, kept on circling to the left and once more started back\ntowards the house-boat, this time passing to the left of the trees and\nagain barely missing them, and completing this, its second, circle over\nthe sand-bar It then started due north, heading directly for Quantico,\nbut by this time something had evidently happened to the burners as\nthe fire went out, and the propellers gradually slowed up However, it\nkept on towards Quantico, gradually descending on an even keel, and\ncame down in the water at a point about 500 feet [p148] from the\nsand-bar and about 1000 feet from the house-boat The propellers had\nalmost ceased turning when the aerodrome came down into the water,\nand it settled almost as quietly as though it had been picked up and\nplaced there, so that no damage was done to it The total time that the aerodrome was in the air was 63 seconds,\nand the total length of flight was about 2500 feet The path of this\nflight is shown by the dotted line with the double circle in Plate 36 The data on settings of wings, tail, etc , are given on Data Sheet No 10 As soon as the workmen had had their breakfast, Aerodrome No 5\n\n\nwas again placed on the launching apparatus, equipped this time with\nthe superposed wings and Pénaud tail Upon lighting the burners, it\nwas found that they did not work properly, a small piece of soot\nhaving clogged up the tip of the vaporizing coil While this trouble\nwith the burners was being remedied, the wind increased to such an\nextent that it was found necessary to remove the aerodrome from the\nlaunching apparatus to prevent its being injured by side gusts As it\nwas Saturday and the wind showed no signs of quieting down, the\nexperiments were discontinued until the next week AUGUST\n1—AERODROME NO 5\nAfter placing the aerodrome on the launching apparatus and getting\neverything in readiness for a flight, upon lighting the burners a\nsudden sheet of flame shot out of the smoke-stack and so seriously\ncharred three panels of each of the rear wings that they had to be\nremoved for repairs The silk covering of the wings had been coated\nwith a special fire-proofing preparation, but the intensely hot flame,\nof course, charred all the silk that it came in contact with By the time that the wings had been repaired, and the defect in the\nburner which caused the accident had been remedied, a severe storm\nhad arisen, making it necessary to remove everything to the interior\nof the boat While waiting for the weather to become more suitable, a\ntest of the engine of Aerodrome No 5 was made inside of the house-\nboat In this test a steam pressure of 140 pounds was obtained, giving\n650 R P M of the round-end, 100-centimetre propellers, which\nprevious tests had shown to mean a thrust of 7480 grammes As the\nflying weight of the aerodrome was now 14,104 grammes, the thrust\nobtained would correspond to a lift of 53 per cent of the flying\nweight, which was maintained in this test for 90 seconds As the CG of Aerodrome No 5 seemed to be a little too far forward\nin the flight of July 28, it was decided to change it slightly, and it was\nmoved back 4 millimetres PL 36 PATHS OF FLIGHT OF AERODROME NO 5, JULY 29, 1899 ◊\nA trial run in the house-boat was also made on Aerodrome No 6,\nwhile waiting for the weather to become more suitable, but,\nunfortunately, the result of this test was disastrous The aerodrome\nhad been placed on trestles and [p149] held down to the floor by wires\nfastened to the cross-frame In the midst of the test one of the wires\nslipped, allowing the aerodrome to push forward and thus permitting\nthe propellers to come in contact with the wires which held it to the\nfloor Both propellers were entirely demolished and the cross-frame\nwas broken off short just at the right-hand engine The disaster was\nentirely due to the carelessness of one of the workmen in tightening\none of these wires, a further example of the extreme heedlessness of\nworkmen, even in the most important details, which concern the very\nexistence of the machine AUGUST\n3—AERODROME NO 5\nAfter the very satisfactory trial of Aerodrome No 5 in the shop two\ndays previous, it was hoped, now that the weather had become\nsuitable, that a good flight with the superposed wings would be\nobtained The aerodrome, equipped with these wings, was accordingly\nplaced on the launching apparatus and the burners were lighted, but\nthey refused to work properly, a steam pressure of only 80 pounds\nbeing obtained After much delay the burners were finally got to work\nproperly, but the wind had increased in velocity to such an extent that\nit was necessary to remove the aerodrome to the interior of the house-\nboat As the wind continued to increase in velocity it was decided to\nmake another trial of the aerodrome inside of the house-boat Upon\ndoing this it was very soon found that there was a small leak in the\nfront turn of one of the coils of the boiler, and the steam from this\nplayed directly against the burner, causing it to work intermittently A\nnew coil was substituted, and after some adjustment a very excellent\nrun was obtained, the steam pressure reaching 130 pounds and the\npropellers making 654 R P M In the afternoon the wind quieted down and the aerodrome,\nequipped with superposed wings, was again placed on the launching\n\n\napparatus The burners were lighted but again refused to work\nproperly, the vaporizing tip being stopped up with soot This caused\nthe burner to “flood,” which sent a sheet of flame through the stack\nand burned the rear right wing A new wing was substituted, the burner tip was cleaned out and\neverything was again put in readiness for a flight Upon lighting the\nburners, 1 minute and 58 seconds were required to raise 120 pounds\nsteam pressure",
    "Upon lighting the\nburners, 1 minute and 58 seconds were required to raise 120 pounds\nsteam pressure The underneath launching apparatus, with the\ndisappearing track, worked perfectly, the aerodrome dropping\nslightly, but going straight ahead It, however, continued to descend\nfor a distance of about 100 feet, the bow being elevated about 5\ndegrees The bow then became horizontal, the aerodrome rising\nslightly at the same time, but going only about 50 feet farther, when it\nagain started to descend slightly, and finally settled gently on the\nwater between 300 and 500 feet from the house-boat, with its bow\nelevated about 3 degrees There was a hiss as the hull touched the\nwater, showing that the fire was still burning and making it [p150]\nimprobable that the failure of the flight was due to lack of power The\ndata on settings of wings, tail, etc , are given on Data Sheet No 11 The speed of the launching car, one foot in front of the point at\nwhich the aerodrome was released, was twenty feet a second, as\nshown by the carbon record sheet carried by the launching car and\nmoved in front of a tuning fork which had been set in vibration The aerodrome, being uninjured in the previous flight, was again\nplaced on the “underneath” launching apparatus, and before attaching\nthe wings a short run was made in order to see that everything was in\nproper working condition As everything seemed to be all right, the\nwings and tail were immediately adjusted for another trial As the\nbow was slightly elevated in the previous trial, it was thought best to\nbring the CG a little farther forward, and this was accordingly done As the aerodrome also seemed to drop slightly in leaving the\nlaunching car in the above trial, the tension of the launching springs\nwas slightly increased so as to increase the velocity at the moment of\nrelease Just as the sun was setting the aerodrome was again launched, 1\nminute and 30 seconds having been required to raise 120 pounds\nsteam pressure, but the pressure was rising very rapidly at the\n\n\nmoment of launching There was an absolutely dead calm prevailing,\nthe river being as smooth as glass The launching apparatus, with the\ndisappearing track, worked perfectly Immediately upon being\nreleased the aerodrome went straight ahead, with its midrod\nhorizontal, but gradually glided downward as though the wings had\nvery little lifting power, and settled in the water about 200 feet from\nthe house-boat The velocity of the launching car, 1 foot before the\naerodrome was released, was 22 feet a second, as shown by the\ncarbon record sheet In the above trials of the superposed wings, the conditions of the\nwind and of the aerodrome were certainly as favorable as could be\nexpected There was as much power being furnished by the engine as\nhad been furnished in the previous flights with the “single-tier” wings,\nand the balancing of the aerodrome was exceedingly good The\nsuperposed wings, unquestionably, had a fair trial and proved inferior\nto the “single-tier” ones, for they had a supporting surface of 2 75\nsquare feet to the pound, whereas with the “single-tier” wings there\nwas approximately 2 square feet to the pound The decreased lifting\npower of the superposed wings seems to be another confirmation of\nthe results of the Allegheny experiments with the “plane-dropper ”40\nAs more time had already been given to these tests than it seemed\nwell to [p151] spend on them at that time, owing to the pressure of the\nwork of construction for the large machine, it was deemed best to\ndiscontinue them for the time being, and as soon as time could be\nfound for it, to construct a set of wings with superposed surfaces,\nusing only two surfaces and making their distance apart at least equal\nto or greater than their width It will be remembered that the prime object in making these tests\nwas to obtain data for use in the balancing of the large aerodrome and\nin constructing a launching apparatus for it The chief deductions\ndrawn from them were: First: That it would be best to construct the\nfirst set of wings for the large machine on the “single-tier” plan, and\nlater to make a set of superposed ones, should further experiments\nwith new designs develop a type of superposed surfaces which gave as\ngood lifting power as the “single-tier” ones Second: That the\nproportioning of the coefficient of elasticity of the Pénaud tail should\nbe given as careful attention as the setting of the wings Third: That\n\n\nthe “underneath” launching apparatus was equally as good as the\n“overhead” one, and that both worked as well as could be desired;\nand, fourth, that while short periods of calm weather might be\nexpected during some part of the day on a portion of the days of each\nmonth, yet the most favorable conditions were more apt to be met\nwith between the first break of day and the actual rising of the sun, or\nfrom an hour preceding sunset until darkness actually came It will be noted that while considerable delay was experienced in\nmaking these tests, nearly all of it was due to the very delicate\nadjustments required in the power-generating apparatus of the\naerodrome, but it should also be noted that when these adjustments\nwere accurately made the models operated exceedingly well, and\ncould be depended upon to give good flights of sufficient duration to\npermit a careful study of their action while in the air In the experiments of June 27 and July 7, above described, the\naerodrome immediately after leaving the launching apparatus began\nto rise with its midrod pointed upward at an angle of about 15\ndegrees From Data Sheet No 6, which gives in detail the important\ndata as to the settings of the wings, the elasticity of the Pénaud tail,41\netc , we note that the tail had a negative angle of\n7\n1\n2\ndegrees, and that the spring which held it at this angle was of such a\nstiffness that it required 1240 grammes placed at its center of figure to\ndepress it to the horizontal It will also be noticed that the position of\nthe front and rear [p152] wings relative to the center of gravity of the\nmachine was not the same as that which existed at the time of the\nvery successful flights of 1896, as shown by Data Sheet No",
    "It will also be noticed that the position of\nthe front and rear [p152] wings relative to the center of gravity of the\nmachine was not the same as that which existed at the time of the\nvery successful flights of 1896, as shown by Data Sheet No 1 of No 5,\nMay 6, 1896 When the elasticity of the tail was adjusted before\nmaking this test it was thought that it was made the same as in the\nexperiments of 1896, though accurate data as to the exact amount of\nthis elasticity had, unfortunately, not been kept A slight change had also been made in the method employed of\nattaching the Pénaud tail to the machine In 1896 the tail was\nattached to the machine by means of a flat piece of wood (hickory)\nwhich had been steamed and bent to the proper extent to cause the\nrudder to have a negative angle of about 5 degrees, but no accurate\n\n\nnote was made of its angle or stiffness, so that in 1899 no data were\navailable as to exactly what the angle had been or how stiff the spring\nwas Owing to the fact that wood not only warps and twists, but also\nthat any piece which has been steamed and bent gradually loses a\ncertain amount of its curvature, it was decided in 1898 to change this\nmethod of attaching the tail, the wooden spring being replaced by a\ncoiled steel spring attached to an upper guy-post and connected to the\ntail by a bridle wire fastened to the center of figure of the tail After the experiment of July 7, 1899, a lower spring, consisting of\nsmall rubber bands, was connected by a wire to the lower part of the\nrudder and fastened to the guy-post, thereby more nearly reproducing\nthe conditions obtained when using a wooden spring, which, of\ncourse, tends to return the rudder to its normal position when it is\ndisplaced in either direction After attaching this lower spring to the\nrudder, the experiment of July 14 was made, and it was found that\nthe aerodrome still flew with its midrod pointed upward at a very\nsteep angle It was, therefore, felt certain that the upper spring on the\nrudder was too stiff, and that it should not require so much as 1240\ngrammes to bring it to the horizontal This spring was, therefore,\nreplaced by a weaker one, and the angle of the rudder was also\ndecreased until it had a negative angle of only 5 degrees and required\nonly 200 grammes placed at its center of figure to bring it to the\nhorizontal From the description of the flight of July 19, it will be\nseen that these changes immediately corrected the tendency of the\naerodrome to point its nose upward at such a sharp angle, and it will\nbe later seen that after a further slight adjustment the flight of July 29\nwas made, in which the proper balancing was obtained and the\naerodrome made a good horizontal flight After these preliminary tests with the “overhead” launching\napparatus, it was dismounted and the “underneath” one substituted\nand the experiments of July 28, 29 and August 3 were made Everything connected with this “underneath” launching apparatus\nworked perfectly from the start and four flights of the aerodromes\nwere made using it",
    "Everything connected with this “underneath” launching apparatus\nworked perfectly from the start and four flights of the aerodromes\nwere made using it PL 37 37 EXPERIMENTAL FORMS OF SUPERPOSED SURFACES, 1898, 1899\n(SEE ALSO PLATES 64 AND 65) ◊\n\n\n[p153]\nIt will be recalled that in “Experiments in Aerodynamics” Mr Langley made tests of the soaring speed, etc Langley made tests of the soaring speed, etc , of surfaces when\nsuperposed In many of his experiments with rubber-driven models,\nhe also employed superposed surfaces During the summer of 1898\nseveral forms of superposed surfaces, of a proper size for use on the\nsteam-driven models Nos 5 and 6, were constructed and were tested\nunder as nearly as possible the same conditions as would exist when\nused on the aerodrome, by mounting the surfaces on the whirling-\ntable and measuring their soaring speed, lift, drift, etc , to determine\njust what arrangement of surfaces gave the greatest lifting effect with\nthe least resistance Two of the forms which were tested are shown in\nPlate 37, Figs 1 and 2, and Plates 64 and 65 At the conclusion of\nthese tests, it was decided to construct a set of surfaces on the plan\nshown in Plates 64 and 65, and to have them ready for use on either\nof the models Nos 5 and 6 5 and 6 These surfaces were taken to\nChopawamsic Island in April, 1899, when all of the other aerodromic\nmaterial was first carried there It was planned to make some tests\nwith them to determine whether or not it would be best to use\nsuperposed surfaces on the large aerodrome or to follow the plan of\n“single-tier” ones, which had the great advantage of having already\nproved their worth in the successful flights of the models On August\n3, Aerodrome No 5, equipped with these superposed surfaces, was\nlaunched",
    "5, equipped with these superposed surfaces, was\nlaunched It will be noted from Data Sheet No 11 that the superficial\narea of the superposed surfaces was considerably greater than that\nprovided by the “single-tier” ones, and on the assumption of the same\nefficiency per unit of surface in both cases, the aerodrome should\nhave soared at a less speed and required less power when using the\nsuperposed surfaces The results obtained, however, were just the\nreverse, the aerodrome being unable to sustain itself when using the\nsuperposed surfaces, whereas with the “single-tier” ones it was\nevident that a slight excess weight might easily have been carried\nwithout preventing the aerodrome from soaring properly While it was\nfelt that these tests were not entirely conclusive as to the superior\nlifting power of the “single-tier” surfaces, yet as the engine builder\nwas constantly promising, each time with increased emphasis, that he\nwould within less than a fortnight deliver the engine for the large\n\n\naerodrome, and that it would develop even more power than the\nspecifications called for, it was deemed best to cease the experiments\nwith the models and concentrate all effort on the completion of the\nlarge aerodrome frame and the construction of a set of “single-tier”\nsupporting surfaces for it It was recognized from the first that the\n“single-tier” supporting surfaces lacked the rigidity which could be\nsecured by the truss construction afforded by the superposed plan, yet\nthese models, which were the only machines in the history of the\nworld that had ever flown successfully, had been equipped with\n“single-tier” surfaces; and the experience so dearly bought during the\nlong [p154] years of development of these models had taught the very\nvaluable lesson that in work of this kind where we have no margin on\nanything, but everything has to be calculated on the “knife-edge”\nbasis, it is an exceedingly unwise thing to introduce any modification\nfrom what has been proved to be satisfactory, unless such\nmodification is absolutely necessary The principal object in building the one-eighth size model of the\nlarge aerodrome, as mentioned in the first part of this chapter, was to\ndetermine by actual experiment whether the new form of\n“underneath” launching apparatus, which had just been designed, was\nlikely to prove as satisfactory as the original “overhead” type, which\nhad been used in the successful flights of the models in 1896 Yet after\nit was completed this aerodrome was found so very strong and stiff,\neven though roughly constructed by merely tying the joints of the\ntubing together with wires and soldering over the joints, that it was\ndecided to equip it with power, if a suitable form of power could be\nfound which could be easily applied Just at this time liquid air as a\nmotive power was attracting considerable attention all over the\ncountry, and attempts were made to procure a small power plant for\noperation by liquid air After devoting considerable time to the matter\nit was found impossible to do anything with it just at that time, as the\nliquified air could not be obtained in Washington, and one of the chief\nexperimenters in New York, who had been given a commission to\nmake certain experiments at his plant, so continuously delayed\nbeginning them that it was found necessary to give up the idea However, after the completion of the tests of the launching\napparatus some experiments were made in flying the model as a kite For this purpose a mast twenty feet high was constructed and so\narranged that it could be mounted at the center of a small power\nlaunch The model aerodrome was flown by a cord connected to it by\na bridle, the cord passing over a swivel pulley on top of the mast and\ndown into the boat, whence it could be played out or hauled in as\noccasion required By heading the launch into the wind it was possible\nto secure sufficient relative velocity to cause the model to support\nitself and a number of tests were made in this way It was found that\nwhen the bridle was attached at the point at which the propellers\nwould deliver their thrust, had they been in use and driven by power,\nthe model flew exceedingly well, maintaining its equilibrium even\nduring very strong gusts Owing to the rolling produced by waves\nfrom the large boats which were continually passing in the part of the\nriver where these tests were made, the power launch was often in\ndanger of being upset by its tall mast; and finally, when the tests were\njust reaching the point where accurate information was being\nobtained on the balancing of the model, a sudden rolling of the boat\ncaused the mast to snap off while the model was in the air Before it\ncould be picked up from the water a passing boat had swamped it and\nit was lost in the river [p155]\nAlthough the model was, as has been said, rudely constructed and,\ntherefore, did not represent a serious loss, yet the pressure of the more\nimportant construction work for the large machine prohibited the\nconstruction of another rough model for continuing these kite\nexperiments, which it was felt could not at best be more than\napproximate indications of the general stability of the machine under\npractical conditions ◊\n[p156]\nCHAPTER IV\nHOUSE-BOAT AND LAUNCHING APPARATUS\nThe use of a house-boat seemed to Mr Langley so indispensable in\nformer years in making open-air tests of the models that he decided\nfrom the outset, though advised by the writer against doing so, to use\nthe same plan on a much larger scale in connection with the large\naerodrome Aside from its supposed utility as a convenient and\napparently safe place from which to launch the aerodrome, the house-\nboat was valuable as a portable workshop for making necessary\nrepairs and as a temporary storehouse for the apparatus, thereby\nsaving much packing and unpacking It also provided sleeping\nquarters for the workmen It was early seen that this plan would require a boat at least 60 by\n40 feet, which could be built only at a large initial cost But as the\nexperience with models had so firmly convinced Mr Langley that it\nwas necessary not only that the aerodrome be launched over the\nwater, but also at a considerable height above it, and from a station\nthat commanded all points of the compass, he decided to adopt this\nplan for the large aerodrome, and designs for such a boat were\naccordingly made in the latter part of 1898 In order to insure the completion of this house-boat by the time the\naerodrome was expected to be ready for trial, it was built under\ncontract Immediately after its delivery in May, 1899, work was begun\non the superstructure which carried the launching track This\nsuperstructure was a considerable undertaking, involving a turn-table\nweighing about 15 tons, supported on a double circular track, and this\ntrack in turn was supported entirely from the side walls of the house\nto avoid having columns in the middle of the floor From the\nphotographs, Plate 38, Figs 1, 2 and 3, it will be seen that the entire\nsuperstructure was supported by three trussed girders extending\nacross the boat above the roof and carried by vertical posts built into\nthe side walls of the house The turn-table was 48 feet square and the\nlaunching track carried by it was 5 feet gauge by 80 feet long FIG 1 FIG 2 FIG 3 PL 38",
    "38 HOUSE-BOAT AND LAUNCHING APPARATUS,\n1899 ◊\nIn making tests of the models, it had been the practice to carry the\nmain body of the aerodrome up a ladder to the upper works of the\nboat, the wings being also carried up in the same manner As the large\naerodrome was expected to weigh at least 640 pounds, of which 350\npounds would be the steel frame with its undetachable parts, such as\nthe engine and its appurtenances, it was seen that something more\neffective than a ladder would need to be provided for getting the\naerodrome from the interior of the boat to the launching track [p157]\nabove It was therefore decided to place the upper works of the boat\nrather nearer the rear end than the front, thus leaving a space over\nthe front end of the house through which a large trap-door might be\ncut in the roof, and it was thought that in this way the aerodrome\nmight be passed up to the launching track by the use of suitable ropes\nand pulleys The upper works were so arranged, and a sliding trap-\ndoor was provided in the roof, but more intimate knowledge of the\ndifficulties of handling so large and heavy a frame made it certain,\neven before the aerodrome was ever placed upon the house-boat, that\nit would be impossible to transport it to the upper works by passing it\nthrough the trap-door A different plan was then resorted to A very\nlarge door was constructed at the rear end of the house, through\nwhich the completely assembled frame could be carried in a level\nposition and placed upon a large raft, consisting of a lattice flooring\nover pontoons, moored at the rear end of the boat, as clearly seen in\nPlate 38 In order to raise the aerodrome frame from the raft to the\nupper works, a large, but light, mast and boom, with suitable stays\nwere provided As the wings, when mounted in their proper position\non the aerodrome, would be interfered with by such a mast, the mast\nand boom were so devised as to be capable of rapid erection and\ndismounting, only five minutes being necessary for either operation In Plate 38 the mast and boom are seen in position in Fig 3, while in\nFigs 1 and 2 they have been dismounted The construction of the launching track and car was begun in\nNovember, 1899, but their completion was long delayed, as they were\nfrequently put aside for the more immediately important parts of the\nwork Moreover, the arrangement of the struts and clutch of the\nlaunching car depended entirely on the form and dimensions of the\nframe of the aerodrome, which could not be entirely decided until a\nproper engine had been secured and tested in the frame to determine\nwhat modifications of it were necessary In the spring of 1902,\nhowever, the launching car was entirely finished and a number of\ntests of the large engine were made in the shop with the frame\nmounted in position on the car From the description of the “overhead” launching apparatus (Part I,\nChapter X ◊) which had proved so successful in the tests of the\nmodels, both in 1896 and in the later experiments of 1899, it will be\nrecalled that the essential features of it were a track and a light car\nwith three hinged struts which extended below the body of the car,\nand against which suitable co-acting bearing points attached to the\nframe of the aerodrome were tightly drawn by means of a clutch\nwhich gripped a special fitting fastened to the aerodrome frame near\nthe central point of its length After the engine of the aerodrome had\nbeen started and got to running at full speed, the car was released and\nmoved forward along its track by the combined force of the thrust of\nthe propellers and the pull of the coiled launching springs Just before\nthe car reached the forward end of the track, a cam at this point\ncaused the clutch to open and release [p158] the aerodrome, which\nimmediately dropped slightly, as it had purposely not quite reached a\nspeed sufficient to cause it to soar This slight drop of the aerodrome,\neven if it were only a fraction of an inch, made it possible for the\nhinged struts, against which it had been held by the clutch, to be\nfolded up by their special springs against the floor of the car, thus\nleaving the aerodrome free in the air without danger of entanglement The struts referred to above were three in number, two being\nplaced near the rear and one at the center of the front of the car The\nuse of three points of support had the advantage of furnishing a rather\nrigid foundation against which the frame could be tightly drawn by\nmeans of the clutch-hook without risk of straining it In designing the\n“underneath” launching apparatus, which was very thoroughly tested\n\n\nin the experiments with the models in the summer of 1899, the plan\nof having three struts with the aerodrome drawn tightly against them\nby means of a central clutch-hook was continued with most\nsatisfactory results When the position of the struts on this launching apparatus had\nbeen changed so as to permit it to be used for the quarter-size model,\nit was found, in making shop tests of the engine with the aerodrome\nmounted on the launching car, that, owing to the greater vibration\nproduced by the gasoline engine, the three points of suspension did\nnot hold the model in a sufficiently rigid manner It became\nnecessary, therefore, to use four struts, the two rear ones being left as\nbefore, and the single one in front being replaced by two\ninterconnected ones arranged similarly to those in the rear After\nmaking this change no difficulty was found in holding the aerodrome\nrigidly against the struts, and this modification was therefore\nimmediately introduced in the designs for the large launching car\nwhich was already under construction PL 39",
    "39 METHOD OF ATTACHING GUY-WIRES TO GUY-POSTS TO RELIEVE\nTORSIONAL STRAIN ◊\nExperience, both with models 5 and 6, and with the quarter-size\nmodel, had also demonstrated the necessity of providing some means\nwhereby the aerodrome frame would be relieved of the torsional\nstrains produced upon it by a side wind striking the under surface of\nthe wings when the aerodrome was mounted on the car preparatory\nto a test The means for preventing these torsional strains in the case\nof the models, when “overhead” type of launching car was used, has\nbeen described in Chapter X of Part I ◊ However, with the\n“underneath” type of launching car, a different means was necessary A plan, in which outriggers projected from the body of the car and\nwires running from these outriggers up to the main ribs of the wings,\nwith means for releasing the wires just before the car reached the end\nof the track, was used with the “underneath” car in the tests of models\n5 and 6 in the summer of 1899, but the outriggers were frequently\nderanged by the sudden stopping of the car at the end of the run and\nthey were replaced by a simpler arrangement In this plan the\n\n\ntorsional strains were relieved by providing, at the forward and rear\nends [p159] of the car, smaller hinged uprights furnished in their upper\npart with a small slot into which a pin projected from the bottom of\nthe forward and rear guy-posts, respectively The guy-wires from\nwings being connected to the lower ends of the guy-posts the torsional\nstrain produced by a side wind was immediately transmitted from the\nwings through the guy-wires to the guy-post, whence it was\ntransmitted to the car itself, and thus prevented from acting on the\nmetal frame of the aerodrome, as shown in Plate 39 These additional\nshort struts for taking up the torsional strain were first added to the\nsmall launching car in 1901, and in the succeeding tests made with\nthe quarter-size model no trouble of any kind was indicated as likely\nto be caused by them As it was these extra struts which were directly\nresponsible for the accident in the launching of the large aerodrome\nOctober 7, 1903, at the time of its first trial, and possibly also for that\non December 8, 1903, at the time of the second trial, special attention\nis here called to them The length of travel which could be provided for the launching car\nin the case of the large aerodrome, as well as in that of the models\nwas necessarily very limited, owing to the fact that the track had to be\nconstructed on the top of the house of the boat It was therefore\nnecessary, in order that the aerodrome might attain a speed sufficient\nfor soaring before being launched, to keep the weight of the launching\ncar as small as possible, a given spring tension being capable of\naccelerating a given mass a definite amount in a given length of\ntravel With a heavier launching car the spring tension would have to\nbe increased Moreover, since the blow which would be struck when\nthe car was suddenly stopped at the end of the track, would depend\non its mass as well as its velocity, there was an additional reason for\ntrying to keep the weight of the car as small as possible While it was found perfectly feasible to keep the weight of the\nlaunching car for the model low enough for practical purposes, in\ndesigning the launching car for the large aerodrome it was only by\neliminating all flooring of the car and providing merely a box frame\nwith necessary cross-braces, that its weight was kept within what\nappeared reasonable limits Even then the blow which it would strike\nwhen it reached the end of the track was found by calculation to be\n\n\nexceedingly formidable Referring to the drawings of Plate 40, Figs 1, 2 and 3, it will be\nseen that the large launching car consisted essentially of two parallel\nlongitudinal side members 6 inches deep by 1 5 inches thick by 19\nfeet long, connected by three main sets of cross-members: one set near\nthe rear, at the point at which the rear struts for supporting the\naerodrome were mounted; a second rather heavier set about the\nmiddle of its length, at the point where the strut which carried the\nclutch-hook was mounted; and a third near the front, at the point\nwhere the front struts were mounted Projecting from the forward end\nof each of the [p160] longitudinal side members were piston rods, on\nwhich were mounted leather-cup pistons, which co-acted with buffer\ncylinders fixed at the extreme front of the track to absorb the blow\nwhen the car reached them at the end of its travel The car was\nsupported on each side by means of four hangers (Figs 4 and 5)\nwhich carried grooved wheels having ball-bearings and running on a\nsteel track consisting of flat plates fastened on the side of the timbers\nof the launching track On the extreme lower point of these hangers\nwere small guide pulleys, so placed as to be just below and out of\ncontact with a guard rail on the side of the launching track, thus\npreventing any possibility of the launching car being raised from the\ntrack either during its forward motion or by a side wind striking\nunderneath the wings",
    "On the extreme lower point of these hangers\nwere small guide pulleys, so placed as to be just below and out of\ncontact with a guard rail on the side of the launching track, thus\npreventing any

PREPARATORY TO LAUNCHING\nAERODROME ◊\nOn the large launching car the arrangement of the struts against\nwhich the bearing points of the frame were tightly drawn by the\nclutch was similar in all respects to that used on the model car, there\nbeing only slight differences in details The details of the uprights on\nwhich the bearing points of the aerodrome frame rested are clearly\nshown in Figs 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Plate 40 From the photographs (Plate\n41, Figs 1, 2, and 3) which show the large frame mounted on the\nlaunching car, the general arrangement of the struts and the clutch-\nhook can be readily seen; and from Plate 42, Figs 1, 2, and 3, which\nshow in detail most of the important features of the clutch-post and its\nclutch, a very good idea of the size of the different parts may be had\nby observing that the distance from the fulcrum of each half of the\nhook to the pin by which it was connected through the universal joint\nto the vertical rods is five inches As previously stated, this clutch-\nhook gripped the lower pyramid and pulled the bearing points of the\nframe firmly against the forward and rear struts of the launching car,\nand in launching the aerodrome the triggers arranged on the bottom\nof the car, which at the proper time pull on the vertical rods and\nthereby force the two halves of the clutch-hook apart, are so arranged\nthat they strike a cross-beam at the front end of the track one inch\nbefore the triggers, which keep the struts from being pulled down by\ntheir springs, which tend to fold them up and force them down\nagainst the car The triggers, which prevent the struts from being\nfolded down, strike a cross-beam in the track one foot before the\nbuffer pistons on the end of the car begin to enter the buffer cylinders\nat the end of the track, and, consequently, one foot before the folding\nprop, which supports the front end of the track, is knocked out by the\ncar striking a special trigger which allows this folding prop to swing\nforward when the front end of the track folds down to insure that the\naerodrome will not become entangled with the car, even though the\naerodrome be not quite up to soaring speed at the moment of\nlaunching The manner in which this front end of the track folds down\ncan be very readily seen by comparing Plate 43 with Plate 95 of\nChapter XII ◊, the former showing the front end of the track in\nhorizontal position, with [p161] the aerodrome at the extreme rear end\n\n\njust preparatory to launching, and the latter showing the front end of\nthe track folded down with the hinged prop standing outward in its\ndownward path and the aerodrome just launched These photographs\nwill be more particularly referred to later, but attention is here called\nto them so that the description immediately following may be more\neasily understood Although this method of launching the aerodrome seemed to Mr Langley, both theoretically and from the experience with the models,\nto be a satisfactory and feasible plan, there were two very important\nrespects in which it seemed from the very first open to objection In\nthe first place, it was necessary that the aerodrome should be\nlaunched as nearly at its soaring speed as possible, because either an\nexcess or deficiency of speed interfered to some extent with the\nequilibrium of the machine So many factors were involved in the\ndetermination of what this final velocity should be that it seemed\nalmost impossible to be sure of the results until at least one test of the\naerodrome had been made In the second place it was not known\nwhether the rapid acceleration of the car would seriously interfere\nwith the equilibrium of the aviator In reference to the first question it was, of course, known that a\nfreely falling body acquires a speed of 32 feet per second at the end of\nthe first second after having fallen a distance of 16 feet It was\nproposed to launch the aerodrome at approximately 35 feet per\nsecond; and, since the distance over which the car would pass in\nacquiring this speed was approximately 60 feet, the rate of\nacceleration would, of course, be less than that for a freely falling\nbody The conditions in the two cases, however, are quite different In\nthe case of the freely falling body there is the constant force of gravity\nwhich causes the acceleration In the case of the aerodrome the car is\ninitially standing still but ready to be acted upon by the combined\nforce of the thrust of the propellers and the tension of the springs The\npropeller thrust is approximately 450 pounds at the moment of\nreleasing the car, while the spring tension adds approximately 400\npounds more pull, giving a total pull of 850 pounds acting on the car\nat the start The weight of the aerodrome including the aeronaut\nbeing approximately 850 pounds, and the weight of the car being\napproximately 450 pounds, the total weight to be accelerated is 1300\n\n\npounds The resistance of the car and the aerodrome is zero at the\nmoment the car is released, and increases approximately as the square\nof the velocity until it reaches approximately 300 pounds at the\nsoaring speed of the aerodrome; while on the other hand the spring\ntension decreases uniformly from 400 pounds at the start to\napproximately 76 pounds at the end of the track, and the thrust due to\nthe propellers decreases from 450 pounds at the start to\napproximately 250 pounds at the moment of launching Consequently,\nit is in a general way clear that the rate of acceleration of the\naerodrome and car decrease, probably in a geometric ratio, the rate of\nacceleration [p162] at the moment of launching the aerodrome being\nmuch less than that of a freely falling body Since so many factors\nenter into the problem no confidence was felt in calculations as to\nwhat the rate of acceleration would be It was, therefore, decided to\ndetermine it experimentally at the same time that tests were made on\nthe car to determine what spring tension would be necessary to enable\nthe aerodrome and car to acquire soaring speed by the time they\nreached the end of the track It was obviously impossible to make this initial test with the\naerodrome mounted on the launching car, as the aerodrome would\ncertainly wreck both itself and the car were it allowed to remain\nfastened when the car was stopped at the end of the track It was,\ntherefore, decided to make the tests by mounting on the car boards\nwhich would have a head resistance equal to that of the aerodrome In\norder to minimize as much as possible the blow due to the car striking\nthe buffers at the end of the track, the car had been made as light as\npossible On this account it was felt to be unwise to risk adding to it a\nweight of 850 pounds to represent the aerodrome, and supplying an\nadditional spring tension to represent the thrust of the propellers, as\nthe total effect of the added weight and the added pull would\ncertainly completely demolish the car By calculation it was found\nthat the omission of the 850 pounds weight of the aerodrome and the\nspring tension to represent the thrust of the propellers would\npractically counterbalance each other; and that if sufficient spring\ntension were provided to cause the car, with the light boards\nrepresenting the head resistance of the aerodrome, to reach the\nsoaring speed by the time it arrived at the end of the track, it would\n\n\nbe safe to assume that this spring tension would be sufficient for use\nin launching the aerodrome The method of measuring the final speed of the launching car for\nthe models consisted in fastening a strip of smoked paper to the\nlaunching car in such a position that it was drawn past a stylus\nfastened to the end of a vibrating tuning fork placed at the end of the\ntrack This had proved perfectly successful, but it gave a record\nmerely of the final speed attained by the car at the moment of\nlaunching the aerodrome In the case of the large aerodrome it was\ndesirable to have a record of the speed of the car during the first few\nfeet, and also at several other points in its travel down the launching\ntrack, and the more numerous these points the better Short strips of\ncopper were accordingly placed every twelve inches along the length\nof the track, and these were connected by a wire to one terminal of a\nsmall electric battery Mounted on the car, in such a way that it would\nbe drawn across these contact strips, was a copper brush arranged to\nmake continuous contact with another wire stretched along the track,\nthis second wire being connected to the other terminal of the electric\nbattery and having in its circuit the magnet which actuated a pen on a\nchronograph Since the rate of revolution of the chronograph barrel\nwas known, the [p163] distance between the marks which the magnet\nwould cause the pen to make when its circuit was closed by the brush\non the car passing across the contact strips on the track would give\ncorrect measures of the time consumed by the car in passing over\neach twelve inches of its travel Upon test, however, it was found\nimpossible to get the chronograph magnets to work rapidly enough to\nrespond to the very rapid opening and closing of the circuit after the\ncar had passed over the first one-quarter of its length of travel As a\nlarge part of the slowness of action seemed to be due to the weight of\nthe fountain pens, they were replaced by small glass tubes drawn out\nto a fine point and containing a small amount of ink These seemed,\nhowever, to be still too heavy to respond to the rapid closing of the\ncircuit unless the contacts were made unduly long The contacts were\nfinally made three inches long and placed only every three feet along\nthe track, but just as these contacts were completed and placed in\nposition the clock-work of the chronograph itself became deranged Before it could be repaired, the tests were discontinued, as everything\n\n\nwas in readiness for the boat to proceed down the river where the\nactual tests in free flight were to be made Tests of the final speed of\nthe car were, however, made by the tuning-fork method, and the\nsprings were adjusted until their tension was sufficient to cause the\ncar to attain a speed of thirty-five feet a second at a point three inches\nin front of the point at which the aerodrome would be released from\nthe car ◊\n[p164]\nCHAPTER V\nCONSTRUCTION OF FRAME OF LARGE AERODROME\nThe general plan for the large aerodrome was never a matter of\nuncertainty At the time when the first general designs were made\nthere had been in the history of mankind only one type of machine,\nthat of the steam-driven Langley models, which had proved capable of\nflight for any considerable distance Furthermore, the selection of this\ntype had been the result not of sudden fancy or of purely theoretical\nconsideration, but of years of the most careful experimentation, in the\ncourse of which nearly every conceivable style of machine had been\ntested with some form of power It would have been worse than folly,\ntherefore, if the one clear path had been left to seek some unknown\nway It was fully realized from the first, however, that the increase in size\nalone would make necessary in the design for the large aerodrome a\ngreat many modifications from the designs of the steam-driven\nmodels It was not possible here, as in nearly every other kind of\nstructure, simply to magnify uniformly the parts and proportions of\nthe small machine in order to obtain a successful large one This is\nparticularly true in the case of the aerodrome, because the rapid\nincrease of weight in the larger structure is out of all proportion to the\nincrease in strength, while it is very desirable that the more expensive\nmachine which is designed to carry a human being shall be relatively\neven stronger than the easily replaced model This problem of\nincreasing size without sacrificing strength and stability, it was known\nfrom the beginning, would be encountered in a particularly difficult\nform in designing the frame of the large machine, and was to be\nsolved not by the discovery of some new and wonderfully strong\nmaterial, but by improvements both in the general plan and the\ndetails of the machine Here, as is often the case, it was not the large\nchanges in the design but the improvements in small and sometimes\nseemingly unimportant details which demanded the most careful\nconsideration and, as a whole, contributed most to the final result For\nthis reason, as well as because the large changes, when pointed out,\n\n\nare usually easily understood, the present chapter is for the most part\na description of the improvement of details From the experience gained in the construction of the frames of the\nseveral steam-driven models, it was decided that the frame for the\nlarge aerodrome must consist essentially of two principal parts First,\na rigid backbone was required, extending from the point of\nattachment of the front wings to the point of attachment of the rear\nwings; and this backbone, for convenience designated [p165] the “main\nframe,” must support the second principal part, the “transverse\nframe,” which formed a cross with the main frame, and at the ends of\nwhich the propellers were mounted While it was necessary that this\ntransverse frame should have considerable rigidity and strength in a\nvertical direction, yet its main strength and stiffness was required in\nthe horizontal plane for withstanding the thrust of the propellers It\nhad been possible to construct the frames of the later steam-driven\nmodels stiff enough, and at the same time light enough, by the use of\nproperly proportioned steel tubing, but calculation very soon showed\nthat in order to secure sufficient rigidity for the frame of the large\naerodrome and at the same time keep the weight within the\npermissible limit, it would be necessary to depend very largely on\nguy-wires and to use tubing only for forming the struts against which\nthe guy-wires should act But this obviously introduced a new series of\nproblems The extensive system of guy-wires necessary would add\nmaterially to the head resistance of the aerodrome, and this might\nconceivably be so great as to require more propulsive power than\nwould be required for a frame heavier but unincumbered by the head\nresistance of the wires It became necessary to consider these\nproblems, but no data were accessible from which the head resistance\ncould be computed with any confidence The coefficient of resistance\nfor a cylindrical body moving through the air in a direction\nperpendicular to its length may in general be taken as one-half that of\na flat body of the same cross-section; but it was thought very certain\nthat, owing to the fact that tightly stretched wires are in constant\nvibration when the aerodrome is in the air, the resistance of the wires\nmust be considerably greater than would be calculated from treating\nthem as cylinders having a coefficient of 0",

some unexpected\nresults were obtained PL 44 44 RESISTANCE OF WIRES AT GIVEN VELOCITIES ◊\n[p167]\nThese results are fairly well summarized in the following general\nstatements: First, that the coefficient of resistance increases to some\ndegree as the size of the wire is decreased; second, that in the case of\nwires of the size which it was expected to use, and at approximately\nthe soaring speed of the aerodrome, the resistance is certainly not\ngreater than 75 per cent, and more probably less than 50 per cent of\nthe resistance encountered by a flat surface of the same projected\narea; third, that the coefficient of resistance did not seem to be\nincreased by the vibration of the wires On the contrary, it was noted\nduring the experiments that when they reached a speed which just\n\n\ncaused them to “sing,” there was a marked diminution in the\nresistance This statement is made, however, with some reserve, for it\nis probable that the singing of the wires was due to vibration in the\nhorizontal plane, and it is not definitely known what the effect would\nbe of vibration in the vertical plane To make the very extensive experiments necessary to determine\nthese propositions conclusively would have required much more time\nthan could at this period be spared from the actual constructional\nwork on the aerodrome Nevertheless, the data did seem to indicate\nthat it was at least not unwise to employ the extensive system of\nguying which had been planned in order to give the necessary\nstrength to the frame of the large aerodrome This plan of\nconstruction was, therefore, definitely adopted, and as a result of later\nexperience the system of guying was still further extended As the transverse frame had to be made comparatively rigid in\norder to prevent undue binding of the bearings of the transmission\nand propeller shafts, it was necessary to make it intrinsically stronger\nand, therefore, heavier in proportion to its size than the main frame The main frame, although requiring great strength to enable it to\nwithstand the strains, both torsional and direct, which were imposed\nupon it by the weights which it supported, did not need excessive\nrigidity, and could, indeed, be distorted an appreciable amount\nwithout danger of any serious effect on the action of the wings or\nrudder; but even a small amount of distortion in the transverse frame\nmight easily cause such friction at the bearings of the shafts as to\nabsorb fifty per cent or more of the engine power In the photographs, Plates 45 to 48, which show the actual\ncondition of the frame on January 31 and February 1, 1900, the\nletters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I designate parts of the main frame, A\nand H being the rear and front midrods, respectively,

midrods to the port\nand starboard tubes R is the front main tube of the transverse frame,\nthe rear main tube being exactly similar, and both being connected to\nthe main tubes of the main frame where they cross them The ends of\nthe main tubes of the [p168] transverse frame are joined together by\n\n\nthe “bed plates” L, which are of I-beam section, and have mounted on\ntheir outer faces the bearings which support the propeller shafts At V\nare bevel gears mounted on the propeller shafts, which are driven by\nco-acting bevel gears, M, mounted on the outer ends of the\ntransmission shafts, O, the latter being at this point firmly supported\nin bearings mounted on the inner faces of the bed plates and steadied\nby the intermediate bearings, N The two transmission shafts are seen\nto be not in line, the rotary cylinder engine that was then under\nconstruction requiring this arrangement The bed plates, L, are further\nstiffened by the brace tubes, K, and the transverse frame is braced\nagainst the thrust of the propellers by the tubes J The four tubes, P,\nunite at their upper ends to form what was designated as the upper\n“pyramid,” and the wires, S and T, radiate from its apex to the rear\nand front, respectively, of the main frame The lower “pyramid,” on\nthe under side of the frame, also has similar wires running fore and\naft The main portions of both frames are further strengthened by\ntheir sub-frames, which merge together, and the main tubes of the\nmain frame are individually stiffened in the vertical plane by a minor\nsystem of guying The scales shown in the photographs are calibrated\nin metres It is to be particularly noted that the midrod, which had heretofore\nformed the backbone of the main frame, was now made to act merely\nas a means of attaching the wings to the frame, the main strength of\nthe frame being furnished by the two parallel fifty millimetre tubes\nwhich extended the entire length of the frame and which, reinforced\nby the guy-wires, formed a truss not only more rigid transversely, but\nalso many times stronger in its ability to resist torsional strains than\ncould be secured by a single tube of equal weight In this plan of\nconstructing the main frame, the pyramids constituted a very\nimportant element, for with the guy-wires arranged as they were it\nwas impossible for any portion of the frame to experience a stress\nwhich was not transmitted in some way to the pyramids In the frame,\nas here shown, these pyramids were formed of tubes 15 mm in\ndiameter, 0 5 mm thick, stiffened against buckling under the end\npressure by means of the cross-braces, which united them near their\nmidpoints While the sole function of the upper pyramid was to serve\nin the system of guying the frame, the lower pyramid not only served\n\n\na similar purpose, but also provided a means for holding the\naerodrome to the launching car in the process of launching it, the\nclutch-hooks gripping around the short horizontal tube at the apex of\nthe pyramid and thus drawing the “bearing points” of the machine\nfirmly against the uprights on the car In fact, the particular\narrangement of these pyramids was largely determined by this\nnecessity for providing means for holding the aerodrome to the\nlaunching car, and the form which seemed best suited to the purpose\nwas duplicated on the upper side of the frame

the frame will be\nmore clearly seen in later photographs, where it will be noted that\nthey were made use of in the more elaborate system of guying which\nwas adopted While, in general, the frame at this time seemed to be reasonably\nstiff and strong, yet it was subjected to a very thorough test by\nsupporting it at different points and suspending from it weights to\nrepresent the various parts, such as engine, aviator, wings, rudder and\nso forth, the deflections which were produced by these weights being\ncarefully noted It was further tested by subjecting it to vibratory\n\n\nstrains, such as it would be likely to meet in actual use After this the\nwhole frame was tested against torsional strains, such as would be\ncaused by the wind twisting one set of wings more than the other As\na result of these tests it was decided that the frame should be\nstrengthened as far as it was possible to do so without greatly\nincreasing the weight, which even now was found to be rapidly\nincreasing beyond what had been calculated as permissible The main\nguy-wires were replaced by heavier and stronger ones, and while\nthese were found to add somewhat to the stiffness of the frame, yet\nsomething more seemed necessary to insure safety The delay in securing the engine, which had been contracted for\nwith a guarantee that it would be delivered in February, 1899, had\nbecome so serious and had delayed the completion of the frame to\nsuch an extent that the question of building an exact duplicate of the\nlarge machine, but of one-quarter its linear dimensions was being\ncarefully considered at this time, and it was decided to make no\nfurther changes in the guying of the large frame until after the small\none was built On account of its smaller size changes could be more\nreadily and cheaply made on it, and the advantages of different\nmethods of guying could be just as well studied Later, when this was\ncompleted, it was found that, with the same system of guying that had\nbeen used in the larger frame, the model was so very stiff that it did\nnot require any further strengthening, the smaller scale, of course,\naccounting for the difference What was thought to be the best system\nto follow in strengthening the frame of the large machine was,\nhowever, first tried on the smaller one, and it was found that for a\nvery slight increase in weight a very great increase in strength could\nbe obtained This change in the system of guying consisted essentially\nof building a “trestle” of tubing at a point on the upper side, midway\nbetween the pyramid and the rear end of the frame One of the former\nsets of guy-wires which passed to the rear of the frame was then\nreplaced by a set which started at the foot of the rear tubes of the\nupper pyramid, passed over and was fastened to the trestle, and from\nthere passed to the rear end of the frame at the points where the\nlonger guy-wires from the pyramid had formerly been attached The\n[p170] guy-wires on the lower side of the frame, at the rear, were\ncorrespondingly changed so that the upper and lower systems should\n\n\nbe similar, the wires which started from the main tubes at the foot of\nthe pyramid passing to the bearing points, and from there to the rear\nend of the frame In order to keep the main frame of the large aerodrome as short as\npossible, it had originally been planned to make the distance between\nthe center of pressure of the front wings and the center of pressure of\nthe rear equal to five metres When these same proportions were\nfollowed in the quarter-size model, it was found that it brought the\nrear wings so close to the propellers that their lifting effect was\ncertain to be interfered with by the blast of air created by the slip of\nthe propellers It was therefore decided that all things considered it\nwould be best to increase this distance between the wings, even\nthough this involved an increase in weight, partly on account of the\nincreased amount of tubing, and still more on account of the guy-\nwires which it would be necessary to add in order to make up for the\nweakness due to increased length The large aerodrome frame was\naccordingly lengthened 2 5 feet (76 2 cm ), and the guy-wire system\nwas changed to that clearly shown by the photographs of July 10,\n1902, Plates 49, 50 and 51, the black cross-lines on the background\nbeing 50 centimetres apart From an inspection of these photographs\nit will be seen that two sets of guy-wires were carried from the upper\nand lower pyramids, respectively, towards the rear of the frame, the\nfirst set being carried to the main tubes at the foot of the “trestle” and\nthe bearing points, and the second set to these same main tubes at the\nsecond cross-tube The sets of wires which started from the feet of the\npyramids were carried over the “trestle” on the upper side and the\nbearing points on the lower side, and both joined to the main tubes at\nthe rear cross-tube Additional cross-guy-wires for stiffening the frame\nsideways were added in each of the squares formed by the junction of\nthe cross-tubes with the main tubes A secondary system of truss guy-\nwires running over short guy-posts attached to the tubes of the main\nframe also contributed to the strength and rigidity of the whole Although the pyramids had shown no signs of weakness,\nnevertheless, because of increased strains due to the lengthening of\nthe main frame, it was thought advisable to make them stronger Instead of the 15-mm tubing, which had formerly been used, 25-mm tubing of the same thickness was therefore substituted, and additional\n\n\ncross-braces were added, as will be seen from the photographs, and\nfrom the scale drawings in Plates 52, 53 and 54, which show the\naerodrome as it was when completed The numerals attached to these\ndrawings refer to the detail drawings shown in later plates PL 49 GUY-WIRE SYSTEM, JULY 10, 1902 ◊\nPL 50

many other parts, notably the wings, propellers\nand rudder, it was necessary to use a large number of turn-buckles As\nalmost every wire [p171] required at least one, and in some cases two\nturn-buckles, the weight represented by this single item rapidly\nbecame so formidable as to require serious attention In the\nconstruction of the models, it had been necessary to employ some\nspecial turn-buckles in connecting the guy-wires of the wings to their\nguy-posts in order to secure the minute adjustment of the wires\nnecessary to prevent the wings from being warped and distorted by\nunequal and improper adjustment These turn-buckles had been made\nin the Institution shops, as the very lightest ones which could be\nsecured in the market were from ten to twenty times as heavy as it\nwas necessary for them to be to provide ample strength In the\nconstruction of the large aerodrome, however, the large number\nrequired, and the desire to complete the machine at the earliest\n\n\nmoment, made it advisable to procure the turn-buckles, if possible,\nfrom outside sources, and a very careful search was accordingly made\namong the various dealers After much delay some bronze turn-\nbuckles were secured which were very much stronger for their weight\nthan any others on the market, but upon testing them it was found\nthat while they weighed 45 grammes, their average breaking strength\nwas only 593 pounds Previous experience had shown that turn-\nbuckles which would not break under a less load than 750 pounds\ncould certainly be made to weigh not more than 18 grammes As even\nat this time it was realized that at least 100 turn-buckles would be\nnecessary for the entire machine, the excess weight which the heavy\nturn-buckles would add was felt to be absolutely prohibitory, and the\nconstruction of steel turn-buckles was immediately begun in the\nInstitution shops These turn-buckles were at first made in several\nsizes, and while some few were at first made “double ended,” most of\nthem were threaded at only one end, the other end being provided\nwith a swivel-hook, or eye They were at first made of mild steel, the\nswivel-hooks, in fact, being made of wire nails in order to utilize the\nhead of the nail as a shoulder without the expense of machining rod\nsteel of a size large enough to form the shoulder It was found,\nhowever, that the weak point of this type of turn-buckle was the\nswivel end, and most of those which were then on hand were made\ndouble ended by removing the hook, tapping a left-hand thread into\nthis end of the shank, and fitting a threaded eye-socket in it The guy-\nwires themselves were attached to the eyes of the turn-buckles and to\nthe fittings on the frame by twisting loops at the ends of the wires,\nand although the very greatest difference in the strength of a\ncompleted guy-wire may result from the way in which the loops are\ntwisted, yet, after much training, the workmen were taught to twist\nthese very uniformly, following the plan which can be best\nunderstood by an inspection of the drawings in Plate 55 which show\nthe loops more clearly than they can be described After the loops had\nbeen properly twisted, soft solder was run all through the twist in\norder to unite firmly the twists of the wire Although special grades of\nwire were found which showed very high tensile strength when the\nwire was [p172] tested without having loops formed in its ends, yet it\nappeared that the twisting of these high-grade wires so seriously\n\n\naffected them that in the case of guy-wires with loops at the ends,\nbetter final results could be obtained by using softer grades of steel The wire which was actually found best, after much experiment, was\na good grade of Bessemer steel of a medium hardness, which had been\n“coppered” to prevent rusting However, even with the softer grades\nof steel wire, it was found that there were sometimes hard spots in the\nwire which revealed themselves only upon test, and that when a hard\nspot occurred in the twisted portion where the loop was formed, the\nfinal strength of the completed guy-wire was sometimes only twenty-\nfive per cent of what it should be The precaution was then taken to\nsubject each of the completed guys to a test strain at least twenty-five\nper cent greater than it was calculated the wire would have to stand\nin actual use, so that no accident from defective wires would be likely\nto occur Later on, however, much trouble was caused by the loops in the\nends of some of the guy-wires slipping, owing to the giving way of the\nsolder which had been run through the joint, the amount of slipping,\nwhile small, being sufficient to alter completely the relative stresses\non the various wires, thus causing distortion of the framework itself In order to avoid this difficulty a new method was devised of\nattaching the guy-wires to the turn-buckles and to the fittings by\nwhich they were carried to the frame This method consisted in\nthreading the ends of the guy-wires so that they could be inserted\ndirectly in the threaded ends of the turn-buckles The wires when\nconnected in this way to the turn-buckles showed absolutely no slip,\nand the entire system gained greatly in strength thereby The only\ndisadvantage which was found in this new method of attaching the\nguy-wires to their fittings, was that if the wire was bent very close to\nthe fitting, it would break in the screw thread very easily But since\nmost of the guy-wires when once attached to the machine are always\ntight, and in fact, under more or less strain, there was in most cases\nno likelihood of the wires being endangered by being bent close to the\nfittings Since the screw threads, which it was necessary to adopt in\nthis new plan of connecting the guy-wires, had to be very much finer\nthan the threads which had been used in the turn-buckles previously\nconstructed, it was necessary to make new turn-buckles, the others\nbeing too thin to permit of their being bored out, bushed and re-\n\n\nthreaded The new turn-buckles were made of a much higher grade of\nsteel, and probably represent very nearly the maximum of strength for\nthe minimum of weight possible without the use of some of the very\nmuch higher-grade steels which have recently come on the market,\nbut which are exceedingly expensive to work By means of this\nimproved plan of attaching the wires,42 it [p173] was found possible to\ngain practically fifty per cent in the strength of the entire system of\nguy-wires used on the frame Many small changes were from time to time made in the various\nsmall fittings by which the guy-wires were attached to the frame,\nnearly all of these fittings having been originally made of a very mild\ngrade of steel owing to the fact that it was so very much easier to\nwork At the time these fittings were made it was constantly expected\nthat a trial of the aerodrome would be possible very soon, and it\nseemed necessary to expedite the work as much as possible and avoid\nthe delay involved in using grades of steel that would have been\nmaterially harder to work As is always the case in work of this kind,\nretrospect shows many instances where what was supposed to be a\nshort cut to results actually proved to be the longest path, but the\nwork as a whole was remarkably free from imperfect parts which\nnecessitated reconstruction In the construction of the frames of the models it had been\ncustomary to fit the tubing accurately at the joints and to join it\npermanently together by brazing, as this was not only the lightest\nform of joint that could be made, but also the most expeditious\nmethod consistent with securing a strength of the joint comparable\nwith that of the tubing itself The construction of the frame by this\nmethod of brazing the joints together permanently, offered, however,\nseveral serious drawbacks: among them, that when a tube got injured\nit was a considerable task to replace it, while the brazing of the new\ntube in place required extreme care to prevent the frame from being\nwarped when completed, as the tube became longer while very hot\nand contracted after the joint had set Furthermore, the great heat\nrequired destroyed to a considerable degree the desirable qualities\ndue to the tube being “cold drawn,” a reduction of strength of\nsomething like 25 per cent being almost inevitable, even when the\nbrazing was most carefully done It was, therefore, decided that in the\n\n\nconstruction of the large machine all of the main joints should be\nmade by a system of “thimbles,” and it was planned at first to make\nthese thimbles by brazing short pieces of steel tubing into the proper\nshapes and angles so that they would accurately fit the tubes which\nwere to be joined The construction of the thimbles in this manner,\nhowever, seemed to involve an excessive amount of work; and, as it\nwas found that very thin castings of aluminum-bronze could be\nobtained, which would show a tensile strength very nearly as great as\nsteel, it was decided to make up patterns for the thimbles and cast\nthem of aluminum-bronze The aluminum-bronze castings were obtained and properly\nmachined to fit the tubes, but when it was attempted to “tin” the\ninterior walls of the thimbles it was found that the solder could not be\nmade to stick to the bronze As a considerable amount of work had\nbeen expended on the machine work of these thimbles much time and\neffort was spent in attempting to devise “fluxes” [p174] and solders\nwhich could be made to work with the aluminum-bronze, but the final\nresult was that the aluminum-bronze thimbles had to be abandoned They were replaced by similar castings of gun-metal of a slightly\nheavier section, which at the time were thought to be very suitable for\nthe purpose But, in finally assembling the frame after the changes described\nabove had been made, steel thimbles, built up of short pieces of\ntubing, as had originally been planned, were substituted for the gun-\nmetal thimbles This change was made not only because of the great\nincrease in strength, but more particularly because many of the gun-\nmetal fittings had been imperfectly constructed, so that it was\nextremely difficult to align the frame The steel thimbles, which were\nmade in the Institution shops proved thoroughly satisfactory and gave\nno trouble of any kind Many of these thimbles and the method of\nattaching the guy-wire fittings to them are shown in Plates 56 and 57,\nas well as in Plate 55 TRANSVERSE\nFRAME\nIt will be recalled from the description of the models Nos 5 and 6,\nin Part I, that the position of the line of thrust, with respect to the\npositions of the center of pressure and center of gravity in the vertical\n\n\nplane was, theoretically, very much better in No 6 than in No 5",
    "5 In\ndesigning the large aerodrome, it was desired to reproduce as nearly\nas possible the relative position of the line of thrust with reference to\nthe center of pressure and center of gravity which existed in No 6,\nbut for constructional reasons it was found impossible to do so In fact\nit appeared that without seriously complicating the construction of\nthe frame it was impossible to raise the line of thrust with respect to\nthe center of gravity materially higher than it was in No In fact\nit appeared that without seriously complicating the construction of\nthe frame it was impossible to raise the line of thrust with respect to\nthe center of gravity materially higher than it was in No 5 In No In No 6\nthe line of thrust was 12 centimetres above the midrod, this being\neffected by placing the engines some distance from the boiler, and at\nthe extreme ends of the transverse frame where they were connected\ndirectly to the propellers In the case of the steam engine the weight\nof the engine proper is a relatively small portion of the entire weight\nof the power plant, and it is, therefore, possible to put the engine\nalmost anywhere without materially affecting the center of gravity But where a gas engine is used the engine itself constitutes the greater\npart of the weight of the power plant, and any raising of the engine,\ntherefore, materially raises the center of gravity of the whole\nmachine The line of thrust in the large aerodrome was, therefore,\npractically in the plane of the main frame, and consequently very\nlittle higher than the center of gravity PL 55 FRAME FITTINGS AND GUY-WIRE ATTACHMENTS, ETC",

ATTACHMENTS, ETC ◊ lgr\nThe use of one engine to drive two propellers mounted at opposite\nends of the transverse frame, and in a direction perpendicular to the\ncrank shaft of the engine, necessitates the use of a pair of bevel gears\nbetween each of the propeller shafts and the shafts by which the\npower is conveyed to them from [p175] the engine shaft Since the\nefficient transmission of power through bevel gears requires that they\nbe very accurately placed with reference to each other, and\n\n\nmaintained very accurately in this position while they are at work, it\nwas necessary to make the transverse frame very rigid, especially at\nits extreme ends This was accomplished by the use of what were\ncalled “propeller-shaft bed plates ” They are designated by the\nnumeral 27 in Plate 54, and are shown in detail in Plate 58 as of a\nvery deep I-beam section, having very narrow flanges top and bottom,\nthe web of the I-beam furnishing the strength in a vertical direction,\nwhile sufficient stiffness laterally was obtained from the flanges,\nassisted by the brace tubes, which acted as struts between the bed\nplates and the main tubes of the transverse frame These struts, while\nvery light, added enormously not only to the lateral stiffness of the\npropeller bed plates, but furnished for a minimum weight a maximum\nprevention against twisting of the plates The propeller-shaft bed\nplates were originally planned to be made of sheet metal with the\nflanges brazed to the web But at the time that they were constructed\nthe pressure of the work was so great in the Institution shops that it\nwas found necessary to have some of the work done outside, and the\nparties who undertook the construction of these bed plates were\nunwilling to attempt to braze them up, and accordingly worked them\nfrom steel forgings made for the purpose The expense of this plan of\nconstruction proved large and unnecessary, as both previous and later\nexperience proved that it was not only practicable to braze up bed\nplates more complicated in their design than these, but that equal\nstrength for equal weight could thus be obtained for less than one-\nquarter the cost of constructing them from solid forgings Furthermore, where such parts are made from the solid, changes\nwhich later tests prove advisable can frequently not be carried out\nwithout very serious cost and delay, while with the bed plates formed\nby brazing less hesitancy is felt in removing parts which are brazed\nthereto and substituting new parts, or even discarding the bed plates\naltogether and substituting new ones Particular emphasis is laid on\nthis point for the reason that much expense and delay would have\nbeen avoided had these very expensive propeller-shaft bed plates been\ndiscarded as early as 1901 and replaced by others which would have\npermitted a considerable strengthening of the ball-bearings, which,\nwhile strong enough to stand even more power than they were\noriginally designed for, were far too weak to be safe when working\n\n\nunder the greatly increased stress due to the very much higher engine\npower which was later used Instead of discarding these bed plates\nthen for new ones, they were strengthened by brazing to them\ncrescent-shaped pieces, as shown in the drawings and photographs This strengthening was made necessary by the larger hole cut in the\nbed plates for the larger bevel gears The bed plates for the engine,\nwhich are later described, besides other bed plates which were made\nfor other purposes, were all [p176] formed by the use of sheet metal\nand tubing properly brazed together, and none of them ever gave any\ntrouble In the early photographs of the aerodrome frame, especially that of\nJanuary 31, 1900, Plate 45, it will be noted that the two transmission\nshafts, which extend from the propeller-shaft bed plates towards the\ncenter, are not in line, the port transmission shaft being at the center\nof the transverse frame, while the starboard shaft is three inches to\none side This arrangement was necessary in order to connect the\nshafts to the rotary cylinder engine which was being constructed\nunder contract, and which was almost momentarily expected for more\nthan a year after its original promise of delivery on February 28,\n1899 Later, when this engine was finally found to be a failure, and\nthe writer constructed the engine in the Institution shops, the\nstarboard transmission shaft was moved over to the center line and\nthe crank shaft of the engine, which was carried through on the center\nline of the transverse frame, was then connected directly to the inner\nends of the transmission shafts These shafts, as well as the propeller shafts, were originally\nconstructed of steel tubing 1 5 inches in diameter and\n1\n16\nof an inch thick, but on account of the increased power of the large\nengine it was found necessary to increase the thickness of the shafts to\n1\n8\nof an inch Difficulty was also found with the tubing of which the\nshafts were made This, though not exactly straight when received\nfrom the factory, could be pretty accurately straightened in the lathe\nby exercising proper care, but the moment any real strain was put\nupon it in the transmission of power, it again went out of shape and\ncaused serious damage to the bearings by whirling, buckling, and so\n\n\nforth As the skin of the tubing is really the strongest part, owing to\nthe cold-drawing process to which it has been subjected, great care\nwas taken to secure shafts which were sufficiently straight for use\nwithout machining, but it was finally found impossible to rely on the\nunmachined shafts, and all the later shafts for the aerodrome were\nmade by getting tubing a sixty-fourth of an inch thicker than was\ncalculated to be necessary and turning off this extra metal in a lathe",

but,\nfor convenience in assembling, the flanges by which the main\ntransmission shafts were connected to the crank shaft of the engine\nwere at first fastened to the shafts by screw-threads, the threads being\nin the proper direction to cause the flanges to jam against the\nshoulders of the shafts when the engine turned in its normal direction This method of fastening, however, caused serious trouble, owing to\nthe flanges jamming so tight that it became impossible to unscrew\nthem after they had once been used in driving the propellers The\nusual provisions of keys and key-ways adopted in general engineering\npractice, where solid shafts are employed, were, of course, out of the\nquestion, since the shaft would have to be greatly increased in\nthickness throughout its entire length [p177] merely to provide the\nextra metal at the small place in which the key-ways were formed Taper pins either sheared off or very soon stretched the holes so badly\nas to leave the parts loose, and were otherwise very unsatisfactory The method finally adopted, which proved very successful, was that of\nforming integral with the couplings shallow internal tongues and\ngrooves which fitted corresponding tongues and grooves either in the\nexterior surface of the shafts or in collars brazed to them at the proper\npoint The form of flange coupling, in which bolts draw the two\nflanges tightly together, was also a source of considerable trouble and\ndelay, which was finally overcome by forming shallow tongues and\ngrooves in the faces of the flanges, the tongues taking up the torsion\nand relieving the bolts which held the flanges together of all strain\nexcept one of slight tension The same difficulties experienced in\nmounting the couplings on the shafts were met with in connection\nwith the gears, both on the propeller and transmission shafts, and\nwere finally obviated in a manner similar to that described above The bevel gears originally constructed for transmitting the power\nfrom the transmission shafts to the propeller shafts, were made of\ncase-hardened steel and were eight-pitch, twenty-five teeth, with\nthree-quarter inch width of face The gears were very accurately\nplaned to give as perfect a form of tooth as possible, in order to avoid\n\n\nloss of power in transmission, and although the manufacturer who cut\nthe teeth on them asserted at the time they were made that they\nwould not be capable of transmitting more than five horse-power, yet\nthey actually did transmit considerably more than twelve horse-power\non each set; but they were not strong enough to transmit the full\npower of the large engine which was finally used The gears that were\nfinally used were similarly constructed of mild steel which was case\nhardened\n1\n64\nof an inch deep after they were finished, there being thirty-one teeth\nin the gear on the transmission shaft and forty teeth in the one on the\npropeller shaft, the teeth being eight-pitch, three-quarters of an inch\nface These light gears proved amply strong, and several times stood\nthe strain which they accidentally received when one of the propellers\nbroke while the engine was under full power, and thus threw the\nentire fifty horse-power over on the other propeller, which was\nconsequently driven at a greatly increased speed Plain bronze bearings had been used throughout on the model\naerodromes, but in the construction of the large aerodrome ball-\nbearings were used on all of the propeller and transmission shafts, not\nonly on account of the decreased loss through friction, but also\nbecause ball-bearings can be built much lighter than solid bronze\nones, and, furthermore, do not present such great difficulties in\nlubrication However, owing to the limited size which it was possible\nto secure for these bearings, because of their having been originally\ndesigned for only twenty-four horse-power, and without any margin\nfor a later increase of the [p178] space in which they had to be applied,\nthey were never really large enough for the work they had to do when\ntransmitting the full power of the large engine They gave continual\ntrouble, and were the source of delay which, while it cannot be\naccurately measured, since there were often other causes, yet might\nbe conservatively estimated at not less than three or four months Such a delay, when reckoned in retrospect, can easily be seen to have\ncaused an expense which would have sufficed for almost any change\nin the bearings, bed plates, etc , had the change been made\nimmediately after the bearings were found to give trouble With the\nbetter steel which it is now possible to obtain for the races of the\n\n\nbearings, and with the high-grade balls now obtainable, the bearings\ncould be readily replaced without changing any other parts and still\nbe amply strong for the work PROPELLERS\nBoth the tests on the whirling-table and the actual results with the\nmodels had shown that propellers which were true helices formed out\nof wood were rather more efficient than those constructed by the use\nof a hub in which were inserted wooden arms, forming a framing over\nwhich cloth was tightly drawn But the very great difference in the\ncost of construction and the facility with which the latter type could\nbe repaired in case of damage—the wooden ones were practically of\nno use if once they were much injured-—made it seem advisable to\nconstruct all the propellers for the large aerodrome in the manner just\nexplained Several pair of small propellers had been built on this plan,\nsome as early as 1895, and one very important advantage had been\nfound to be possessed by this type besides cheapness and facility of\nrepair Wooden propellers of even so small a diameter as one metre\nhad been found to suffer a quite appreciable bending of the blades,\ndue to the thrust produced by them, even though the blades had been\nmade of considerable thickness In planning a propeller 2 5 metres in\ndiameter for the large aerodrome it was seen that in order to make the\nblade sufficiently strong to withstand its own thrust it would be\nnecessary to make it inordinately thick, which, of course, would mean\na considerable increase in weight In fact, it was seen that the weight\nof the larger propellers would increase practically as the cube of the\ndiameter; which, for the 2 5-metre propeller, would involve a weight\nof something over fifteen times the weight of those one metre in\ndiameter The other type, which for convenience we will call “canvas\ncovered,” permitted the bending moment produced on the blade by\nthe thrust to be taken up by guy-wires running from the corners of the\nblades to a central post projecting from the hub of the propeller, and\nit was found that in this way a considerable saving in weight could be\neffected [p179]\nIn November, 1897, in order to obtain by actual test some data on\npropellers, such as it was planned to use on the large aerodrome in\ncase it was later built, it was decided to construct one propeller 2 5\n\n\nmetres in diameter and 1 25-pitch ratio with two blades, each\ncovering the sector of 36 degrees on the projected circle About this\nsame time an engine builder, who some years before had made some\nexperimental model engines in the Institution shops, proposed to\nconstruct a gasoline engine for the proposed large aerodrome As past\nexperience, not only with such engines but with all other forms of\nexplosive motors, had not been very reassuring it was thought best to\nmake brake tests of one of the heavier engines which he was at this\ntime building, and at the same time make tests with one of these large\npropellers A first series of tests was made at several different speeds,\nand then a second series was made with the engine driving the\npropeller at the same speeds The engine varied so much, however, in\nthe power developed at any speed that the data obtained were of little\nvalue As it was also desired to learn just how much thrust could be\nobtained from these propellers, when driven by a given horse-power,\na special hand car was fitted up to carry the engine, which was\nconnected to a shaft on which the propeller was mounted The\npropeller was raised above the floor of the car and projected over the\nrear end of it so as to be as little disturbed as possible by the\ndeflection of the air currents caused by the car This car, with the\nengine and propeller, was tested on a track near Mount Holly, N",
    "This car, with the\nengine and propeller, was tested on a track near Mount Holly, N J , in\nNovember, 1897, but the results were very unsatisfactory In the first\nplace, the car with the engine mounted on it was so very heavy and\noffered such a strong tractive resistance that very little speed of\npropulsion could be obtained In the second place, the engine, which\nwas said to have furnished over six horse-power on Prony-brake tests,\nevidently did not furnish anything like this amount of power at this\ntime And in the third place, the propeller was evidently far too large\nto permit the engine to run at the speed at which it would develop a\nreasonable amount of power unless some reduction gearing were\ninterposed between it and the propeller As the tests, for various\nreasons, had to be made at a great distance from Washington, and the\nsupervision of them had to be entrusted by Mr Langley to others, who\neither did not understand or appreciate the value of obtaining\naccurate data, it was found impracticable to continue them The large propeller used in these tests was built without special\nregard to weight, since it was expected that it would be subjected to\n\n\nrather rough usage under the very sudden strains produced by the\nirregular working of the gas engine Its hub was made of brass tubing,\nthe horns being brazed to rings which were slid over a central tube,\nthe rings being finally soldered to the tube after the arms had been\nadjusted to the positions which would give the blade the correct shape\nand dimensions The wooden arms were 1 5 inches in [p180] diameter\nat the hub end, tapering to 1 25 inches at the end of the blade The\nblade was exceedingly stiff as regards pressure produced by thrust,\nbut it was found to be considerably strengthened and made very much\nsafer when guy-wires were added, in the manner explained above This general type of construction was adhered to in all the future\npropellers for the aerodrome, though slight modifications, both as to\nthe size of the arms and the number and position of the cross-pieces\nwhich formed the framing of the blade, were adopted from time to\ntime A pair of heavy propellers, 2 5 metre, 1 25-pitch ratio, 36-\ndegree blade, the hubs of which were formed of brass castings, was,\nhowever, constructed for experimental purposes, where weight was\nnot an important factor When these propellers were designed, the calculations as to their\nsize and the horse-power which would be required to drive them at a\ncertain speed were based on the very incomplete data obtained from\nthe various propeller tests conducted during the preceding years When later calculations were made for them, on the data obtained in\nthe more accurate tests made in the summer of 1898, it was found\nthat the power of the engines with which it was proposed to equip the\naerodrome would not be sufficient to drive the propellers at anything\nlike the speed which the former calculations had shown would be\npossible; and that, therefore, either the ratio of the gearing between\nthe propellers and the engine would have to be changed so as to\npermit the engine to run at a very much higher speed than the\npropellers, or that propellers, having either less pitch or a smaller\ndiameter, and possibly both, would have to be substituted for these\nlarger ones Since it was easier to change the propellers then to change the\ngearing, a new set of propellers was designed which were of 2 metres\ndiameter, with a pitch ratio of unity, and with a width of blade of\nonly 30 degrees It was calculated that 20 horse-power would drive\n\n\nthese two propellers at a speed of 640 R P M",
    "M , when the aerodrome\nwas flying at a speed of 35 feet per second and the propellers were\nslipping about 50 per cent, this being found to be about the speed at\nwhich the engines might be expected to develop their maximum\npower As the larger propellers having the brass hubs were thought to\nbe excessively heavy, the hubs weighing 10 25 pounds each, and as\nany change either in size, pitch, or width of blade necessitated a new\nset of patterns in case the hubs were cast, it was decided to construct\nthe new hubs of steel tubing The weight was further reduced by\ndecreasing the size of the wooden arms to\n1\n1\n4\ninch in diameter at the hub, tapering to 1 inch at the end of the blade After the engine builder in New York had been unable to fulfil his\ncontract on the engine, and it had been condemned, propeller tests\nwere made with the experimental engine built in the Institution shops These tests showed: First, that the results which might be expected\nfrom larger propellers could be very safely predicted by extrapolation\nfrom the results of the propeller tests of 1898; [p181] and, second, that\nin order to get a thrust which would equal fifty per cent of the flying\nweight of the aerodrome it would be necessary to use propellers larger\nthan two metres in diameter unless a very large surplus of power were\nprovided It was accordingly decided to make a set of propellers\nintermediate between the two-metre, unit-pitch ratio, thirty-degree\nblade ones, and the original ones which were two and one-half\nmetres, one and one-quarter-pitch ratio, thirty-six-degree blade A set\nwas, therefore, designed two and one-half metres in diameter, unit-\npitch ratio, and thirty-degree width of blade, the hubs being made of\nsteel tubing brazed up in the same manner as the two-metre ones, and\nthe wooden arms of the blades being one and three-eighths inches in\ndiameter at the hub end, and tapering to one inch at the end of the\nblade Later, when the larger engine was actually tested in the frame, the\ninability of the original transmission and propeller shafts to stand the\nextra strain caused by the engine starting up very suddenly at times,\ntogether with the unsatisfactoriness of the screw-thread method of\nfastening the gears and couplings to the shafts made it necessary to\n\n\nprovide new shafts, gears, couplings, etc It was then decided to\nchange the ratio of gearing between the engine and the propellers,\nwhich had been one to one, so that the engine might run faster and,\ntherefore, permit the use of larger propellers For constructional\nreasons the ratio chosen was thirty-one to forty, thus making the\nengine run approximately one-third faster than the propellers In the various tests made of the engine working in the frame there\nwere two or three instances in which the propellers were damaged\neither by the sudden starting of the engine or by their not being able\nto stand the strain to which they were subjected by the power\nabsorbed, but in every case such breakages were found to be due to\nimperfections of the brazing in the joints While, therefore, it would\nhave been desirable to make the propellers somewhat heavier, yet\nsince the total weight of the aerodrome had been growing so very\nrapidly, it was felt that this need not be done, as a pair of propellers\nwhich had stood quite severe service in shop tests might reasonably\nbe expected to stand the strain of actually propelling the aerodrome\nthrough the air Nevertheless, when in the summer of 1903 the actual trials of the\nlarge aerodrome were started, it was found that the very important\ndifference between a propeller working in a closed room and one\nworking in the open air had not been given due consideration Several\nsets of propellers, 2 5 metres in diameter, unit-pitch ratio, 30-degree\nblade had been constructed and were on hand, in order that no delays\nmight be caused through a lack of such extra parts On September 9,\n1903, when the aerodrome frame without the wings was mounted on\nthe launching car on top of the boat for some trial runs with the\nengine to make sure that everything was again in readiness, before the\nengine had made 500 revolutions, the port propeller broke; and a few\nminutes [p182] later, when a new propeller had been substituted for\nthis and the engine was again started up, the starboard propeller also\nbroke When, upon further trials and replacements of propellers, all\nhad been so thoroughly demolished that there was not a complete set\nremaining, it was seen very clearly that the strains produced on a\npropeller working in the open air are very much greater than those\nproduced in shop tests, where the air is necessarily quiet These open-\nair tests of the propellers had demonstrated that their weakest point\n\n\nwas where the steel tubes which received the wooden arms of the\nblade terminated, and that another, though not so serious, point of\nweakness was where the steel arms were brazed to the central hub,\nthe thin metal tending to tear loose even before the brazed joint\nwould give way It was, therefore, decided to construct immediately a\nnew set of propellers in which the steel arms should be made of much\nheavier tubing, that is, a sixteenth of an inch thick at the end where it\nwas brazed to the central hub, and tapering in thickness to one-thirty-\nsecond of an inch at the other end These arms were further made\ntwelve inches long in place of being only three inches long as before This added length carried the steel out beyond the point where the\nfirst section brace joined the three arms together, and where they\nwere further strengthened by having the cloth covering tightly\nstretched around them In order to utilize such of the hubs of the\nformer propellers as had not been seriously damaged when the\npropellers broke, it was also decided to try the effect of merely adding\nan extra length of tube to the short arms by means of a thimble\nslipped over and brazed to the two parts, which would make these\narms twelve inches long The construction of these propellers was\npushed as rapidly as possible; and after their completion no further\ntrouble was at any later time caused by insufficient strength of the\npropellers Even in the test of October 7, 1903, when the aerodrome\ncame down in the water at a speed of something like fifty miles an\nhour, and at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees, no break\noccurred in either propeller until, when the aerodrome was plunging\nthrough the water, a blade of one propeller was broken by the terrific\nblow which it received when it struck the water under the impulse of\nthe engine driving it at full speed The severity of this blow is attested\nby the fact that the shaft, which was of steel tubing one-eighth inch\nthick, was twisted about ninety degrees This experience with propellers very strongly emphasizes the fact\nthat on any flying machine the strains which are apt to be met with in\nthe open air must be allowed for in the proportioning of the parts of\nthe machine But since an indiscriminate increase of strength in all the\nvarious parts of the machine would entail a prohibitory weight, very\ncareful judgment, based on experience, will have to be exercised in\ndeciding just where added strength must be employed, and also where\n\n\nthe “live strains” are not apt to exceed very appreciably the\ncalculation for statical conditions PL 59 WING CLAMPS ◊ lgr\n[p183]\nOwing to Mr Langley’s belief that the tests of the man-carrying\naerodrome must not only be made over the water, but that it was\nnecessary that the machine be launched from a car running on a track\nat a considerable elevation in order to permit the machine to drop a\nshort distance after being launched in case it was not quite up to\nsoaring speed when launched, it was necessary that the aerodrome be\nso constructed that it could be readily transported to the launching\ntrack from the interior of the house-boat where it was stored This\nplan of storing the main body of the machine in the interior of the\nboat and hoisting it to the launching track just before attempting a\nflight (some of the difficulties of which may be more clearly\nappreciated by an inspection of Plate 60), made it necessary that the\nwings, tail and guy-posts be so constructed as to be readily attachable\nto and detachable from the main frame, and since the weather\nconditions are seldom suitable for a test for more than a couple of\nhours at a time, it was necessary that the mechanism employed for\nattaching these parts be so arranged that the proper settings of the\ndifferent parts could be quickly obtained, and without requiring the\nexercise of judgment which past experience had shown did not often\nmanifest itself during the hurry of the preparations for a test While\nthe wings, therefore, were made removable, yet all of the sockets,\nguy-wires, etc , which were loosened in removing them, were made\nwith positive stops on them so that each fitting that was to be\ntightened up in assembling could be adjusted to its definitely\ndetermined position As all of the models had been constructed with these same parts\nremovable in order to permit them to be readily shipped back and\nforth in the many trips which had been made with them from\nWashington to Chopawamsic Island, the same details of arrangement\nwere used for attaching these parts on the large aerodrome, though\nthe actual fittings by which the parts were attached in the latter case\n\n\nbecame more elaborate In the drawings, Plates 52, 53 and 54, the method of attaching the\nwings to the frame is clearly shown Each of the two main ribs of each\nwing was secured to the midrod of the frame by a wing clamp, shown\nin detail in Figs 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 of Plate 59 Figs 1 and 2 show the\nclamp for the middle main rib of each pair of wings, and Figs 5 and 6\nshow the clamp for the main front rib, the latter being so constructed\nthat the wings could be rocked on the midrib clamp as a pivot and\nsecured at any angle of lift desired from\n6\n1\n2\ndegrees to 15 degrees The horns on each clamp merely acted as\nreceiving sockets for the ends of the ribs, and were not in any way\nintended to do anything more than merely hold the ends of the ribs in\ntheir correct positions The wings were fastened to the frame by the\nguy-wires which ran from two points on each main rib to an upper\nand a lower guy-post mounted on the midrod The system of guy-\nwires for the wings is clearly shown in Plates 52, 53 and 54, and\n[p184] in Plate 61, which shows the aerodrome mounted on its\nlaunching car at the rear end of the track, and with the front pair of\nwings in place and all the guy-wires adjusted The details of the guy-\nposts are shown in Plate 62, where it will be noted that the lower guy-\npost was of wood, with metal fittings, and was 2 metres long from the\ncenter of the midrod to the bottom, while the upper guy-post was a\nsteel tube 109 centimetres long from the center of the midrod to its\ntop The guy-wires from the middle rib of each of the pair of wings\nwere fastened to the fittings at the bottom of the lower guy-post,\nwhile the wires from the front main rib were fastened to the fittings\nwhich were brazed and riveted to the slidable collar, which was\nmounted on the steel tube forming the cap on this guy-post This\ncollar was made slidable to permit the angle of lift of the wings to be\nreadily changed without affecting the length of the guy-wires This\ncollar, when once set for any particular angle of the wing, was\nprevented from sliding by a taper pin (not shown) which passed\nthrough it and the guy-post In order to secure the wings more rigidly\nto the main frame and thereby throw on it all torsional strains from\nthe wings, which it was specially designed to take, each of the middle\n\n\nmain ribs was secured to one of the main tubes of the main frame by\nan auxiliary clamp at the point where this rib crossed the main tube These auxiliary clamps are clearly shown in Figs 3 and 4 of Plate 59 Projecting from the lower end of each of the lower guy-posts was a\nfive-sixteenth-inch steel rod about one inch long, as clearly seen in\nPlate 62 Brazed to the side of this rod, in such a position that it\nwould project towards the rear of the aerodrome when the guy-post\nwas in position, was a small arm or bracket When the guy-post was in\nplace with the aerodrome on the launching car, this pin was in a slot\nformed in a metal cap on the top of the small folding upright at the\nfront or rear of the car, as seen in Fig 1, Plate 63, while Fig 2 of\nPlate 63 shows the pin just being inserted into this slot as the guy-\nwires of the guy-post are being fastened This small arm or bracket on\nthis rod projected under the cap to prevent the rod of the guy-post\nfrom being lifted out of the slot in the folding upright, when the wind\nacting under the wings tended to lift the aerodrome from the car Particular attention is here called to this apparently

◊\n[p185]\nAVIATOR’S\nCAR\nIn determining on a suitable car for the aviator various designs\nwere made, differing all the way from that in which the aviator\noccupied a sitting position facing directly ahead and with practically\nno freedom of movement, but was even strapped to the machine to\navoid the possibility of being thrown out, to the one finally adopted,\nin which he was provided with the greatest freedom of movement,\ncould either stand or sit, as the occasion seemed to demand, and could\nface in any direction for giving proper attention to any of the\nmultitudinous things which might at any time require his attention,\nand could, if agile, even climb from the extreme front of the machine\nto the rear The wisdom of giving the aviator complete freedom\nwithout hampering him in any way by provisions for preventing his\nbeing thrown out of the machine was amply justified, as will later be\nseen in the description of the tests of the machine, where freedom of\nmovement and agility prevented a fatal accident The aviator’s car was therefore designed to occupy the entire\navailable space between the engine and the front bearing points, and\nbetween the two main tubes of the main frame, thus allowing him a\nspace of something like three feet by five feet The car itself was\nshaped like a flat-bottomed boat, the bottom being approximately\nlevel with the bottom of the lower pyramid It had a guard rail of steel\ntubing eighteen inches above the floor, with a cloth covering drawn\nover the frame to decrease the head resistance of the appurtenances of\nthe engine which were placed at the rear end of the car The car was\nsupported by vertical wires passing from its bottom up to the main\nframe, and was prevented from longitudinal or side motion by being\nfastened at the front to the cross-rod connecting the front bearing\npoints, and at the rear to the lower pyramid A light wooden seat\nextended fore and aft of the car at a height of about two feet from the\nfloor, this seat resting on blocks of sponge rubber to absorb some of\nthe tremor which existed in the whole aerodrome when the engine\n\n\nand propellers were working at high speed The aviator was thus free\nto stand, to sit sidewise or to straddle the seat, and while the network\nof wires surrounding him prevented any great possibility of his being\nthrown out, yet there was a comparatively large opening between the\nguy-wires passing overhead which permitted him to climb out of the\nmachine In order to enable the aviator to know exactly how the engine was\noperating, a tachometer, giving instantaneous readings of the number\nof revolutions, was connected by a suitable gear to one of the\ntransmission shafts and placed where it could readily be seen During 1898 and 1899 considerable time and attention had been\ngiven to designing an instrument to be carried by the aerodrome\nwhich would automatically record the number of revolutions of the\nengine, the velocity and direction [p186] of the wind relative to the\nmachine, the height of the aerodrome as shown by a specially\nsensitive aneroid barometer, and the angle of the machine with the\nhorizontal plane of the earth The construction of this instrument was\nundertaken by a noted firm of instrument makers, but after many\nmonths of delay, during which it was several times delivered as being\ncomplete, only to be returned for further work, it was finally\ncondemned as unsatisfactory, and it was decided not to encumber the\nmachine with such a delicate apparatus, which, even if perfectly\nmade, could not be depended on to work properly when mounted on\nthe aerodrome frame, in which there was a constant, though minute,\ntremor due to the high speed and power of the engine The completed frame, which is perhaps best shown in Plates 49, 50\nand 51, and Plate 60, Figs 1, 2 and 3, in spite of its size gave an\nappearance of grace and strength which is inadequately represented in\nthe photographs In making the designs for the large aerodrome no\ndata were available for use in calculating the strains that would come\non the different parts of the frame while in the air, and the size and\nthickness of the tubes and the strength of the guy-wires were\nconsequently determined almost entirely by “rule of thumb,” backed\nby experience with the models Although the dimensions, shape, and\narrangement of most of the auxiliary parts of the machine were\nconsiderably changed during the course of construction in accordance\nwith the indications of the exhaustive series of shop tests, the\n\n\nfundamental features of the construction were practically unaltered,\nbut the changes in the guy-wire system and in the fittings by which\nthey were attached, made the frame as a whole several times as strong\nas it was originally, and it was felt that the direction of further\nimprovements in it would be shown only by actual test of it in flight\nwhere any weaknesses would be certain to manifest themselves It may be well to remark here that even with the data which were\nlater obtained, judgment based on experience proved after all to be\nthe safest guide for proportioning the strength of the various parts It\ncan be assumed that a live stress will produce a strain ten times as\ngreat as that due to a static stress on the part when the machine is\nstationary For greater safety, it would be still better to assume a\nstrain twenty times as great If one is building bridges, houses, and\nsimilar structures, where weight is not a prime consideration, it would\nbe criminal negligence to fail to provide a sufficient “factor of safety,”\nor what in many instances may be more properly termed a “factor of\nignorance,” while at the present time the insistence on large factors of\nsafety in machines intended to fly would so enormously increase the\nweight that, before one-half the necessary parts were provided, the\nweight would be many times what could possibly be supported in the\nair Later, no doubt, as experience is gained in properly handling the\nmachine in the air, increased strength entailing [p187] increased\nweight may be added in proportion to the skill acquired; and there is\nno doubt that man will acquire this skill with marvelous rapidity,\napproaching, if not equaling, that exhibited by him in the use of the\nbicycle, which, when first ridden, requires not only all of the rider’s\nskill but that of a couple of assistants, but when once mastered\nrequires hardly more thought for its proper manipulation than even\nthe act of walking involves, the balancing and guiding being done\nintuitively merely by the motion of the body and with practically no\nexertion ◊\n[p188]\nCHAPTER VI\nCONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORTING SURFACES\nAn examination of the wings of birds, whether those of soarers or of\nany other type, impresses one not only with the general strength of\nthe wing, but also with the fact that, while it possesses considerable\nstiffness, there is also a graduated pliability, not only of the whole\nwing, including the bones, but more especially in the feathers, the\nrear tips being exceedingly pliable so that, when the wing is held in a\nstiff breeze, they are seen to be easily deflected in a gentle curve\ntowards the rear and upper side This lack of rigidity has several\nadvantages, among the more notable of which is the lessening of the\nstrains on the wing caused by sudden wind gusts Of great importance\nis the further fact that a supporting surface having a graduated\npliability, such as is possessed by a bird’s wing, does not experience a\nshifting of the center of pressure to the same extent as a rigid surface\nof similar form Furthermore, since any bird, even the best soarer,\nmust use its wings not only for soaring, but, when starting to fly from\na state of rest, for flapping, a rigid surface would not furnish anything\nlike the same universally available sustaining and propelling means\nthat the bird’s wing does In an inspection of the various wings or supporting surfaces which\nMr Langley built, from the very earliest rubber-pull models up to the\nsuccessful steam machines Nos 5 and 6, the point which is most\nimpressed upon the observer is the increasing strength and rigidity\nembodied in these wings While the success with the later models was\ndue to many things, including the development of a strong frame and\na suitable power plant giving sufficient power for the permissible\nweight, besides the very important development of effective\nequilibrium mechanism, yet it is safe to say that even with the\ndevelopment of all these other things to the state to which they had\nbeen brought in 1896, success would not have been achieved had not\nthe wings themselves been simultaneously changed from the very\nflimsy construction which was at first used to the later type, using a\nvery strong and rigid wooden frame over which the cloth covering\n\n\nwas tightly stretched, and which possessed only a small amount of\npliability at the extreme rear ends of the cross-ribs The development of this successful type of wing for the models, it\nwill be remembered, had been achieved only after an extensive series\nof experiments; and it was realized that the construction of suitable\nwings for the large aerodrome, even with the knowledge gained in the\nearly work, would be still more [p189] difficult The problem was that\nof constructing for a very little greater weight per square foot, wings\ncontaining approximately sixteen times the area of the model wings It will be recalled from the previous description of model\nAerodrome No 5, that its four wings had a combined area of 68\nsquare feet and weighed approximately 2500 grammes, or 37\ngrammes per square foot It was not expected that the large wings\nwould be of so light a weight per square foot, which would have\nmeant only about 35,500 grammes (approximately 78 pounds) weight\nfor the 960 square feet originally planned It was hoped, however,\nthat the increase in weight per square foot for the large wings would\nbe less than the square root of the increased linear dimensions In this\ncase, the increase in linear dimensions being approximately four, it\nwas, therefore, hoped that the larger wings would not have quite\ntwice the weight per square foot of the smaller ones; the computed\nweight permissible for the large wings was therefore placed at 120\npounds To obtain the required area within the permissible limits of weight\ntwo well-defined paths of procedure were open: First, it was possible\nto so modify the structural form of the wing as to obtain the\nadvantage of the increased strength of trussed structures, that is, by\nsuperposing the wings Or, second, the “single-tier” type of wing, the\nefficiency of which had been fairly well determined, could be\nretained, and strength gained without increase of weight by\nimproving the method of constructing the wooden framework and by\nextending the system of guy-wires Some knowledge of the superposed type of supporting surfaces had\nalready been gained by the experiments at Allegheny and the tests of\nthe rubber-driven models, in which superposed wings had frequently\nbeen used; but it was felt that this knowledge was altogether\ninadequate to aid in determining either whether the superposed type\n\n\nof construction possessed in practice the advantages which theory\nwould indicate, or how and at what distance apart the surfaces should\nbe superposed to obtain the best results In order to obtain the desired\ninformation, a series of tests on the whirling-table of complete wings\nsuitable for use on the models was made These experiments were\nsupplemented by the practical tests with the models, which have\nalready been described in Chapter III ◊, in order to give the wings a\ntrial under the conditions of flight, where they would be subjected to\nthe action of the propellers and the uneven character of the wind In addition to determining what type of construction and what form\nof surface would give the greatest “lift” with the smallest “drift,” these\nwhirling-table tests supplied data as to how much greater the actual\nresistance of the wing with its necessary guy-posts and guy-wires was\nthan the theoretical resistance, found by extrapolation from the results\nobtained in the tests of rigid [p190] curved surfaces formed of wood The first of this series of tests, the results of which are given below,\nwas made November 30, 1898, on the superposed wing shown in\nPlate 37, Figs 1 and 2",

“conventional” forms of wings, various other types\nwere tested on the whirling-table The data of these tests are not\ngiven, as in the rough preliminary tests the results were so entirely\nnegative in character that accurate quantitative tests were never\nmade However, since in work of this kind the greatest delay is\nexperienced in learning what not to do, and in ridding one’s self of\nfreak notions which are continually suggesting themselves, it may be\n\n\nwell here to describe sufficiently at least one of these types of wing to\nenable others to avoid any loss of time in experiments with it Since\nthe principal disadvantages of a wing possessing considerable width in\nthe fore and aft direction are due to the great extent through which\nthe center of pressure [p194] shifts when the velocity of advance or\nangle of incidence is changed, and to the further fact that a wide\nsurface does not support proportionately as much per square foot as a\nlong and narrow one, it was thought that some advantage might be\ngained by making the covering of the wing in the form of strips, the\nedges of which would be perpendicular to the direction of motion, or\nby making this covering in more or less slat-like form, which would\npermit the air which had already been acted upon by the leading slat\nto slip through between the rear edge of the first slat and the leading\nedge of the succeeding one In the tests on the whirling-table,\nhowever, it was found that this type of construction not only did not\npossess any advantages, but was even less effective than a similar one\nin which the covering was continuous The difference was probably\ndue to the fact that the air which passed between the slats reduced the\nsuction on the upper side of the following slat, and also to the fact\nthat the distance between the slats was not sufficient to gain the effect\nof having each slat act on air which had not already been partially\ndeflected by the preceding one In view of the results of these tests on various types of wings, it was\ndecided that in constructing the first set of wings for the large\naerodrome it would be best to employ the “single-tier” type, which\nhad proved successful with the models, and that after getting a\nsuccessful flight with these the superposed wings would be tried in\norder to get, if possible, the advantage which they possessed of being\nstructurally stronger and more compact It was therefore clear that\nany gain in the strength and rigidity of the first set of wings, as a\nwhole, would have to be obtained by improvements in the\nconstruction of its integral parts, that is, in the main and cross-ribs\nwhich made up its framework Before attempting to proportion the parts of the necessary wooden\nwing frame, which it was expected would probably undergo many\nchanges before a final design was secured which would embody\nmaximum strength for minimum weight, various tests were made to\n\n\ndetermine just how light a cloth covering could be obtained which\nwould be strong enough and sufficiently impervious to the air In the\nconstruction of the wings for the models a good grade of China silk\nhad been employed, but on account of the greatly increased quantity\nof cloth required for the large wings, it was hoped that something\napproximately as good as the silk could be secured at a much less\ncost, and various grades of percaline were therefore tested The\nweight of the various grades of percaline ranged from three grammes\nto ten grammes per square foot, the lighter samples being of a rather\ncoarse mesh, while the heaviest ones were not only close mesh but\nsome specimens contained a large amount of “sizing ” The particular\ngrade which was finally adopted weighed seven grammes per square\nfoot This material was practically impervious to air at a pressure of\none pound per square foot, which, of course, was considerably [p195]\nmore than it would be subjected to in flight This grade of percaline\nweighed approximately one and a half times as much as a grade of\nsilk, which on test was found to have a slightly greater tensile\nstrength than the percaline, though the latter did not “flute” or\n“pocket” nearly as much as the silk Moreover, the cost of the\npercaline was only about one-third that of the silk, and it was chiefly\nfor this reason that percaline was adopted in place of silk Allowing\nfor necessary seams and extra material to be turned over at the front\nand rear edges of the wings, the percaline covering, which under the\noriginal plans comprised approximately 1000 square feet, was\ntherefore calculated to weigh approximately 7000 grammes, exclusive\nof the necessary cords for lacing the coverings to the wooden frames\nof the wings As the one hundred and twenty pounds allowed for the four wings\npermitted only thirty pounds per wing, and as the cloth covering,\nlacing cords, etc , were found to weigh something over four pounds,\nthere remained only about 25 pounds as the permissible weight of the\nwooden framing, including the necessary metal clips, secondary guy-\nwires, etc , for each wing With the relative proportions of the various\nparts of the wooden framing of the wings of the models as a basis, it\nwas decided to make the main ribs of the large wings 1 5 inches in\ndiameter for one-half their length, and have them taper from this size\nto one inch in diameter at the extreme point After making allowance\n\n\nfor the weight of these ribs, it was found that, if the cross-ribs were to\nbe spaced no farther than ten inches apart, and the two end ones were\nto be made at least as wide as 1 5 inches in order to resist the end\nstrain due to the stress of the cloth, the twenty-six intermediate cross-\nribs could be only seven-sixteenths of an inch in diameter at the point\nwhere they crossed the main rib, and that they must be tapered to\nthree-eighths of an inch in diameter at the front end and to one-fourth\nof an inch in diameter at the rear tip A trial wing, whose total weight was 30 pounds 2 ounces, was made\nup with the various parts of its frame of the above dimensions Even\nupon inspection it appeared to be too flimsy to withstand the sudden\ngusts of wind which were certain to be met in actual practice In\norder, however, to get some definite data as a guide, the wing was\ninverted and guyed in the same way that it was proposed to guy it on\nthe aerodrome, and a uniform thickness of sand was then sprinkled\nover it to such a depth as to give it a load of 0 7 pounds per square\nfoot Even before one-quarter of the sand was sprinkled over it, it was\nseen that the wing was rapidly going out of shape, and it was feared\nthat the full amount of sand would not only seriously distort it, but\nwould even break it The full quantity of sand, however, did not break\nit, but distorted it to such an extent that, had the pressure been due to\nits being propelled through the air, its serious change in form would\nhave rendered it worse than useless [p196] While the main ribs had\nshown a certain amount of deflection under the sanding test, the more\nserious distortion had been in the cross-ribs, the small guy-wires,\nwhich had been fastened to each cross-rib, becoming loose instead of\ntight, as had been expected, since the rib tended to increase its\ncurvature instead of straightening out This increase in the curvature\nof the cross-ribs was partly overcome by tying the guy-wire flat\nagainst the cross-rib for a distance of about 2 feet from the rear tip But while this caused the guy-wire to tighten the general contour of\nthe wing showed very little improvement, as the ribs now assumed a\ncurve more or less like the letter S, the rear tip now being bent\ndownward to form the tail of the elongated S From this sanding test it was seen that the cross-ribs must be\nmaterially stiffer, and a new set was accordingly made one-sixteenth\nof an inch larger in diameter at the various points of measurement Upon giving the wing, equipped with these larger ribs, a sanding test\nit was found that, while there had been some improvement, it was\nentirely too flimsy, even when it been double-guyed by running a\nsecond wire on each cross-rib from the middle of the portion in front\nof the mid-rib to the middle of the portion behind the mid-rib As the\nweight of the wing with these larger solid cross-ribs had now\nincreased to more than 33 pounds, and the wing had proved itself\naltogether too weak for use on the aerodrome, it was evident that\nsome other plan of constructing the ribs which would give greater\nstrength for the same weight must be found At first sight it might\nappear that the obvious way of increasing the stiffness of the cross-\nribs was to employ a cross-section other than a round one, since\nmaterial added to the depth of the rib is very much more effective\nthan if added to the width It must, however, be remembered that\nthese cross-ribs were 11 feet long, and that, as the main mid-rib was 6\nfeet in front of the rear tips of the cross-ribs, with no intermediate\nbracing, except the light threads by which the cloth cover was\nattached, it was inevitable that, should the depth be made materially\ngreater than the width, the rib would buckle sideways Test ribs of I-\nbeam form, which are later described, were constructed, but, although\nthey proved exceedingly stiff, had to be discarded In view of these facts the obvious remedy appeared to be to make\nthe rib hollow, and one cross-rib,\n3\n4\nof an inch in diameter at the point where it crossed the main rib,\ntapering to\n5\n8\nof an inch at the front and\n3\n8\nof an inch at the rear tip, was accordingly constructed Tests showed\nthat this form of rib, which was about 10 grammes lighter than the\n1\n2\n-inch\nsolid ribs, was much stiffer than anything yet constructed But when a\nwing, with cross-ribs of this size placed 20 inches apart, was sanded it\nwas found that, although a great advance in construction had been\n\n\nmade, still further improvement was necessary before a suitable wing\nfor the large aerodrome could be procured [p197]\nBefore proceeding with the construction of any more complete\nwings, an extended series of experiments was made in order to secure\nribs of proper lightness and strength Various forms of metal tubes\nwere tested; but, although aluminum seemed at one time to promise\ngood results, it was found that hollow ribs could be constructed of\nspruce which were much stronger than aluminum tubes of the same\nweight In order to determine more accurately what mode of\nconstruction would give the greatest stiffness and strength for a\nminimum weight, it was decided to make up some test pieces of\ndifferent forms before making up complete ribs For convenience in\nconstruction, these test pieces were made straight and shorter than\nthe large cross-ribs Each piece was tested by fastening it in the testing\nclamp with 1 metre of its length projecting horizontally, and attaching\nat its end a weight of 1 kilogramme The deflection from the\nhorizontal gave an index of the stiffness of the piece under\nexamination The first test piece was a hollow square, 17 mm length of side on\nthe exterior, and 11 mm length of side on the interior, the walls thus\nbeing 3 mm thick This weighed 73 grammes per metre and had\nsmall internal stiffening pieces, like the partitions in bamboo, glued\ninto it 4 inches apart A weight of 1 kilogramme at the distance of 1\nmetre gave a deflection of 56 mm The second test piece was a\nduplicate of the first one, except that it had no internal stiffening\npieces, and the weight per metre was made the same, 73 grammes, as\nformerly, by leaving the walls a fraction thicker The deflection in this\ncase was, as would be expected, exactly the same as in the first one The first test piece, however, was superior to the second one in that it\nwas stiffer against being crushed in by accident The third test piece\nwas a hollow cylinder, 22 mm outside diameter and 17 mm inside\ndiameter, the walls thus being 2 5 mm thick The weight per metre\nwas 91 grammes, and the deflection was 46 mm The fourth test was\nmade by taking two of the original solid cross-ribs, 12 mm in\ndiameter, and fastening them in the clamp side by side, with a length\nof 1 metre projecting The weight per metre for the two ribs was 105\ngrammes, and the deflection produced on the two by 1 kilogramme at\n\n\n1 metre distance was 115 mm The fifth test piece was an I-beam of\nspruce, having a depth of 25 mm , with the flanges 12 5 mm wide\nand the web 3 mm thick The weight per metre was 65 grammes, and\nthe deflection was 26 mm All of these test pieces were made of\ncarefully selected straight-grained spruce It is readily seen that the test piece having the I-beam section\nweighed less than the hollow square in the first and second tests, and\nhad a deflection of less than half This I-beam section, however, did\nnot show up so well when a longer piece was tested, for as soon as the\nlength was made appreciably greater than a metre it began to twist,\nthe twisting becoming more and more serious the [p198] greater the\nlength, until with a piece 11 feet long, the full length of a cross-rib,\nthe twisting was so serious as to make the rib practically useless It\nwas at first thought that this twisting might be overcome by making\nthe webs slightly wider, and it would to a certain extent, but in\nlooking ahead and planning how the cross-ribs were to be fastened to\nthe main ribs, the I-beam section was seen to present so many\ndifficulties that it was thought hardly worth while to spend time on\nfurther experiments with it This decision was made all the more\nimperative by foreseeing the difficulty of bending the I-beam section\nto the curve which the cross-ribs were to have In fact it had been\nfound by experience that while many different forms of ribs could be\nbent to the proper curve by steaming and clamping them over a form\nand then drying them out while still clamped to the form, yet the\ngrain of the wood varied so in different ribs, that of a dozen steamed\nand bent over the same form it was seldom that as many as three\nwould have approximately the same amount of curvature when\nremoved from the form after drying If, however, the curve was\nformed in the ribs by making them in two parts, which were glued\ntogether and clamped up on the form while the glue dried, practically\nany number could be made which would have the same curvature\nwhen thinned down to the proper thickness of wall It was recognized at all times that the gluing together of the ribs not\nonly entailed extra work, but introduced an element of uncertainty\nunless some kind of a varnish for the ribs could be found which would\nprevent any possibility of the glue becoming soft from moisture in the\natmosphere or from the wings actually coming down into the water\n\n\nwhen the aerodrome was tried in flight A search was therefore made\nfor a varnish that was water-proof A large number of different\nvarnishes were tried, and one was finally found which, after repeated\ntests, seemed to be thoroughly good Several test ribs were given three\ncoats of this varnish, and were then kept immersed in water for 24\nhours without the glue showing any signs of softening It was\ntherefore decided to follow the plan of gluing the ribs together and\nprotecting them with three coats of this varnish, which seemed to\npossess the remarkable properties of being not only impervious to\nwater, but also unaffected by the application of concentrated\nammonia or of gasoline, either of which produces immediate\nsoftening when applied to ordinary varnishes Following the indication of these tests that the hollow, round\nsection, 22 mm outside diameter by 17 mm inside diameter, would\nprobably give the best cross-rib for the weight that it seemed possible\nto allow, a set of cross-ribs of this form was constructed and put in\nplace in the large experimental wing, in which the former solid ribs\nhad been tested The wing was inverted and fastened into two posts at\nthe angle it would have in flight, the guy-wires from the [p199] lower\nguy-posts of the aerodrome being represented by wires stretched from\nthe posts In actual use on the aerodrome it was proposed to have\nthree main guy-wires running from each of the main cross-ribs to the\nlower guy-post, but in the test, which is now to be described, the\nwires which would have come nearest the body of the machine were\nleft off to see what effect their removal would have on the wing The weight and dimensions of the wing, as set up, were as follows:\nLength of the main ribs, 24 feet; length of the cloth covering, 22 feet;\nwidth of the cloth covering, 11 feet; total weight, 29 pounds The two\nmain ribs (front rib and mid-rib) were solid, 3 5 cm in diameter at\nbutt, 2 5 cm in diameter at tip, and tapering from the middle to the\ntip There were twelve regular cross-ribs set 50 8 cm (20 inches)\napart, each rib being as above described, 11 feet long, 22 mm outside\ndiameter by 17 mm inside diameter at the butt, and tapering from\nwhere they were attached to the mid-rib to the tip, and each weighing\n300 grammes There were two extra cross-ribs, one at the inner end\nnext to the body of the machine and the other at the outer end These\nwere solid strips of wood 3 8 cm wide by 1 2 cm thick, made extra\n\n\nwide and stiff in order to withstand the strain of stretching the cloth\ncovering There was also a thin, flat strip at the rear edge, which\nconnected together all the tips of the cross-ribs, holding them a\nuniform distance apart, and also serving to fasten the cloth The main\nmid-rib was stiffened in a vertical direction by a system of small guy-\nwires drawn over short guy-posts about 6 inches high With the wing\ninverted and fastened in the way above described, a weight of 2\nkilogrammes placed at the inner rear corner produced a deflection of\n26 7 cm When the inner rear corner was pulled up by a spring\nbalance until the balance registered 2 kilogrammes, there was an\nupward deflection of 41 3 cm When the main mid-rib was held at the\ninner end, the pull of 2 kilogrammes, applied to the inner corner as\nbefore, caused an upward deflection of 25 4 cm instead of 41 3 cm This wing was afterwards given a sanding test under a weight of 0 7\npound per square foot With fine guy-wires fastened from the front of\nthe cross-ribs to the tip and drawn just taut, the ribs showed an\naverage deflection of 9 inches at the tip under the above weight When a small wooden guy-post was added under each of these small\nguy-wires, the same weight produced an average deflection of 5\ninches at the tip of each rib under the same load In a previous test of\nthe wing, using hollow cross-ribs 16 mm outside diameter by 10 mm inside diameter at the butt, and only half as far apart as the later ones,\na load of 1 pound per square foot on the wing produced an average\ndeflection of 9 inches at the tip of each rib when the cross guy-wires\non each rib were held up by short guy-posts, but when these short\nguy-posts were removed, the same load produced a deflection of\nnearly 25 inches at the tip of each rib [p200]\nAlthough this wing was a great improvement in every way over any\nof the previous constructions, it was felt that it was too weak for the\nlarge aerodrome Further experiments were therefore made in order to\nsecure a form of cross-rib which would meet the rigorous\nrequirements imposed An inordinate amount of time was spent in the\nconstruction and tests of various forms of rib, but as a result a\nsatisfactory cross-rib was at last constructed of the form shown in\nPlate 66, Figs 4–8, the dimensions at the three principal points, viz ,\nfirst, where the cross-ribs join the front rib; second, where they cross\nthe mid-rib; and third, at the rear tip, being given both for the\n\n\nintermediate cross-ribs and the end cross-ribs Following the plan employed by Nature in the construction of the\nbamboo pole, small partitions, approximately one millimetre thick,\nwere placed every three inches in the thin, hollow rib to keep it from\nbeing crushed The partitions were glued in place when the hollow rib\nwas glued together on the form around which it was bent and\nclamped until the glue dried Longer blocks were also inserted in each\nof the intermediate ribs at the point where it crossed the main rib and\nalso at the front end where it was attached to the front rib In the end\nribs blocks were also inserted at the points where the cross-braces\nwere fastened to them for resisting the end stress due to the cloth\ncovering Upon making up one of these ribs and testing it, it was found to\npossess remarkable stiffness, so much so that it was thought probable\nthat it was as stiff in proportion to its size as the best thing that\nNature had produced in the bird’s wing A large quill from the wing of\na harpy eagle was therefore stripped and the large end clamped in a\nspecial holder, and measurements were made of the deflection\nproduced by weights at various distances from the clamp As the main\nmid-rib of the wing of the aerodrome is placed approximately at the\npoint of the center of pressure, the bending action on the cross-ribs\nmay be assumed to act on a lever arm from the mid-rib towards the\nfront, and from the mid-rib towards the rear in the cases of the\npressure on the front and rear portions of the wing, respectively In\ntesting these cross-ribs, therefore, against the quill, the rib was\nclamped at the point where it crosses the mid-rib of the wing, and\nmeasurements were made of the deflection produced by weights\nplaced at various distances from the point of clamping both front and\nrear PL 66 DETAILS OF RIBS AND FITTINGS FOR WINGS ◊ lgr\nPL 67 CROSS SECTION OF RIBS ◊ lgr\nThe quill on which the measurements were made was 19 5 inches\nlong and had a gradual curve, the highest point of the curve being\nabout the center of the length of the quill, and the depth of curvature\nbeing about 2 inches When the butt of this quill was placed in the\nclamp the tip stood 17 cm above the horizontal The hollow spruce\nrib, when clamped at a point 5 feet from the tip (the point from which\nit tapers in both directions) had its tip 2 2 cm above the horizontal,\nthere being very little curve in that portion of the rib The quill\nweighed 4 grammes when stripped and 18 inches of it projected from\nthe [p201] clamp which held it during the tests The rear portion of the\nspruce rib projected 5 feet from the clamp, being thus 3 3 times as\nlong as the quill, and it weighed 120 grammes, the weight for the\nlarger size having, therefore, increased slightly less than the cube of\nthe length The results of the tests of both the quill and the rib are given in the\nfollowing table The approximate cross-section of the quill at the point\nof clamping, the middle and the tip are shown in diagrams A, B and C,\nrespectively, of Plate 67 The cross-sections of the rib at the\ncorresponding points are shown in diagrams D, E and F The

to\nproduce the deflection It should be noted, however, that the relative\ndeflection was quite different in the two comparisons In the case of\nthe quill the deflection was 17 cm in 45 cm , or 38 per cent; in the\ncase of the rib it was 17 cm in 153 cm , or 11 per cent In the case of\nthe rib at the point 0 39 the absolute weight was 15,000 grammes, the\nrelative weight unity and the deflection in terms of length 0 11",
    "11 While\nno rigorous comparison can be instituted, since the rib was not\ndeflected nearly as much proportionately as the quill, yet the general\ninference is that while the rib was not intended to be, and was not as\nelastic proportionately as the quill, it was probably at least as strong\nin proportion to its weight Briefly summarizing these results it will be\nnoted that the spruce rib was about 3 3 times the length and 30 times\nas heavy, while it was 15 times as stiff near the butt and 26 times as\nstiff at the tip, as the quill As this test on the rib for the large wings had apparently shown that\nthe plan of constructing the ribs in the form of a hollow square\nsecured maximum strength for minimum weight, it was decided to\nconstruct a few sample ribs after the same plan for the wings of the\n\n\nnew quarter-size model of the large aerodrome, and to test, these ribs\nin a similar manner The following table shows the results of the test\non one of these ribs:\nTotal

and to 7 mm × 2 mm at the tip The rib was clamped with the tip\nprojecting [p202] 46 cm and was weighted at different percentages of its\nlength to such an extent that it was deflected 11 per cent of

primarily for use in tests to determine the best form to employ,\nmay be mentioned the following, in which both ribs were seven-\nsixteenths of an inch outside diameter and five-sixteenths of an inch\ninside diameter One was filled with elder pith, formed up into a\nround rod that just fit the interior of the hollow rib, and was glued\ninto it when the rib was glued up The other rib was left hollow Upon\ntesting these by suspending weights at different points, the rib\nwithout [p203] the pith showed a slightly less deflection than the one\nwith it, it happening probably that the wood in one case was a little\nstiffer than in the other, although they were carefully selected to be as\nnearly alike as possible The rib with the pith in it weighed 34\ngrammes and the one without it weighed 30 grammes It was inferred\nfrom this test that the placing of a light pithy material in the interior\nof the ribs would have no good effect, and would not only add weight,\nbut also complicate the construction The reason for making this test\nwith pith in one of the ribs was that it was thought probable that the\nrib flattened out somewhat when it was deflected under a load, and\nthat the pith stiffened with the glue with which it was fastened in,\nmight lessen this As the cross-rib described above, which was tested on October 23,\n1899, seemed in every way suited for use in the wings of the large\naerodrome, a complete wing equipped with similar ribs but of slightly\nchanged dimensions, as shown in Plate 66, Fig 5, was immediately\nconstructed As previous tests had shown that the wing covering did\nnot “flute” or “pocket” to any considerable extent even when the ribs\nwere as much as thirty inches apart, only ten cross-ribs were used in\nthis wing The eight intermediate cross-ribs were of the form\ndescribed above, but the ribs at either end of the wing were made of a\n\n\nlarger cross-section and otherwise stiffened in order to resist the strain\nof the tightly stretched cloth covering On April 13, 1900, a final sanding test was made on this wing,\nguyed in a manner similar to that used in the aerodrome, in which the\nfollowing results were obtained:\nSANDING TEST OF LARGE WING Area, 260 sq ft ; weight of wing, 29 pounds;\nweight of sand on wing, 231 pounds; total\nweight supported by wing, 260 pounds, or\none pound per square foot Deflection of cross-rib, numbering from\ninner edge to extreme outer edge of wing—\n    Number of\nrib Deflection Inches 1 (Heavy\nend rib)\n 5 5 \n 2\n 9 5 \n 3\n11 75\n 4\n12 25\n 5\n12 5 \n 6\n12

be\nimposed upon it in flight, and was in fact 1 2 times as great as the\nnormal pressure when supporting the aerodrome as finally\nconstructed Even under this weight the greatest deflection noted in\nterms of the total length of the rib was less than 0 10, showing that\nthe elastic limit of the rib was far from being reached [p204]\nAs this test seemed to indicate that the wings constructed in this\nmanner were certainly strong and rigid enough for use on the\naerodrome, and that immediate further improvement could hardly be\nmade, three similar wings were at once constructed to complete the\nset Somewhat later two additional wings were provided, so that when\nthe large aerodrome was taken to Widewater on the Potomac in 1903\none and a half complete sets of wings were on hand, which seemed to\nbe ample to provide for any emergencies that might arise Each of these wings had, as is clearly shown in the drawings, Plates\n\n\n53 and 54, two main ribs, which formed the main strength of the\nframework and gave the wing longitudinal rigidity To the main front\nrib were attached the cross-ribs and the pieces for the curved\nextension later described The mid-rib extended across the cross-ribs,\nparallel to and about 5 feet behind the front rib, this being\napproximately the line in which lay the center of pressure of the wing It was upon this rib, therefore, that the greatest strain would fall The mid-rib, Plate 66, Fig 2, was 731 5 cm (24 ft ) long, having at\nthe butt an outer diameter of 38 mm (1 5 in ) and an inner diameter\nof 25 mm (1 in ), the walls being, therefore, approximately 6 5 mm (0 25 in ) thick From the butt to the middle point the section was\nuniform, but from this point it had a taper of one-twenty-fourth of an\ninch to the foot, so that at the tip it had an outer diameter of 25 mm",
    "From the butt to the middle point the section was\nuniform, but from this point it had a taper of one-twenty-fourth of an\ninch to the foot, so that at the tip it had an outer diameter of 25 mm (1 in ), the thickness of the wall being unchanged At the butt end a\nwooden block 8 inches long was glued inside the rib, and at uniform\ndistances of 75 mm (30 in ) 10 smaller blocks were glued in where\nthe cross-ribs were attached The main front rib was of the same form\nand size, except that it was some 2 inches shorter and had no blocks,\nexcept the long one at the butt, glued in it To these main ribs were attached, in the manner later described, the\n10 cross-ribs, to which the cloth cover was attached The 8\nintermediate cross-ribs have already been described in connection\nwith the tests The cross-ribs at the end of the wings, upon which\ngreater lateral strains would come from the stretching of the cloth,\nwere made of the larger cross-section shown in Fig 8 of Plate 66 Additional longitudinal stiffness was provided by gluing a strip 2 mm thick between the upper and lower halves, as shown in the section These end ribs, as well as those next to the ends, had small blocks\nglued into them where they were crossed by the diagonal braces, in\naddition to the small partitions 1 mm thick, which were glued into\nthe ribs every 3 inches to prevent crushing, and the blocks 2 5 and 3\ninches long respectively, where they were attached to the front rib\nand to the mid-rib At the extreme rear edge of the wing the cross-ribs\nwere attached to the small “D”-rib, which served to hold the ribs at\nequal distances and to keep the cloth cover stretched tight This “D”-\nrib, as shown in Plate 66, Fig 3, had semi-circular walls 4 mm thick,\n21 mm in diameter, to the edge of which was glued a flat strip 3 mm thick [p205]\nAs originally designed the wings had a curve of only 1 in 18, the\nmain front rib forming the leading edge of the wing Later, however,\nit seemed desirable to “quicken” the curve and at the same time give\nthe wing a sharper leading edge This was accomplished by attaching\nto the front rib, at the points where the cross-ribs joined it, properly\ncurved wooden pieces of the form shown in Plate 66, Fig 10, over\nwhich the cloth cover of the wing was stretched The curve of the\nwing after the addition of this extension is shown in Plate 66, Fig 4,\nand was a curve having a rise of approximately 1 in 12, with the\nhighest point 25 from the front end",
    "25 from the front end On account of the large size of these wings and the consequent\ndifficulty in handling them it was necessary to construct them in such\na manner that they could be easily taken apart, rolled up, transported\nto the house-boat or any other point where they might need to be\nused, and then quickly reassembled After much experiment as to the\nbest means of constructing them, the following plan was devised The\ncloth covering was permanently fastened to the front rib, to which\nwere attached the front extension pieces by means of small metal clips\nsecured by small wood screws On the rear edge of the front main rib,\nat a uniform distance of 30 inches apart, 10 small metal horns of 1-\nmm tubing, 5 cm long, each brazed to an independent clamping\nthimble, as shown in Fig 9 of Plate 66, were fastened The front end\nof each of the cross-ribs was slightly rounded out to fit the front main\nrib, and in the wooden block which was glued in this end of the cross-\nrib a hole was bored to fit these horns Each of the cross-ribs was then\npushed over its proper horn and against the front main rib, and the\ncloth covering then drawn back toward the rear tips of the cross-ribs In the extreme rear edge of the cloth covering a seam was made, and\nin this was inserted the “D”-rib already described The cloth was then\ntightly stretched and a wood screw forced through the “D”-rib and\ninto and through the metal ferrule at the tip of the cross-rib Near the\ninner and outer edges of the cloth covering eyelets were placed about\n6 inches apart, through which small cords were then inserted and tied\nto the end cross-ribs The main or mid-rib was then placed on top of\nthe cross-ribs and fastened to them with wood screws, and the cross-\nbraces were then fastened on the top of the wing, as shown in Plate\n\n\n54 The frame of the wing was stiffened horizontally by cross guy-\nwires which passed from each cross-rib, at the point where the mid-\nrib crossed it, to the adjoining cross-rib, at the point where it was\nconnected to the front rib Each of the main ribs was individually\nguyed, in the manner clearly shown in Plate 52, in order to stiffen it\nin the vertical direction, the fittings for these guy-wires being shown\nin detail in Figs 11–15 of Plate 66 Finally, small guy-wires were run\nfrom the front end of the cross-ribs over a guy-post 12 inches high at\nthe point where the cross-rib crossed the mid-rib to the rear tip of the\ncross-rib These cross guy-wires were regulated in [p206] tightness by\nraising and lowering a screw in the slot of the head of which they\nrested, and which was threaded in the end of the small guy-post Upper and lower guy-wires, running from the main ribs to the guy-\nposts on the aerodrome, as already described, and as is clearly shown\nin the drawings, Plates 52 and 54, completed the guy-wire system for\nthe wings, except for the “drift wires,” which for the front wings were\nrun from the lower side of the mid-rib to the bowsprit at the front of\nthe machine, and for the rear wings to the main frame Each wing when completely assembled weighed approximately 29\npounds, and had a rectangular surface 22 5 by 11 5 feet (measured on\nthe chord of the curve), or 260 square feet, making the weight per\nsquare foot equal about 50 grammes, rather less than 1 5 times as\nmuch per square foot as the wings for the steam-driven models The\ntotal supporting surface of the aerodrome was 1040 square feet, and\nas the aerodrome when equipped for flight weighed, including the\naviator, 850 pounds this gave 1 22 square feet to the pound, or 0 82\npound to the square foot Although this was a somewhat larger\nproportion of weight to supporting surface than it had originally been\nexpected to have, there is every reason to believe that it was\nsufficient, for the quarter-size model, when weighted so that it had\n1 22 square feet to the pound, flew well, as will later appear ◊\n[p207]\nCHAPTER VII\nEQUILIBRIUM AND CONTROL\nIn an aerodrome it is essential not only that its component parts\nshall be so disposed that the initial equilibrium is correct and highly\nstable, but also that some efficient means be provided for quickly and\naccurately restoring the equilibrium, if for any reason it is disturbed If the aerodrome is of sufficient size and power to carry a human\nbeing it is, of course, possible merely to supply an efficient means of\ncontrolling the lateral and horizontal equilibrium of the machine and\ndepend upon the intelligence and skill of the operator, as developed\nby practice and experience, to maintain the proper equilibrium of the\nmachine while in the air This method, however, is open to the\nobjection that no matter how skilled the aviator may be there remains\nthe probability of a serious if not fatal accident as the result of any\nmomentary lapse or diversion of attention until the “sense of\nequilibrium” has been developed One of the chief problems,\ntherefore, which had impressed itself from the beginning of the work,\nwas to devise some means by which the equilibrium of the aerodrome\nwould be automatically maintained under the varying conditions of\nflight, so as to leave the aviator free, as far as possible, to control the\ndirection of flight and to devote his attention to other important\nmatters connected with the proper functioning of the various parts of\nthe aerodrome In the development of the models it had been\nabsolutely necessary to develop some efficient automatic control, as\nthey were far too small to carry an aviator, and the conditions of\nflight in the open air, even on the calmest day, were such that\nconstant readjustments of the equilibrium were necessary The success\nattained in the automatic control of the equilibrium of the models had\nbeen so great, and so much time would have been required for an\naviator to acquire skill sufficient to control a machine without such\nautomatic equilibrium, that it was considered both expedient and safe\nto embody in the large aerodrome the plans which had proved so\nsuccessful in the models It was necessary, however, to provide in\naddition in the large machine means whereby the aviator could\n\n\nquickly and accurately either modify the action of the automatic\ndevices or, if desired, entirely supersede the automatic control by\npurely manual control Three distinct problems were, therefore,\nencountered in connection with the equilibrium and control of the\nlarge aerodrome In the first place, the machine as a whole had to be\nso designed, and its component parts so disposed as to secure a highly\nstable initial equilibrium; second, automatic means had to be\nprovided for [p208] maintaining this equilibrium under the varying\nconditions of flight and for restoring it if for any reason it was\ndisturbed, and, finally, provision had to be made for the quick and\naccurate control of the flight by the aviator These problems, while\nintimately related, had to be met one by one and solved separately",
    "These problems, while\nintimately related, had to be met one by one and solved separately The general type of machine adopted was that which had been\ndeveloped in the years of experiment with the steam-driven models From the very first consideration of the large aerodrome, it seemed\nadvisable to follow this type, which not only had shown itself to be\ndistinguished by remarkable longitudinal and lateral stability in the\ntests, but was actually the only type in the world which had at that\ntime shown any possibility of successful flight There was, of course, a\nquestion whether single surface or superposed wings would be used,\nand in spite of the negative results obtained in the tests of the models\nwith the superposed wings, it was felt that a considerable field for\ndevelopment was open in this direction However, in spite of the\nadvantages which theoretical considerations showed might be\nobtained through the introduction of this and various other\nmodifications of the original type, the whole teaching of past\nexperience in the construction of the model aerodromes had been that\nsuccess was more certain to be achieved by following the course in\nwhich genuine practical results had been achieved It was decided,\ntherefore, that in the construction of the large aerodrome the design\nshould follow as closely as constructional conditions would permit the\nlines of the successful model Aerodromes Nos 5 and 6, which have\nalready been fully described The longitudinal stability of an aerodrome is largely dependent\nupon the relation of three chief factors; the center of pressure, the\ncenter of gravity and the line of thrust For an aerodrome of the\n“Langley” type, the relative positions of these which give the greatest\n\n\ndegree of stability had been determined as far as possible through the\nyears of experiment with the models However, while it is the usual\nexperience in designing machinery, or even scientific apparatus, that\nwhat appears theoretically to be the best plan has to be considerably\nmodified for constructional reasons, yet in the design of an aerodrome\nthis is particularly true, for not only must all the various parts\nfunction properly, both separately and as a whole, but this result must\nbe secured for the very minimum of weight Experience alone can\nenable one to appreciate thoroughly how seriously this consideration\nof weight complicates the problem In making the original designs for the large aerodrome it had been\nrecognized that the relative positions of the line of thrust, center of\npressure, and center of gravity were much better in model No 6 than\nin model No 5 From Data Sheet No 1, for Aerodrome No 5 when it\nmade its flight on May 6, 1896, it will be noted that the line of thrust\nbeing assumed to be at the point 1500,43 [p209] the center of gravity\nwas at the point 1497, and that, assuming the rear wings to have two-\nthirds of the lifting effect of the front ones, the center of pressure was\ncalculated to be at the point 1498, or one centimetre in front of the\ncenter of gravity, measured in the horizontal plane In the vertical\nplane the center of pressure was calculated to be at the point 2536,\nand the center of gravity was found by test to be at the point 2501,\nwhen the line of thrust was assumed to be at the point 2500, the\ncenter of gravity being actually one centimetre above the line of\nthrust From the data sheet of Aerodrome No 6, for its flight of November\n28, 1896, it will be noted that the line of thrust being at the point\n1500 the center of pressure was at the point 1487, and the center of\ngravity at the point 1484; that is, the center of pressure was three\ncentimeters in front of the center of gravity, measured in the\nhorizontal plane In the vertical plane, taking the line of thrust at the\npoint 2500, the center of pressure was at the point 2525, and the\ncenter of gravity at the point 2486, the center of gravity being 14\ncentimetres below the line of thrust and 39 centimetres below the\ncenter of pressure, the distance from the center of pressure to the line\nof thrust being, therefore, 64 per cent of the distance between the\ncenter of pressure and the center of gravity As has been explained in Part I, while it is not desirable that the\ncenter of gravity be a great distance below the center of pressure, as\nsuch a relation tends to produce a special kind of rolling and pitching\nin varying currents of air, it is highly desirable that the center of\ngravity should lie some distance below the line of thrust in order that\nthe three forces may be balanced In a machine like model No 5,\nwhere the center of gravity was actually, though very slightly above\nthe line of thrust, there is a constant tendency to produce rotation of\nthe aerodrome, if for any reason its equilibrium is disturbed, which is\ncorrected in practice by the action of the Pénaud tail In model No 6,\non the other hand, the disposition of the three factors was such that\nthey tended to maintain, rather than to destroy, the initial equilibrium\nof the machine These desirable relative positions had been made possible in model\nNo 6 by the fact that the center of gravity and line of thrust could be\nlocated at practically any desired point, since with the use of steam\nthe power plant consists of two separable parts, the boiler, with its\nfuel and water tanks, and the engine These parts can, therefore, be\nplaced in any part of the aerodrome that constructional or theoretical\nreasons demand Furthermore, the engine constitutes such a relatively\nsmall portion of the weight of the entire machine that, if for any\nreason it is desirable to place the engine in the same plane as the line\nof thrust, its weight is not sufficient to alter materially the position of\nthe center of gravity, since the boiler, water and fuel tanks can be\nplaced as low as desirable and connected with the engine by suitable\npipes [p210]\nWith a gasoline engine, however, the conditions are very greatly\naltered Here the engine constitutes practically the entire weight of\nthe power plant, only such accessories as the ignition coil, batteries,\nand carburetor being available for lowering the center of gravity,\nunless the fuel, cooling water tanks and radiator be placed below the\nengine and the liquids forced up by means of a pump In making the\nfirst designs for the large aerodrome, therefore, it was found that it\nwould be practically impossible to make the relative positions of the\ncenter of gravity and line of thrust the same as had existed in model\nNo",
    "In making the\nfirst designs for the large aerodrome, therefore, it was found that it\nwould be practically impossible to make the relative positions of the\ncenter of gravity and line of thrust the same as had existed in model\nNo 6, however desirable it might be The center of gravity could be\nbrought appreciably lower than the line of thrust only by placing the\n\n\ngasoline engine in a plane considerably below that of the propellers,\nand this necessitated the addition of at least two more sets of gears\nwith heavy bearings and braces Besides this almost prohibitive factor\nof weight, it was also foreseen that great difficulty would be\nexperienced in keeping even the two sets of bevel gears already\nnecessary aligned and in proper condition for efficiently transmitting\nthe power to the propellers unless the frame and other parts were\nmade prohibitively heavy It was, therefore, found necessary to bring\nthe center of gravity practically in the same plane with the line of\nthrust, which made its general features as regards equilibrium more\nnearly resemble those of model No 5 than of No 6 The weight of the aviator, it is true, constituted an appreciable part\nof the flying weight of the large machine, and it at first seemed\npossible to lower the center of gravity by placing him at a\nconsiderable distance below the line of thrust But it was recognized\nfrom the beginning that the aviator would probably have to give a\ngreat deal of attention to any form of engine in order to insure its\nworking properly, and his position must, therefore, be selected with a\nview to the proper supervision of the engine and without regard to its\neffect on the center of gravity Although the repeated successful flights of model No 5 under\nvarying conditions of wind and power inspired the belief that the\nminor adjustments, as well as the general plan of the large aerodrome,\nwere such as to give highly stable equilibrium, nevertheless, more\ndirect corroboration of this opinion was desired, and it was largely for\nthis reason that the quarter-size model was constructed In it every\ndetail of the larger machine which in any way affected its equilibrium\nwas exactly reproduced to scale, and the greatest care was taken that\nthe same relative positions of the center of pressure, the center of\ngravity and the line of thrust which it was proposed to employ for the\nlarge aerodrome should be used on the model in its flight of August 8,\n1903, which is later described The entire success of this flight, so far\nas the balancing was concerned, in spite of the fact that the engine\nworked erratically and that the launching speed was much less than it\nshould have been, removed every doubt [p211] that the equilibrium of\nthe large aerodrome would be satisfactory under normal conditions The second problem encountered in connection with the balancing\n\n\nand control of the large aerodrome was that of providing an efficient\nmeans for maintaining the equilibrium under varying atmospheric\nconditions Although much had been done toward the solution of this\nproblem in the development of the models, the whole question was\nreopened and thoroughly reconsidered in designing the large\naerodrome The Pénaud tail, when made elastic or when more or less\nrigid, but attached to the frame through an elastic connection, and\nnormally set at a negative angle, furnishes a means of automatically\ncontrolling the equilibrium, which is sufficiently sensitive and\naccurate to enable a machine to fly for a considerable distance, at\nleast in moderately calm weather, as is evidenced by the various\nflights of the model aerodromes, where there was no human\nintelligence to control them But owing to the principle of action of\nthe Pénaud tail, the flight of an aerodrome controlled by it must of\nnecessity be more or less undulatory in its course Furthermore, the\ntests with the models had indicated that, while the Pénaud tail served\nremarkably well as a means of controlling the equilibrium of the\nmachine, provided the balancing had been rather accurately\ndetermined, and, further, provided nothing happened to affect\nseriously the equilibrium of the machine, it was limited in its\neffectiveness by its narrow range of action It was thought that a\ncontrol mechanism which should be more sensitive and at the same\ntime should act more powerfully to prevent the upsetting of the\nequilibrium when the machine was subjected to rather strong\ndisturbing forces was desirable for any machine which was to\ntransport a human being and, therefore, involved the risk of a fatal\naccident In the earlier period of the work and before the correct application\nof the Pénaud tail to the model aerodromes had been found, Mr Langley had planned a large number of different forms of automatic\ncontrol for preserving the equilibrium of the machines The more\nfrequently recurring of these were devices for changing the angle of\nthe wings or tail, and others for shifting the wings or tail bodily so as\nto shift the position of the center of pressure with respect to the center\nof gravity, the motive power for operating the devices being in some\ncases that derived from a gyroscope or a pendulum, and in others\nsmall electric motor apparatus controlled by a pendulum or a\n\n\ngyroscope Most of these, however, never reached the stage of\ndevelopment where they were actually tried on the machines in flight,\nas the tests of some of them in the shop showed that they were\nunreliable, while others were abandoned either when partly built or\nwhen only the drawings for them had been made Among the better-\npreserved models of devices for this purpose which were in existence\nwhen the writer became associated with the work are those shown in\nPlate 68, [p212] where the piece at the top is a pendulum (inverted or\ndirect) which controls the movement of the horizontal tail by means\nof the cords and apparatus shown, actuating these through the small\nelectro magnets and apparatus attached Just below the rod, which\nrepresents a piece of the midrod, are three parts, the first of which is a\ngroup of six little batteries clustered in a circle, while next to it is a\nsystem of needles hung in gymbals, with electro-steering apparatus in\ncups which itself turns on a graduated base, these electric\nconnections, together with the battery, controlling the vertical rudder On the right of this is another piece of apparatus for actuating\nwindlass cylinders which turn one way or the other as the contact is\nmade by one side or the other of the pendulum or the needle At the\nbottom, on the two rods, is a tail-piece which automatically throws\nthe center of pressure forward or backward according as the\naerodrome departs one way or the other from the horizontal In spite of the fact that all the early attempts of Mr Langley to\ndevise such a mechanical control had been very unsatisfactory, the\nidea that something of this kind was necessary had never really been\nabandoned by him Here was to be seen one of his chief\ncharacteristics, which was never to abandon any idea that seemed\nvaluable until it was brought to a successful issue or some very strong\nproof was developed that the idea was impracticable While on a trip\nabroad during the summer of 1899, and especially while resting at\nVallombrosa, Italy, Mr Langley’s mind again turned to this problem,\nand he wrote a number of very interesting letters emphasizing the\nimportance of devising such a mechanism which should be controlled\nby gravity When he returned to the Institution in the fall he insisted\nupon the same idea",
    "When he returned to the Institution in the fall he insisted\nupon the same idea PL 68 AUTOMATIC EQUILIBRIUM DEVICES ◊\n\n\nFIG 1\nFIG 2\nPL 69 69 MECHANISM OF CONTROL ◊ lgr\nA mechanism which had been devised by the writer for another, but\nsomewhat similar, purpose seemed to be well adapted to this end, and\nit was accordingly decided to construct a small model of such a size as\nwould be suitable for use on one of the steam-driven models The plan\nof control which it was proposed to follow was to have some\nmechanism which would control the angle of the tail through the\naction of gravity on a pendulum bob Since it would require an\nexceedingly heavy pendulum should the deflections of it be directly\nutilized to produce corresponding movements of the tail, the most\nfeasible plan seemed to be to have a light pendulum, which, while\nfree to move under the action of gravity, would nevertheless by its\nmovement cause some outside force to produce corresponding and\nsimultaneous movements of the tail The general scheme of\narrangement is shown in Plate 69, Figs 1 and 2 This device consists\nessentially of a cylinder (1) in which is mounted a piston with the\npiston rod (3) passing through the cylinder head and connected to the\ncord (5) which passes over the pulley (6), fastened to the tube (2),\nwhich is slidably mounted on the midrod (7), whence it is carried\nover the pulley (8) on the guy-post (9) From here it is connected to\nthe spring (10) which is fastened by the [p213] bridle (11) to the upper\nside of the Pénaud tail (12) The other end of the piston rod (3) passes\nthrough the head in the other end of the cylinder, and has connected\nto it a cord (14) which passes over the pulley (15) fastened to the tube\n(2), whence it is continued over the pulley (16) and is joined to the\nspring (17), which is connected by the bridle (18) to the lower side of\nthe tail Mounted on top of the cylinder (1) is a valve chamber (20)\nhaving ports leading to the two ends of the cylinder Mounted in the\nvalve chamber is a rocking valve surrounded by a bushing having\nports in it, and to which is fastened a rod (25) which passes through\nthe said valve and the head of the valve chamber Fastened to the rod\n(25) of the bushing is a lever (26), which by means of the link (27) is\nconnected to the piston rod (3) Fastened to the rocking valve is a rod\n(28) which telescopes over the rod (25) and also passes through the\n\n\nsame head of the valve chamber, and carries at its outer end a\npendulum (29) on the lower end of which is the bob (30) If steam or any other fluid under pressure is furnished to the valve\nchamber through the pipe (31), none will be admitted to the cylinder\nso long as the pendulum is vertical or at right angles to the axis of the\ncylinder; and the tail will be in its normal position, which we will\nsuppose to be an upward inclination of five degrees If, now, the front\nof the machine be depressed, thereby causing the pendulum to move\nto the right, such movement of the pendulum will cause the valve to\nopen, admitting fluid to the left-hand end of the cylinder This, acting\non the piston, will force it towards the right, which, by means of the\ncord, will cause the angle of the tail to be increased, thereby causing\nthe rear of the machine to be depressed and the front to be raised But\nas soon as the piston begins to move under the action of the fluid\npressure it simultaneously moves the bushing which surrounds the\nvalve by means of the connecting links and levers, so that as soon as\nthe piston has moved a distance proportional to the amount that the\nvalve has been opened by the pendulum, it causes the bushing to shut\noff the port and thus prevents further fluid entering the cylinder As\nsoon as the aerodrome responds to the action of the tail the pendulum\nwill, of course, begin to move back to its normal position of\nperpendicularity to the cylinder, and will then open the valve to the\nother port, thereby causing fluid to pass into the opposite end of the\ncylinder This fluid acting on the piston will move it in the opposite\ndirection and thereby cause the tail to be drawn back to its normal\nposition at the same time that the pendulum gradually reaches its\nnormal position, owing to the return of the aerodrome to its normal\nposition In the explanation given above it was assumed that the\nslidable tube (2) was in a fixed position It was planned to have the\nequilibrium normally maintained automatically and at the same time\npermit the operator to modify the automatic control and even to\nassume full manual control To secure this, the slidable tube (2) was\nconnected at each end to an [p214] endless cord (20) which after\npassing over suitable pulleys was connected to the control wheel (51)\nat the aviator’s car A model of this device was constructed in the spring of 1900 and\nwas tested with steam pressure in the shop The test showed that the\n\n\ndevice acted immediately and with precision, the piston performing\nmovements simultaneously and in exact accordance with the\npendulum The device, however, was never tried in a flight of any of\nthe aerodromes owing to the lack of time necessary to properly install\nit on the machine Furthermore, it was thought probable that the\nrapid acceleration of the aerodrome at the moment of launching\nwould so disturb the pendulum as to cause it to be in a very different\nposition from that of vertical, and also that the motion of the\naerodrome through the air would itself be a somewhat disturbing\nfactor Because of the difficulties involved in this or any other mechanical\ndevice for controlling the equilibrium, it was in every way advisable\nto retain in the large machine the Pénaud system, which, though itself\nimperfect in many ways, had been thoroughly tested in actual flight In the models, it will be remembered, the combined Pénaud tail and\nrudder controlled the longitudinal equilibrium by movement in the\nvertical plane under the combined influence of its initial negative\nangle and the elasticity of its connection with the frame, the flight\nbeing kept as nearly as possible in a straight line by the vertical\nsurfaces of the tail Although it was necessary that the large\naerodrome should be capable of being steered in a horizontal\ndirection, it was felt to be unwise to give the combined Pénaud tail\nand rudder motion in the horizontal plane in order to attain this end,\nsince the use of it for such a double function might very seriously\ninterfere with its proper action in preserving the longitudinal stability It was, therefore, at first thought best to dissociate the rudder and tail\nso that the rudder might be used for horizontal steering without in\nany way interfering with the proper functioning of the tail But, as the\nmain desideratum was to obtain a flight of the large machine as soon\nas possible, and perfection of steering control seemed secondary, it\nwas decided, after further consideration, in order not to risk the\nunpredictable effects that might result from small changes, to\nduplicate on the large machine the combined Pénaud tail and rudder\nof the model, and to add another rudder for steering in the horizontal\nplane Constructional requirements determined as the only available\nposition for this rudder a rather disadvantageous one As will be seen\nfrom Plate 53, its efficiency was diminished by its being only about\n\n\nhalf as far from the center of gravity as the combined Pénaud tail and\nrudder, and by being located in the lee of a considerable portion of\nthe frame, where it would be subject to the cross-currents of air\ncreated by the forward motion of the frame [p215]\nFor the preservation of the equilibrium of the aerodrome, though\nthe aviator might assist by such slight movements as he was able to\nmake in the limited space of the aviator’s car, the main reliance was\nupon the Pénaud tail But, in the absence of any data for determining\nthe effect produced in passing from the model to the large machine, it\ncould not be certain that calculations based upon the balancing of the\nmodel would accurately determine the proper balancing of the large\nmachine It was therefore decided to provide such attachment for the\nPénaud tail that, while it would always have elastic connection with\nthe main frame, yet its angle could be appreciably changed without\naffecting in any way the degree of elasticity of this connection After\nmany changes in plans for securing this result, it was finally decided\nto arrange it in the manner shown in the drawings Referring to the\ngeneral plans in Plates 53 and 54, and to the details in Fig 1 of Plate\n56, the main stem of the Pénaud tail is seen to be connected by a pin\nto the horn (17), which is brazed to the clamping thimble, by which it\nis mounted on the vertical tube (16), suitably connected and braced to\nthe rear end of the midrod, the horn (17) being larger than the stem\nof the tail and set at an angle to the vertical tube (16), the pin\nconnection permitting the tail to swing up and down The bridle (40),\nconnected to the center of the tail on its upper side, passes upward\nwhere it is connected to the spring (41), the other end of which is\nconnected to a single wire rope (42), which passes over the pulley\nmounted on the top of the post (43), which is guyed to the upper guy-\npost by the wire (44) The wire rope (42), after passing over the\npulley, is connected to the spring (45), around the two ends of which\nit forms a loop, and from there it passes down to the plane of the\nmain frame and through suitable pulley blocks to the aviator’s control\nwheel (50), which is mounted on the starboard side of the main\nframe, convenient to the aviator’s right hand when he is facing\nforward From this point the wire rope passes through the various\npulley blocks towards the rear of the machine, and through the pulley\nblock (46) mounted on the side and near the bottom of the rear lower\n\n\nguy-post At a short distance beyond this pulley it is connected to a\nweaker spring (47), the other end of which is connected by a second\nbridle (48) to the under side of the Pénaud tail at its center In order\nto prevent the springs (41), (45) and (47), which furnish the elasticity\nfor the Pénaud-tail connection, from being strained beyond their\nelastic limit, either by a sudden gust of wind or by the aviator\nattempting to move so large an area of surface too suddenly, the wire\nrope (42) was made continuous around the springs, the portion\nbetween the points where it was joined to the two ends of the springs\nbeing made of such a length as to take the entire strain should the\nstrain on the cord become greater than sufficient to stretch the springs\n50 per cent of their original length [p216]\nIn the construction of the equilibrium control wheel it was decided\nthat some arrangement must be secured whereby the wheel would\nnormally be inactive and maintain whatever position it had been set\nto, and at the same time could be moved by the aviator with one\nhand, the mere act of grasping it rendering it free to be moved, and\nwhereby it must automatically lock itself in any position in which it\nmight be when the aviator removed his hand from it The multiplicity\nof things requiring the attention of the aviator made it desirable that\nhis attention to any one of the important details, whether the engine,\nthe equilibrium, or the steering, should never require more than one\nhand, thus leaving the other hand free either to hold on to the\nmachine or to control some other detail at the same time While an\nirreversible wheel, such as would be secured by the use of a worm\nand worm-wheel, at first seemed likely to answer the purpose, yet the\nmovement of a worm-wheel by means of a worm is necessarily very\nslow if it is irreversible, and it here seemed desirable to so arrange the\nwheel that in case of emergency, of for rising or descending, the\naviator could swing the Pénaud tail from its extreme upper position to\nits extreme lower one by a small motion of his hand, and thus small or\nlarge adjustments of the Pénaud tail could be intuitively felt to have\nbeen produced without the aviator having to remember how many\nturns he had made of the wheel The control of the steering rudder was effected by a steering wheel\n(51) similar in construction to the equilibrium control wheel (50), a\ncontinuous cord (52) passing from the steering wheel through suitable\n\n\npulleys to either side of the steering rudder (r), springs being\ninterposed in loops in the cord on either side of the steering rudder to\ngive some elasticity to the control apparatus in order to prevent\npossible danger from the aviator attempting to move the rudder too\nsuddenly This steering rope passed directly through the steering\nrudder at the points where it was joined to it; so that, should one side\nof the cord in any way become entangled with the frame or with its\npulleys, the strain produced by the aviator in attempting to move it in\nthe opposite direction would be taken up by the cord and thereby\navoid the possibility of destroying the rudder For even should the\ncord become entangled on one side, the rudder could be given a slight\namount of adjustment through the elasticity of the coiled springs The design of the combined Pénaud tail and rudder followed very\nclosely that which had been used for the models, and its area of\nninety-five square feet on the horizontal surface with a corresponding\narea of vertical surface bore the same relation to the area of the tail\nand rudder of the models that the area of the wings of the large\nmachine bore to that of the wings of its prototype While the provisions for automatic equilibrium and manual control\nwere not entirely ideal, even for the quiet atmospheric conditions\nunder which it [p217] was proposed to make the first tests,\nnevertheless it was and still is believed that the provisions for such\nconditions were sufficient to enable a successful flight of a few miles\nto be obtained It was thought to be very certain that, once a\nsuccessful flight could be made, the funds for the further prosecution\nof the work would be readily forthcoming, and that when these funds\nwere obtained the many problems of control, rising and alighting,\ncould be undertaken ◊\n[p218]\nCHAPTER VIII\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL ENGINE\nIt will be recalled that the contract for the engine for the large\naerodrome, which had been entered into on December 12, 1898,\ncalled for its completion on February 28, 1899 Between the time\nwhen the engine should have been completed and May, 1900, the\nengine builder had been engaged in a continuous series of changes on\nit, all connected with what might be briefly called its proper\nfunctioning The actual mechanical construction of the more\nimportant parts had been admirably executed, and this main portion\nof the constructional work had been completed within the time called\nfor by the contract The trouble was that the engine, which was of the\nrotary cylinder type, would not furnish anything like the power which\nhad been expected of it, and which the size and number of its\ncylinders indicated that it should furnish No one who has not had\npractical experience in the development of gasoline engines, can\nunderstand or appreciate how fourteen months could be spent in\nchanges in the minor details of the engine with the expectation that\neach contemplated change would bring success; and to anyone who\nhas had experience in the matter, an attempt to explain the delays\nwould merely seem like a history of his own experiences It is,\ntherefore, sufficient to say that the delay on the engine had now\nreached a point where it was necessary to bring it to a successful\ncompletion immediately or to abandon it definitely, and either find a\ncompetent builder who had already built engines which, while not\nnecessarily light, were successful, and who would undertake to\nconstruct a light one on the same principles, or, as a last resort, to\nturn to steam; and even the contemplation of this was appalling On May 6, 1900, the writer went to New York to see what could be\ndone towards assisting the engine builder to complete the large engine\nand also, if possible, the small one which had been ordered for the\nquarter-size model later described He immediately made brake tests\nof the engine to determine accurately just what effects were being\nproduced by the different changes the engine builder was making Upon the first test the engine was found to develop only 2 83 horse-\npower, and this could not be maintained for more than a few minutes,\nwhen without any apparent cause and without any signs of\noverheating the engine would altogether cease to develop any power After remaining in New York for several weeks, during which time\nmany changes were made in the engine, he finally got it to the point\nwhere it would develop four horse-power continuously; but, as it\nseemed impossible to get any better results [p219] without an\nindefinite amount of experiment, it was decided that all hope of\nmaking this engine an immediate success would have to be\nabandoned Interest in the development of the automobile was increasing at a\nrapid rate all over the world, and while the builders in this country\nhad not reached the stage of development which had been attained in\nEurope, especially in France, yet some American builders had\nsucceeded in constructing cars propelled by gasoline engines which\ncould be depended upon to run at least a short distance, and it was,\ntherefore, hoped that some one of the more competent of these\nbuilders might be found who would undertake to construct a suitable\nengine After making a most extensive but fruitless search for such a\nbuilder in this country, it was decided that it would be best to see\nwhat could be done in Europe, and as other administrative matters\nmade it necessary for Mr Langley to go to Europe about the middle of\nJune, the writer accompanied him to see what could be done towards\nhaving a suitable engine built there Some six weeks were spent in\nvisiting all the important builders of gasoline engines in Europe, and\nthe results were very discouraging Everywhere the builders said that\nthey did not care to undertake the work, and that they did not\nconsider it possible to construct an engine of 12 horse-power\nweighing less than 100 to 150 kilograms (220 to 330 lbs ), or that, if\nthey had thought it possible, they would already have built it, as they\nhad had numerous inquiries for such engines, and also wanted them\nfor their own use The last hope of securing a suitable gasoline engine\nseemed to have vanished But, discouraging as was the refusal of the engine builders of\nEurope to undertake to build the engine, and still more so their\nopinion that such an engine was an impossibility, inspection of the\n\n\nengines exhibited at the Paris Exposition had so strengthened the\nwriter’s conviction of the possibility of the undertaking that, before\nparting with Mr Langley on August 3 to return to America, he\npersonally assumed the responsibility of building an engine which\nwould meet the requirements Upon returning from Europe on August 13, and finding that the\nengine builder in New York had made no progress whatever towards\nimproving the engine during his absence, the writer condemned both\nthe large engine and the small one The engine builder had practically\nbankrupted himself in his attempts to construct these two engines,\nhaving spent something like $8000 or $10,000 in actual wages over\nand above the contract prices for the engines, to say nothing of\nremuneration for his own time or such expenses as shop rent and\npower As all of the money for the large machine and practically all\nfor the small one had been advanced to him at various times to assist\nhim over financial stringencies—such advances, however, having been\nsecured by suitable bonds—it was decided to take the various parts of\nthe two engines in [p220] payment for the money which had been\nadvanced, as it was hoped that some of the parts of the engines might\nprove of use in experimental work Immediately after the writer’s return to Washington he began work\non the development of an engine Taking some of the parts of the\nengine which had been condemned and constructing others, he was\nable by September 18 to have an experimental engine at work which,\nwhile not water-jacketed, but provisionally cooled by wrapping wet\ncloths around the cylinders, developed\n18\n1\n2\nhorse-power on the Prony brake at 715 R P M , the engine, including\nthese wet cloths, weighing 108 pounds Of course these wet cloths\nsufficed to keep the engine cool for only a short time—three to four\nminutes being the maximum This was only a temporary expedient for\nenabling the engine to run for a sufficient time to make brake tests\nand determine the power it developed, but the results obtained were\nso very encouraging that it was decided to make water jackets for the\ncylinders of this engine and see what power it would then develop for\nmore extended periods This experimental engine, which was merely a “patched-up” affair,\nwas first equipped with a sparking arrangement built on the wiping-\ncontact principle With this sparking arrangement several important\ndifficulties presented themselves, among which may be particularly\nmentioned the great difficulty of so adjusting the sparking\narrangements that the explosion in each cylinder occurred at exactly\nthe same point in its cycle that the explosions occurred in all the other\ncylinders, it being necessary to secure this result to a reasonably\naccurate degree in order to cause the engine to run smoothly enough\nto be used in the aerodrome Where an engine has a large and heavy\nfly-wheel running at a high rate of speed, the nicety of adjustment of\nthe sparking arrangement is not so essential, for the fly-wheel acts as\na reservoir of energy and tends to smooth out the rough and jerky\nimpulses which would be otherwise introduced by slight variations in\nthe force of the explosions in the cylinders In constructing an engine\nfor an aerodrome, however, the permissible weight of the engine is so\nvery small that the use of a fly-wheel having sufficient weight to act\nas an energy reservoir is practically prohibited Another serious\ndifficulty which was encountered with the wiping-contact type of\nsparking arrangement was that of keeping the stuffing boxes around\nthe rotating contact rods tight enough to prevent leakage, without at\nthe same time binding and causing excessive friction Although it\nseemed probable that the difficulties which have been mentioned, and\nother minor ones which were apparent, could be remedied by further\nexperiment, yet the high tension or “jump-spark” type of sparking\napparatus seemed to offer much greater advantages Since it had\nfewer moving parts, and furthermore since the wiping-contact\nsparking arrangement would have to be considerably modified in\norder to permit the construction of water jackets around the cylinders,\nit was decided to construct a [p221] new sparking arrangement for the\nengine on the jump-spark principle After introducing this change in\nthe engine it was found to run very much more smoothly and to\nrequire a minimum amount of care in adjusting it At the time that this engine was being developed it was practically\nimpossible to obtain any outside information regarding the proper\nway of constructing it The little that was then known had been\nlearned through laborious experience and at great cost by the\n\n\nexperimenters who were attempting to build automobiles, and was\nzealously guarded in the hope of preventing their rivals from utilizing\nthe results of their labors It was the known custom, however, of all\nengine builders at this time to use a separate spark coil and a separate\ncontact maker for each cylinder of an engine, no matter how many\ncylinders there were This multiplication of the spark coils, which at\nthat time were very heavy, not only added greatly to the weight but\nalso had the same defect that the wipe-spark type of sparking\narrangement had of being exceedingly difficult to so adjust that all of\nthe contact makers would perform their functions at exactly the same\npoint in the cycle for each cylinder To obviate these difficulties, both\nof adjustment and of excessive weight, the writer devised what is\nsupposed to have been at that time a new and valuable multiple-\nsparking arrangement whereby only one battery, one coil and one\ncontact maker were utilized for causing the spark in all five cylinders,\na small commutating arrangement in the high-tension circuit\ndistributing the sparks to the proper cylinders at the proper time This\nform of sparking arrangement was found upon test to work so\nsatisfactorily that it was afterwards adopted for the small engine of\nthe quarter-size model, and also for the new and larger engine which\nwas afterwards built and which will be described further on It is\nneedless to describe in detail the many and perplexing difficulties\nwhich were experienced in procuring suitable spark coils, spark plugs\nand other appurtenances of the sparking apparatus, all of which at\nthis time were in a very crude state of development, there being only\na few different makes on the market, and most of these being very\nunsatisfactory One important minor improvement connected with the\nspark plugs may be described, as the beneficial effect produced by it\nwas so very great that its use was continued in all future spark plugs\nfor all of the engines This improvement, however, is now\nincorporated in many of the plugs which are on the market, and in\nsome cases patents, covering the particular form in which the\nimprovement is incorporated, are exploited by the manufacturer Considerable difficulty was at first experienced with the spark plugs\nfrom a coating of soot (resulting from the incomplete combustion of\nthe gas and oil in the cylinder at the time of explosion) which formed\non the porcelain and thereby caused a short-circuit, preventing the\n\n\nplug from working properly This was overcome by extending the\nmetal portion of the plug for some distance into the cylinder, and for\nsomething like three-quarters of an [p222] inch beyond the end of the\nporcelain insulator The terminal which passed through the insulator\nwas also extended for something like half an inch beyond the\nporcelain and bent to a proper extent to co-act with a piece of\nplatinum wire inserted in the interior wall of the plug which formed\nthe other terminal After making this improvement in the plugs\npractically no difficulty was experienced from short-circuits caused by\nthe soot In making the tests of this experimental engine it was found\npractically impossible to absorb the power by a Prony brake in a\nsufficiently uniform manner on account of the fact that the engine was\nbeing run without a fly wheel The consequent variation in the torque\nand speed during each revolution caused such great fluctuations in the\nreading of the scales which measured the pull of the Prony brake that\nno confidence could be felt in the accuracy of the readings and,\ntherefore, no confidence could be placed in the determinations of the\neffect which different changes in the engine produced A water-\nabsorption dynamometer consisting of a number of flat, circular discs\nfastened to a shaft and rotating between other parallel flat discs\narranged in a circular drum which was filled to any desired extent\nwith water was immediately planned, and the construction of two of\nthem was begun so that power could be taken from both ends of the\nengine shaft, which, on account of its necessary lightness, was apt to\nbe injured by being twisted when all the power was taken from one\nend of the shaft In order to continue the tests on the engine while this\ndynamometer was being made it was decided to employ one of the\npropellers as a dynamometer Although no accurate tests had been\nmade to determine just how much power was required to drive these\npropellers at various speeds, yet the fundamental law was known that\nunder the same conditions the power required to drive any propeller\nwould vary as the cube of the number of revolutions, and since the\nProny-brake tests had given an approximation as to the amount of\npower which the engine developed at certain speeds, the law of the\npropeller, and extrapolations from the data obtained in the tests of the\nsmaller propellers in 1898, enabled further approximations to be\n\n\nmade as to the amount of extra power which the engine developed\nwhen certain changes enabled it to drive the propeller at increased\nspeeds This method had also the great advantage that, since the\npower required varies as the cube of the number of revolutions, it is\npractically impossible for the engine to “run away” with the propeller\nand cause serious damage through the possible excessive strains\nintroduced by high speed This feature is also possessed by water-\nabsorption dynamometers of the type which were built and used in\nthe later tests The construction of water jackets for this engine proved an\nexceedingly formidable task, it being impossible to braze the jackets\ndirectly to the walls of the cylinders without risk of ruining them It\ntherefore became necessary to attach them by means of stuffing boxes,\nwhich, on account of their large size [p223] and the necessity for\nkeeping the weight a minimum, was a most difficult piece of work The work was rendered still more difficult by the fact that the water\njackets had to be made in halves which were brazed together after\nthey had been fitted over the head of the cylinder Even when the\nwork was done in the most careful way this method of construction\ngave a great deal of trouble from the leaking of the stuffing boxes or\nthe jackets themselves However, after much delay, the water jackets\nwere finally completed, and upon test the engine was found to\ndevelop 21 5 horse-power at 825 R P M , the engine itself weighing\n120 pounds Further changes were made in this engine, especially in the pistons,\na new set of which were constructed which weighed 15 pounds less\nthan the original set On account of the difficulty with the leakage of\nthe water around the stuffing boxes of the water jackets, and also\nfrom imperfections in the brazed joints of the jackets themselves, it\nwas found impossible to rely on the power that the engine would\ndevelop at any particular time, as the water leaking from the jackets\nand running down on the spark plugs of the lower cylinders caused\nthese cylinders to work erratically, and this not only materially\nreduced the power but also caused jerky impulses in the absence of fly\nwheels It seemed so desirable to obtain as soon as possible a first test in\nactual flight of the large machine that the writer offered to put this\n\n\nengine in the aerodrome frame and make a test with it if the machine\nwere launched over the water, but with the launching track mounted\ndirectly on the river bank However, Mr Langley felt it so necessary\nto make the initial test from the top of the house-boat and at an\nelevation of 30 feet or more that he would not consent to this, and as\nthe engine at its best did not develop quite 24 horse-power, which\nhad been calculated as the minimum which should be provided, it was\nthought unwise to attempt to make the first test from the top of the\nhouse-boat until the aerodrome had been provided with engines that\ncould be depended on to develop continuously not less than 24 horse-\npower It then became necessary either to build a duplicate engine and use\nboth of them in the aerodrome, the original plan as already explained\nhaving been to have two engines developing the 24 horse-power\ntogether; or, second, to construct an entirely new engine large enough\nto furnish a minimum of 24 horse-power and use this single engine As the construction and tests of this experimental engine had shown\nmany places in which the weight might be safely reduced, the writer\ndecided to construct an entirely new and larger single engine, and\nthereby avoid the extra weight and difficulties which would be\nintroduced by having to use synchronizing gears where two engines\nwere used, it being impossible, of course, to run the two propellers\nfrom the two engines independently without risk of serious disaster [p224]\nIt will be recalled that when the aerodrome was originally planned\nin 1898 it was proposed to have two engines of 12 horse-power each,\nand the contract for the single engine of 12 horse-power provided that\na duplicate was to be supplied, if desired, immediately upon the\ncompletion and delivery of the first one The calculations, both from\nthe whirling-table tests and from the results with the steam-driven\nmodels in actual flight, indicated that 24 horse-power would be ample\nfor the aerodrome, which it was then expected would not exceed 640\npounds in weight, with a supporting surface of 960 square feet But it\nwas found that the total weight of the machine was rapidly increasing\non account of slight increases in the various details, which when\nadded together made a considerable increase in weight Furthermore,\nas it had been found difficult to keep all five of the cylinders of the\n\n\nexperimental engine working uniformly, it was thought best to build\nthis new engine sufficiently large to provide not only the extra power\nnecessary because of the increased weight of the aerodrome, but also\nto provide for further inevitable increases in weight, and over and\nabove all this, to provide also that the engine would furnish all the\npower necessary, even though one of its cylinders should absolutely\nfail to work and act as a dead load on the others The writer\naccordingly designed this new engine to give 40 horse-power when all\nfive of the cylinders were working, and 28 horse-power even though\none cylinder should act as a dead load on the others The various materials for the construction of this engine were\nordered early in December, 1900, with the promise of delivery not\nlater than January, 1901 Owing to various causes, however, the\nmajor portion of the materials could not be obtained until late in the\nspring, and, in fact, a portion of them were not obtained until the\nsummer of 1901 During this period of delay, however, the engine for\nthe quarter-size model was completely reconstructed and further tests\nwere made with the experimental engine in developing accessories,\nsuch as carburetors and spark coils The float-feed type of carburetor which was then coming into\nprominence in automobile work proved at that stage of its\ndevelopment to be totally unsuitable, as the slight but constant tremor\nof the aerodrome frame, when the engine was working at high speeds\nunder a heavy load, caused the float to act as a pump and periodically\nflood the carburetor This resulted in an irregularity of action of the\nengine which at times injured not only the transmission shafts, gears,\nand frame, but the engine itself by the serious pounding which\noccurred A form was next tried in which the gasoline was fed in\nthrough the valve seat of a lightly loaded valve which raised\nwhenever there was suction in the inlet pipe, the amount of gasoline\nfed being regulated by a pin valve Later there were built several\nshapes and sizes of tanks filled with absorbent material, which was\nsaturated with gasoline and the surplus drawn off before starting the\nengine Some of these tanks were provided with a jacket through\nwhich [p225] a portion of the exhaust gases was passed in order to\ncompensate for the cooling of the tank caused by the evaporation of\nthe gasoline As a result of these tests it was found that a type\n\n\nconsisting essentially of a tank filled with small lumps of a porous\ncellular wood (tupelo wood) which was initially saturated with\ngasoline, and into which the gasoline was fed through a distributing\npipe as rapidly as it was taken up by the air, which was sucked\nthrough it by the engine, gave the best results Instead of jacketing\nthis tank, the cooling effect due to evaporation was compensated by\ndrawing the somewhat heated air from around the engine cylinders\nup through the loosely packed lumps of wood When tested in the\nshop this type was found to give such a very uniform mixture that the\nengine ran as smoothly and regularly as an electric motor, the\nvibration in no way interfering with it, and even when the sudden\nchange from a state of rest to one of rapid motion through the air was\nimitated by suddenly turning on the carburetor the blast of several\nlarge electric fans from various angles, it was found to have no\nappreciable effect on the running of the engine, thus indicating that\nthe trouble which was experienced with the model aerodrome in the\ntrials of 1901 was not likely to be repeated with the large aerodrome Somewhat more than a dozen carburetors of various forms were\nconstructed before this last type was devised, but this proved so\nsatisfactory that there were never thereafter any carburetor troubles In fact, as will later appear, a carburetor of this type kept the engine\non the large aerodrome running at full power not only when the\naerodrome was in a vertical position in the air, but also after it had\nturned completely over on its back ◊\n[p226]\nCHAPTER IX\nTHE QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME\nOwing to the very considerable changes which constructional\nreasons necessitated in the relative positions of the center of pressure,\ncenter of gravity, and line of thrust from those which theoretical\nconsiderations pointed to as being best, it was decided in January,\n1900, to build a one-quarter-size model of the large aerodrome, if a\nsuitable engine capable of furnishing something like one and a half\nhorse-power could be procured without delay It was hoped that it\nmight be possible to construct this model immediately without\nseriously interfering with the progress of the work on the large\nmachine, and that some tests in free flight could then be made with it,\nwhich would give very much more reliable data from which to\ndetermine the balancing of the large aerodrome than had been\nobtained from the tests of the steam-driven models Nos",
    "It was hoped that it\nmight be possible to construct this model immediately without\nseriously interfering with the progress of the work on the large\nmachine, and that some tests in free flight could then be made with it,\nwhich would give very much more reliable data from which to\ndetermine the balancing of the large aerodrome than had been\nobtained from the tests of the steam-driven models Nos 5 and 6 A\nfactor of uncertainty would still remain, due to the difference in size\nbetween the large machine and the model, which could be determined\nonly by actual trial of the large machine itself; but by making the\nmodel an exact duplicate, on a smaller scale of the large machine,\nvery valuable results could be obtained Tests of it in free flight would\ninvolve, even with the probable attendant breakages, a comparatively\nsmall expenditure of time and money A search was immediately\nbegun for an engine builder who would undertake to furnish a\nsuitable engine for this model The specifications called for an engine\ndeveloping one and a half horse-power on the Prony brake for five\nminutes without diminution in power caused by over heating While it\nwas desired if possible to get an engine which would come within the\ngiven weight and develop the required power for a longer time than\nfive minutes, it was foreseen that the construction of a multiple-\ncylinder engine of so small a power made it necessary to resort to the\nair-cooled type, and that such an engine would be doing exceedingly\nwell to develop its maximum power continuously for as much as five\nminutes The only engine builder who could be found willing to\nundertake the construction of such an engine was the one already\n\n\nengaged in the construction of the larger engine As this builder was\nalready twelve months behind in the delivery of the large engine, it\nwas felt that it would be unwise to give it to him, both because the\nwork on it might still further delay him in the completion of the large\none, and also because he was still having troubles with the large one,\nwhich it was not certain he would ever be able to overcome After\nfurther consideration of the matter, however, it seemed so important\nto have a model which was an exact duplicate of the large machine\nfor the [p227] making of tests, which might prevent not only serious\ndamage but possibly fatal accidents, that upon the assurance of the\nengine builder that the undertaking of the small engine would in no\nway interfere with the completion of the large one, a contract was\nentered into on February 23, 1900, which specified that the engine\nshould be delivered by April 1, with a penalty for any delay beyond\nthat date The frame for this quarter-size model was immediately begun and\nextra workmen were employed for work on it in order that its\nconstruction should in no way delay the completion of the large\nmachine The decision to construct this quarter-size model of the large\naerodrome had been made on the assumption that, since it was to be\none-sixteenth the weight of the large machine, and therefore much\nheavier in comparison to its size than the steam models Nos 5 and 6,\nit would, therefore, not need to be so carefully constructed in order to\nobtain sufficient strength But when construction was actually begun\nit was found not only that the simpler and less expensive methods\nwhich it had been proposed to use in joining its frame together\nresulted in a weak construction, but also that the time consumed in\ntinkering \nup \nthe \nimperfections \nin \nthe \njoints \nmore \nthan\ncounterbalanced the extra time which would have been required to\nmake the joints in the best manner from the beginning Before going\nvery far it was therefore decided to make the joints by following the\nsame process which had been developed in the construction of the\nprevious models The frame was accordingly built in the most\nsubstantial manner, and when guyed by a system of guy-wires similar\nto that employed for the large machine it was found to be exceedingly\nstiff, in fact very much stronger and stiffer than the frame of any of\nthe preceding models In originally planning the model the intention was to make all its\nlinear dimensions exactly one-fourth those of the large aerodrome Before the designs were completed, however, it was seen from the\nprevious experience with the steam-driven models that instead of the\n62 5-cm propellers, which a strict adherence to the quarter-size plan\nwould demand, it would be necessary to use propellers which were at\nleast one metre in diameter Moreover, as the small engine would be\nmore than one-fourth the size of the engine under construction for the\nlarge aerodrome, a departure from the scale in the case of the\ntransverse frame would be necessary The designs were therefore\naltered so as to admit of using the larger propellers, and the tubes\nwhich formed the front of the transverse frame were bent, as shown in\nthe plan photograph, Plate 70, in order to give a large enough space\nfor properly mounting the engine The frame with these modifications was completed in June, 1900,\nbut no engine was ready for it, as the builder had failed to fulfill his\ncontract for either the large or the small engine, although several trips\nto New York had been made to expedite their successful completion [p228]\nSoon after this it became certain that the engines for both\naerodromes would have to be constructed in the shops of the\nInstitution, and owing to the greater importance of the experimental\nengine for the large aerodrome, all the facilities of the shops were\ndevoted to the early completion of it In November, 1900, however, it\nwas seen that the experimental engine alone would not furnish\nsufficient power for the large aerodrome, and that a duplicate of it\nwould have to be built or a new and larger engine designed and\nconstructed, and that therefore it would be impossible to get the first\ntests of the large aerodrome in free flight before the following\nsummer It was therefore decided that it would be best to suspend\nwork temporarily on the large aerodrome and its engine, and put all\nthe workmen who could possibly be employed on the construction of\nthe small engine, so that it would be ready in time to permit some\ntests of the quarter-size model to be made during the following spring In order to expedite its construction as much as possible, the\nattempt was made to utilize all the available parts from the small\nengine which had been undertaken by the engine builder in New\n\n\nYork The cylinders, which it had been expected would be kept cool\nby their rotation around the crank pin, were not well adapted for use\nas stationary cylinders, since they were not provided with radiating\nribs, but it was hoped that by using them an engine could be very\nquickly constructed which would keep cool long enough to enable\nsome short flights to be made with the model The work on this small engine was pushed forward very rapidly, so\nthat within a short time it was sufficiently complete to allow some\npower tests to be made with it In the first of these tests the attempt\nwas made to measure the power by means of the Prony brake, but as\nthe engine had no fly wheel the fluctuations in speed during each\nrevolution were so great as to make it impossible to obtain readings of\nany value When it was attempted to remedy this by putting a fly\nwheel on either side of the crank shaft of the engine, it was found that\nthe sudden starting of the engine caused such severe strains in the\ncrank shaft, which had been built strong enough for driving the\npropellers but not for suddenly starting fly wheels having considerable\ninertia, as to make it unsafe to continue the use of fly wheels As\nwithout them the Prony brake could not be used, it was decided to\nbuild a small water-absorption dynamometer on the same principle as\nthe larger ones which were under construction for the large engine As\nthis larger dynamometer has already been described, it is only\nnecessary to add that the small one consisted of twelve rotating plates\nand twelve stator plates twelve inches in diameter In order to avoid\nthe construction of a special and elaborate testing frame for mounting\nthe engine and the dynamometer exactly in line with each other, it\nwas attempted to connect them by means of a universal joint This\n“short cut” also proved the “long way around ” The strains set up in\nthe universal joint by the sudden starting of [p229] the engine caused\nso much trouble on account of the inertia of the rotating plates of the\ndynamometer that the time lost in keeping the universal joint in\nworking order during the tests more than counterbalanced the extra\ntime which would have been required to construct a special wooden\nframe on which the dynamometer and engine could have been\nmounted in line with each other so that the crank shaft of the engine\ncould have been directly connected to the shaft of the dynamometer Much time was also lost in the effort to construct an apparatus by\n\n\nwhich a record could be obtained of the power actually used in\npropelling the aerodrome Various methods were in use by which the\nthrust of the propellers could be more or less satisfactorily measured\nwhile the aerodrome was at rest, but it was desired to know just how\nmuch power the aerodrome consumed while in actual free flight Such\na record it was hoped to obtain from a device incorporated in the\npropeller shafts This thrust-measuring device consisted essentially of\na propeller shaft made in two sections, one section telescoping the\nother for a short distance On the section of the shaft to which the\npropeller was attached there was mounted a drum, having in its\ncircumference two long slots diametrically opposite To the other\nsection of the shaft a disc was fastened with two diametrically\nopposite rollers mounted on its periphery, which fitted the slots in the\ndrum of the other section A compression spring was interposed\nbetween the disc and the drum, and the outside of the drum was so\narranged that a strip of paper could be wound around and fastened to\nit which would serve as a chronograph sheet A pencil was fastened to\nthe frame, and, since the drum was connected to the section of the\nshaft to which the propeller was attached and which therefore moved\nto and from the frame under the action of the propeller thrust, a\nrecord of the actual thrust of the propeller at any particular moment\ncould be obtained by simply pressing the pencil up against the paper\non the drum and calculating the thrust from the calibration of the\ncompression spring Since the thrust would naturally be greater when\nthe propellers were revolving in a moored condition, during the few\nmoments after the engine was started up and before the aerodrome\nwas launched, it was necessary to provide means for having the pencil\npoint held away from the chronograph sheet until the aerodrome was\nlaunched, and then have the point come to bear on the sheet This\nwas accomplished by having the point held off by a small trigger\narrangement which was to be released just at the moment that the\naerodrome left the launching car A set of propeller shafts embodying\nthis thrust-recording device was constructed, but when they were\nactually tested on the aerodrome many difficulties were encountered\nwhich had not been anticipated In the first place the gasoline engine\nfor the model was started up (or “cranked over”) by turning the\npropellers by hand A gasoline engine never starts slowly, and on\n\n\naccount of this suddenness of starting causes a very great strain in any\n[p230] shafting by which it is connected to any driven mechanism The\ninertia of the driven mechanism, even though it be apparently small,\nbecomes a most serious matter when an attempt is made to start up\nvery suddenly This effect is very much intensified if the driven\nmechanism is connected to the engine through even one pair of gears,\nfor there is always a certain amount of back-lash between the teeth of\nthe gears, and the effect of this back-lash is still further intensified\nwhen the driven mechanism is turned over by hand in order to start\nthe engine, as this takes up the back-lash on one side of the gears, and\nthe moment the engine starts permits a free movement until it\nsuddenly takes up the back-lash and strikes the other side of the gear\nteeth with a blow The effect of this sudden starting of the engine\nproved most disastrous to the thrust-recording devices, and, although\nthey were considerably strengthened, it was found after a short time\nthat in order to make them strong enough to withstand the shock of\nthe sudden starting of the engine it would be necessary to make them\ninordinately heavy It was therefore decided to abandon all attempts\nto incorporate the thrust-recording device on this quarter-size model,\nbut it was hoped to install it later on one of the steam-driven models,\nwhere the engine starts so slowly that there would be no need for\nexcessive strength in it The engine for the quarter model when reconstructed with\nstationary instead of rotating cylinders was found in the shop tests\nreferred to above to develop when working at its best between\n1\n1\n2\nand 2 horse-power, as measured by the absorption dynamometers However, it was impossible to maintain this power steadily for more\nthan 30 seconds In the first place, the same difficulties (heretofore\ndescribed) that were met with in securing a suitable carburetor for the\nexperimental engine were experienced at the same time in the\ndevelopment of the small engine In the second place, as the engine\nhad no cooling apparatus of any kind, it was found that it could not\nbe tested in the shop for more than 30 seconds owing to premature\nexplosions It was hoped, however, that by having everything ready\nfor a flight before starting the engine, it might be possible to launch\n\n\nthe aerodrome before the cylinders began to heat seriously, and that\nthe greatly increased cooling effect due to the motion of the\naerodrome through the air would permit the engine to develop\nsufficient power to secure a flight that would show whether or not the\nbalancing was correct, as the final disposition of some of the\naccessories on the large aerodrome could not be so well settled until it\nwas known just how the calculated balancing of this new model\ncorresponded with the actual balancing necessary for flight On account of Mr Langley’s reliance on the generally sound theory\nthat where a successful method of conducting an experiment has been\nfound only after a long series of failures it is best not to change to\nsome unknown and untried plan, it was impossible, especially where\nfailure in the test might involve a fatal accident, to get him to deviate\nfrom his original plan of [p231] launching the large aerodrome from\nthe top of the house-boat He apparently realized as well as anyone,\nthat in many respects the making of the test from the top of the\nhouse-boat had many serious drawbacks, but he emphasized and\nimpressed on the writer the importance of following as far as possible\nin the construction and test of the large machine, the plans which had\nbrought success with the models Believing, however, that there was\nprobably a better method of launching the aerodrome than from the\ntop of the house-boat, and that it would be well to prepare before\nhand as far as possible for following some other plan of launching\nimmediately after a first successful test had been obtained from the\ntop of the boat, Mr Langley had constructed some floats which were\narranged to be attached to the launching car of the quarter-size model\nso that the car could be converted into a catamaran raft It was not\nbelieved that this crude arrangement would suffice for a complete\nlaunching apparatus, since the power of the aerodrome propellers\nwould not be great enough to force the raft through the water at a\nsufficiently high speed; still it was thought that by having the\nlaunching car arranged in this way the model might be allowed to\ndrive the raft rapidly through the water and thus give some idea as to\nwhat would be necessary, in a more complete launching apparatus, to\nobviate the danger of the drag of the raft causing the model to plunge\nover headlong into the water The launching car with these floats\nattached to it, and with the quarter-size model mounted on the car, is\n\n\nclearly shown in Plates 73 and 74 While the results obtained with superposed wings in the tests of\nmodels Nos 5 and 6 in the summer of 1899 indicated that the “single-\ntier” surfaces were much more efficient, still, as has been already\nstated, the great advantages of the superposed surfaces, so far as\nstrength of construction is concerned, was fully realized at all times As a result of these tests it was decided to use the “single-tier”\nsurfaces in the first test of the large machine in order to insure as far\nas possible the best conditions However, it was from the beginning\nplanned to construct superposed surfaces for use in the later tests of\nthe large machine; and, in order to obtain more reliable data on such\nsurfaces than had been obtained in the tests of the models in the\nsummer of 1899, a set of superposed surfaces for the quarter-size\nmodel were constructed during the winter of 1900–1901 The quarter-\nsize model, equipped with these surfaces, is shown in Plates 75 and\n76, where the model is seen mounted on its launching car, which is\nattached to the floats heretofore referred to It was originally planned\nnot to employ guy-posts when using the superposed surfaces, but after\nthe latter had been constructed and attached to the frame, it was\nfound that they would have to be made with rigid joints instead of\nhinged joints if the guy-posts were omitted As the hinged joints,\nhowever, were already made, and permitted the surfaces to be folded\nup so as to occupy a much smaller [p232] space in shipping them, it\nwas decided to retain the hinged form of construction and use the\nguy-posts as shown in the above plates PL 70 PLAN VIEW OF QUARTER-SIZE

elevation, side elevation and three-quarter\nelevation in Plates 71 and 72, respectively, was taken down the river\nin June, 1901, in order to make some tests with it from the small\nhouse-boat, which had been previously moved to the middle of the\nriver opposite Widewater, Va A test of it in free flight was made on\nJune 18, its condition at this time being shown by Data Sheet No 12\nin Appendix The launching apparatus worked perfectly and the\naerodrome started off on an absolutely even keel, dropping only a few\ninches immediately upon leaving the launching apparatus, and\ncontinuing straight ahead directly into the light wind of something\nless than 2 miles an hour After it had gone only about 100 feet,\nhowever, it began to descend slowly, but still maintained a perfectly\neven balance, and finally touched the water about 150 feet from the\nhouse-boat, having been in the air between 4 and 5 seconds It was\nimmediately recovered, and as soon as the wings could be dried out\nanother test was made, as it was thought probable that the wind had\ninterfered with the carburetor to such an extent that the engine had\nnot received the proper mixture of gas Upon this second test the\nlaunching apparatus again worked perfectly and the aerodrome again\nflew straight ahead on a perfectly even keel, and at a uniform height\nfrom the water until it had gone about 300 feet, when it again began\nto descend slowly and finally touched the water about 350 feet from\n\n\nthe house-boat, having been in the air about 10 seconds While the\ntests were very disappointing, owing to the extreme brevity of the\nflights, yet they showed conclusively that the balancing of the\naerodrome was correct, at least as far as motion in a straight line and\nin a quiet atmosphere was concerned As one and a half horse-power,\nwhich was felt to be the very minimum which would successfully\npropel the aerodrome, was furnished by the engine only when\nworking at its very best, and as the change in conditions from a quiet\nstate to a velocity of something like 40 feet per second evidently\ncaused a considerable drop in the power because of the change in the\ngaseous mixture which the carburetor furnished to the engine, it was\ndecided not to make any further test of the aerodrome until the\nengine cylinders could be reconstructed so as to provide more\neffective means for cooling it, and thereby a reasonable margin of\npower above that actually necessary The aerodrome was accordingly\nreturned to Washington for the purpose of making new cylinders for\nthe engine In constructing these new cylinders the old cylinder heads\nfrom the previous cylinders were used in order to expedite their\ncompletion This proved in the end to be a very great mistake, though\nat the time it seemed probable that the use of them would save much\ndelay and considerable expense The new cylinders were constructed\nof steel tubing originally one-half inch thick, which [p233] was\nmachined to the form clearly shown in the photograph, Plate 77,\nwhere it will be seen that thin radiating ribs spaced one-quarter inch\napart were formed integral with the cylinder, the combustion\nchambers or heads being screwed on and brazed to the cylinders After much delay the new cylinders were completed, and upon test it\nwas found that while the radiating ribs assisted very greatly in\nkeeping the engine cool, yet the valves were so small that the gas was\nnot able to get in and out of the cylinders rapidly enough to permit\nthe engine to furnish its full power Even at this stage it would have\nbeen better either to have made new cylinder heads with larger valves\nor to have made entirely new cylinders and cylinder heads, but in the\neffort to economize time and money it seemed best to try to overcome\npart of the defect by adding an auxiliary inlet valve This was\nconstructed, and upon test it was found that, although the engine\ndeveloped 3 2 horse-power on the Prony brake at 1800 R P M , and\n\n\neven maintained 5 1 horse-power on the brake for a few seconds\nwhen running at 3000 R P M",
    "M , the ports leading from the valve\nchamber to the cylinders were so small that they became heated after\nthe engine had run for 2 minutes and premature ignition occurred,\nwhich, of course, immediately and very greatly reduced the power\ndeveloped It was decided, however, in view of the tests in which the engine\nhad developed 3 2 horse-power at 1800 R P M M , that there was\nsufficient margin of power to enable it to propel the quarter-size\nmodel, even if it was not working at its best After concluding the\nProny-brake tests on the engine, it was mounted in its proper position\nin the aerodrome frame and connected to the propeller shafts Some\npendulum tests were then made, showing an average lift of\napproximately 57 per cent of the total flying weight But it was found\nthat the propeller and transmission shafts and their bearings would\nnot stand the strain due to the increased power of the engine Newer\nand stronger shafts and bearings were, therefore, constructed and\nfurther pendulum tests were made It was then found that the\ntransverse frame which supported the shafts and bearings was too\nweak, and this was strengthened by substituting newer and thicker\ntubing where it seemed necessary These changes and repairs were all completed by October, 1901,\nand the quarter-size model was at last, after months of delay, felt to\nbe in a condition which justified the expectation that its next flight\nwould be entirely successful In view of the much more important\nwork on the large aerodrome which demanded immediate attention\nthe quarter-size model in this completed condition was put aside Nothing more was done with it until April, 1903, when some shop\ntests were made preliminary to taking it to Quantico, where, on\nAugust 8, it made a successful flight, which is described in Chapter XII\n◊ ◊\n[p234]\nCHAPTER X\nCONSTRUCTION AND TESTS OF THE LARGE ENGINE\nThe main requirement in an engine for an aerodrome—aside from\nreliability and smoothness of operation, which are necessary in an\nengine for any kind of locomotion—is that it shall develop the\ngreatest amount of power for the least weight It is, therefore,\ndesirable to reduce the weight and number of parts of the engine to\nthe very minimum, so far as this can be done without sacrificing\nreliability and smoothness of running Furthermore, since the\nstrongest metal for its weight is steel, and since the greatest strength\nof steel is utilized when the stress acting on it is one of tension, it is\nadvisable to design the engine so that the parts which sustain the\ngreatest strains shall be of steel and, as far as possible, meet with\nstrains which are purely tensional ones In designing the new engine for the large aerodrome it was,\ntherefore, planned to make it entirely of steel, as far as this was\npossible The only parts which were not of steel were the bronze\nbushings for the bearings, the cast-iron pistons, and cast-iron liners of\nthe cylinders Previous experience had shown that, while it is possible\nto use a cast-iron piston in a steel cylinder or even a steel piston in a\nsteel cylinder, provided the lubrication be kept exactly adjusted, yet\nthe proper lubrication of the piston and cylinder of a gas engine is\ndifficult even under the most favorable conditions, owing to the fact\nthat excessive lubrication causes trouble from the surplus oil\ninterfering with the sparking apparatus It was, therefore, determined\nnot to risk serious trouble by attempting to have the pistons bear\ndirectly on the steel walls of the cylinders While visiting the French engine builders in the summer of 1900 in\nthe attempt to find one willing to undertake the construction of a\nsuitable engine for the aerodrome, it was pointed out to them that the\ngreat amount of weight which they claimed to be necessary for the\ncylinders, and which they stated made it impossible for them to build\nan engine which would meet the requirements as to power and\nweight, could be very greatly reduced by making the cylinders in the\n\n\nform of thin steel shells having cast-iron linings All, however, to\nwhom this suggestion was made declared that it was impossible to\nbuild satisfactory cylinders in this way; some of them even stated that\nthey had tried it and found it impossible to keep the thin liners tight\nin the steel shells The difficulty which they had encountered is due to\nthe difference in expansion of the steel and the iron when raised to a\nrather high temperature by the heat of the explosions, if the cylinders\nare not well jacketed with water; and if the steel [p235] shells are\nwater jacketed they then do not expand as much as the cast-iron\nliners, and this causes the latter to become “out of round” because of\nthe compression strains produced in them when trying to expand\nmore than the steel shells As past experience had shown, however,\nthat it was possible to keep the liners tight in small cylinders, it was\nbelieved that by taking proper care in the construction there would be\nno difficulty in this respect with the cylinders of this larger engine In carrying out these plans, however, of making the cylinders of\nsteel, numerous constructional difficulties were encountered which\ncould not be foreseen when the design was made Had they been\nforeseen, provision for obviating them could easily have been made As will be seen from the drawing, Plate 78, the engine cylinders\nconsisted primarily of a main outer shell of steel one-sixteenth of an\ninch thick, near the bottom end of which was screwed and brazed a\nsuitable flange, by which it was bolted to the supporting drum or\ncrank chamber These shells, which were seamless, with the heads\nformed integral, were designed to be of sufficient strength to\nwithstand the force of the explosion in them, and, in order to provide\na suitable wearing surface for the piston, a cast-iron liner one-\nsixteenth of an inch thick was carefully shrunk into them Entering\nthe side of the cylinder near the top, was the combustion chamber,\nmachined out of a solid steel forging, which also formed the port\nwhich entered the cylinder and was fastened to it by brazing The\nwater jackets, which were formed of sheet steel 020 inch thick, were\nalso fastened to the cylinder by brazing, and it was in connection with\nthe brazing of these water jackets that the first serious difficulty was\nmet in the construction of the engine In the first place, as the jackets\nwere of an irregular shape and of a different thickness of metal from\nthe walls of the cylinder to which they were joined, the expansion and\n\n\ncontraction due to the extreme heat necessary for properly brazing the\njoints caused such serious strains in various and unexpected directions\nthat it was only by exercising the very greatest care and patience that\na completely tight joint at all points of the jacket could be secured In\nthe second place, the size of the cylinders and the consequently large\nextent of water-jacket surface, complicated the problem The\nmaintenance over this large surface of the extreme heat necessary for\nbrazing involved discomfort and, indeed, actual suffering to the\nperson engaged in the work, and much care and skill were demanded\nin so distributing the heat that the temperature of the surface of the\njackets would be uniform enough to prevent serious strains from\nexpansion and contraction As no workman could be found either\ncompetent to do the work or willing to undergo the personal\ndiscomfort, the writer was obliged to do all this brazing work himself Besides the difficulties due to the expansion and contraction of the\njackets while they were being brazed, the greatest care had to be\nexercised to avoid heating the cylinders so hot as to weaken the [p236]\njoint where the explosion chambers were joined to the cylinders,\nwhich, of course, had been brazed before the jackets were fitted to\nthem preparatory to brazing them Another great difficulty was that the ring which encircled the\ncylinder near the middle of its length, and which formed the bottom\npart of the water jacket, expanded very much more than the cylinder\nitself, so that, if it was brazed to the cylinder before the jacket was\nbrazed to it, the heat of brazing the jacket to the ring would cause the\nring to break loose from the cylinder; while if the ring was not\npreviously brazed to the cylinder, but was brazed after the jacket had\nbeen brazed to it, the very much greater heat required for brazing the\nring to the cylinder caused the spelter to burn out of the joint between\nthe jacket and the ring Furthermore, it was found very difficult to\nbraze the two joints at the same time, since in brazing the ring to the\ncylinder it was best to have the cylinder in an inverted vertical\nposition, so that the spelter could be made to flow evenly around the\nring and form a fillet against the wall of the cylinder, while in brazing\nthe jackets to the ring it was best to have the cylinder in the reverse\nvertical position or lying on its side so that the spelter could properly\nflow into this joint Finally, however, after what proved to be most\n\n\nexasperating and tedious work, the five cylinders necessary for the\nengine were completed and a series of tests was immediately made During the course of these tests the water circulation became\nobstructed in several instances, and the consequent high temperature\nto which the cylinders and jackets were raised caused severe strains in\nthe jackets which, in turn, produced breaks in the brazed joints These\nbreaks had to be rebrazed, and in brazing them it was necessary in\nalmost every case to remove the cast-iron liners and rebraze the entire\njackets from start to finish, as the application of the intense heat\nnecessary for brazing at any one point produced such severe strains\nthat before the break which was being repaired could be completed\nother breaks developed at various points of the jacket It was,\ntherefore, necessary to get the whole jacket up to a fairly uniform\nheat and complete the brazing while it was in this condition, and then\nkeep the whole cylinder at a uniform but gradually decreasing\ntemperature until it had sufficiently cooled off On account of these troubles with the water jackets and the\ncylinders, it was decided to build some extra cylinders, not only\nbecause past experience had suggested improvements in detail in the\nconstruction of the jackets, which would prevent to a large extent the\ngreat troubles which had been met with in the brazed joints, but also\nto insure having sufficient cylinders to enable the engine to be always\nin working condition, even though several of the cylinders might be\nout of commission from slight imperfections in the jackets or at other\npoints While the construction of these new cylinders involved a\nrepetition of the arduous task of brazing, yet the minor improvements\nwhich were introduced [p237] proved eminently successful in\nproviding against future troubles from leaky jackets 5in Cylinder by\n5\n1\n2in\nStroke Engine

general form of construction of the engine with the improved\ncylinders will be readily understood from the drawings, Plates 78–81,\nin which Plate 78 is a detail sectional view, previously referred to,\nthrough one of the cylinders; Plate 79 is an end elevation of the port\nside, Plate 80 is a plan view, and Plate 81 is an elevation of the\nstarboard bed plate which supports that side of the engine, and by\nwhich it was fastened to the aerodrome frame, this view showing\nparticularly the sparking apparatus which was mounted on the bed\nplate The engine consists primarily of a single crank shaft provided\nwith a single crank pin, the shaft having bearings in a drum which\nconsists essentially of two heads Arranged around the crank shaft and\nattached at equidistant points of the drum are five cylinders Mounted\non the port side of the crank shaft and close to the crank arm is a\nsmall gear, which through suitable gears mounted on the port head of\nthe drum drives a double-pointed cam which has a bearing on the\nexterior of the hub of the drum The ratio of these gears is such that\nthe cam is driven at one-quarter the speed of the crank shaft, and in\nthe reverse direction Mounted on the exterior side of the port head of\nthe drum are five punch rods, the upper ends of which are within a\nsixty-fourth of an inch of being in contact with the exhaust-valve\nstems of the cylinders, and on the lower end of these rods are\nhardened-steel rollers which rest on the double-pointed cam—this one\ncam thus serving to operate the exhaust valves of all five of the\ncylinders The port head of the drum is connected to the port bed\nplate, by which it is supported, by means of a flanged bushing in\n\n\nwhich are formed tongues and grooves which fit into corresponding\ngrooves and tongues formed in the hub of the drum, it being\nnecessary to have a certain amount of space between this bed plate\nand the head of the drum to provide room for the exhaust-valve cam\nand its co-acting punch rods The starboard bed plate is fastened to\nthe starboard head of the drum by bolts which draw the web of the\nbed plate against the face of the drum The sparking gears are driven\nby means of a gear formed on a sleeve which telescopes over the hub\nof the starboard drum, and has a bearing thereon, the end of the\nsleeve terminating in a ring which is fastened to the crank shaft Since the five connecting rods must center on the one crank pin, the\nbronze shoes in which they terminate can occupy only a portion of the\ncircumference of the pin, and with the relative proportions which here\nexisted between the length of stroke of crank and the length of the\nconnecting rod, the circumferential width of the connecting-rod shoes\nwas slightly less than sixty degrees, thus leaving uncovered a crank\nspace of about one-sixth of the circumference, which it was necessary\nto have in order to provide room for the change in relative position of\nthe shoes due to the angularity of the connecting rods In [p238] the\nexperimental engine the connecting-rod shoes were all given their\nbearing directly on the crank pin, as heretofore described, being held\nin contact therewith by means of cone nuts, which were screw-\nthreaded to the crank pin, the taper of the cones permitting\nadjustment for wear This method of connecting these parts to the\ncrank pin is the usual plan of connecting three or more connecting\nrods to one crank pin So much trouble had been experienced with the\nwater jackets and with minor defects in the experimental engine that\nno long runs had been possible with it, and consequently no trouble\nhad been experienced because of the small amount of bearing area\nprovided by this method of joining the connecting rods to the crank\npin When, however, the new engine was completed it was found that\nafter working at high power for a few minutes the connecting-rod\nshoes heated so rapidly that it was impossible to run the engine for\nmore than ten or twelve minutes, the excessive heating of the shoes\ncausing a great diminution in power besides the danger of serious\ndamage if the tests were continued longer At first this defect seemed\nalmost fatal, as there appeared to be no way of providing sufficient\n\n\nbearing area for the five connecting rods on one crank pin Happily,\nhowever, the writer was able to overcome this defect by an improved\ndesign which enables all five connecting rods to operate on the one\ncrank pin, and at the same time provides each with the full amount of\nbearing area which it would have were it the only connecting rod\noperating on the crank pin This arrangement consists essentially of a\nmain connecting rod formed of a steel forging terminating in a sleeve\nwhich encircles the crank pin and is provided with a bronze lining for\ngiving a proper bearing surface between the connecting rod and the\ncrank pin, both the steel sleeve and the bronze lining being split, but\nat right angles to each other, to permit assembling them on the crank\npin This steel sleeve, the upper half of which is formed integral with\nthe main connecting rod is rounded off to a true circle on its exterior\ncircumference, except at the point where the rod joins it The other\nfour connecting rods terminating in bronze shoes are then caused to\nbear on the exterior of this sleeve, being held in contact therewith,\nand permitted to have a sliding motion thereon sufficient to take care\nof the variation in angularity of the connecting rods, by means of the\ncone nuts which are screw-threaded to the sleeve and locked thereto\nby means of the jam nuts, as shown in the drawings The main\nconnecting rod, of course, acts in the same way as in the ordinary case\nwhere each cylinder has its separate crank pin The other four\nconnecting rods deliver their effort to the crank pin through the sleeve\nin which the first connecting rod terminates, and they, therefore, do\nnot receive any of the rubbing effect due to the rotation of the crank\npin, except that of slipping a very short distance over the\ncircumference of the sleeve during each revolution, the amount of\nslipping depending on the angularity of the connecting rod This\nimproved type of bearing was successful from the time of its first trial,\nand even in later [p239] tests in which the engine was run for ten\nconsecutive hours at full power it showed no signs whatever of\noverheating As this new form of connecting-rod bearing for the crank\npin had never been tried before, the precaution was taken to leave the\nthreads on the crank pin for the cone nuts, so that if this new bearing\nshould not prove successful the old plan of having the connecting-rod\nshoes bear directly on the crank pin could be reverted to These\nthreads are clearly seen in Plate 78 and were never removed from the\n\n\ncrank pin, though their removal would have added considerably to\nthe area of the bearing surface of the main connecting rod, had more\nbearing surface seemed necessary The lubrication of the main crank-shaft bearing and of the crank pin\nwas effected by means of a small oil cup, fastened to the port bed\nplate, which fed oil through a hole in the hub of the drum to a\ncircular groove formed in the bronze bushing in the hub The crank\nshaft being hollow, a hole was drilled through it in line with the\ngroove in the bushing, and the oil was then led from the interior of\nthe crank shaft through a pipe connected to the plug in the end\nthereof, and through a hole drilled in the crank arm to the hollow\ncrank pin Small holes through the crank pin permitted oil to pass to\nthe exterior thereof and thus oil the bearing of the main connecting\nrod Small holes through the sleeve and bushing of the main\nconnecting rod fed oil under the shoes of the other four connecting\nrods, the small holes being placed in oil grooves formed in the interior\nof the bronze bushing The lubrication of the pistons was effected by\nmeans of small crescent-shaped oil cups fastened to the outer wall of\nthe cylinders, which distributed the oil equidistantly around the\ncircumference of the pistons, through small tubes which projected\nthrough corresponding holes drilled in the cylinder wall These oil\ncups for the cylinders were, while small, of sufficient size to furnish a\nsupply for approximately one hour, and were so positioned on each\ncylinder as to have a gravity feed It may be mentioned here that\nwhile there were many parts of the engine which were of\nunprecedented lightness there was nothing which excelled these oil\ncups in this respect, as they were made of sheet steel 003 of an inch\nthick, riveted and soldered up The crank-shaft bearing in the\nstarboard drum was oiled from an oil cup mounted on the outside of\nthe bed plate and connected by a pipe to a hole in the inner wall of\nthe drum, which was connected to the oil grooves in the bronze\nbushing in the hub of the drum The first set of pistons for this engine were similar in design to\nthose shown in the assembled drawings, except that they had side\nwalls and heads which were twice as thick as those shown These\nlighter pistons were constructed later, and were just as good as the\nearlier and heavier ones It will be noted that the pistons have two\n\n\ndeep but thin ribs reinforcing the head The pistons were slightly\ntapered from the middle, where they were 005 inch smaller than the\ncylinder bore, toward the outer end, where they were 0075 inch\nsmaller [p240] than the bore The outer piston ring was 0035 inch\nnarrower than its groove, the second one 003 inch, the third 0025\ninch, and the inner one 002 inch narrower than its groove The rings\nwere bored one-sixteenth inch off center with the exterior surface, and\nhad one-eighth inch diameter of spring They were of the lap-joint\ntype, with the sides of the laps carefully fitted and only one-sixty-\nfourth-inch clearance at the ends of the laps to allow for thermal\nexpansion As no grinding facilities were obtainable in Washington,\nthe cylinders were carefully bored smooth and free from taper, and\nthe pistons were worn in to a perfect fit by running them in by a belt\nfor twenty-four hours, with copious oil supply The main connecting rod was\n7\n8\n-inch\ndiameter and solid, while the other four were of the same diameter\nbut with a\n5\n8\n-inch\nhole in them The gudgeon pins in the pistons were hollow steel tubes\n7\n8\n-inch\ndiameter and case-hardened, and were oiled entirely by the oil thrown\noff by centrifugal force from the crank-pin bearing, the oil running\nalong the connecting rods and through suitable holes at the heads into\noil grooves in the bronze bushings in these heads Since on an engine for an aerodrome the best plan for releasing the\nexhaust gases from the engine is to get rid of them as soon as possible,\nso long as they are released behind the aviator and do not interfere\nwith his view in the direction of motion, it was decided to have the\ngases exhaust immediately from the combustion chambers; but in\norder to prevent their playing on and heating the main bearing of the\ncrank shaft in the port drum the combustion chambers were each\nprovided with a chamber below the exhaust-valve seat, with a side\n\n\noutlet therefrom The manifold pipe through which the gaseous\nmixture was supplied to the inlet valves of the engine consisted of a\ntube bent to a circle and having five branch tubes, each leading to one\nof the automatic inlet valves, which fitted removable cast-iron seats\nfastened by a nut in the upper part of each combustion chamber The\nvery small amount of clearance between the engine and the frame\nnecessitated that this pipe be cut in three places and joined by flanges\nin order to properly assemble it on the engine when the latter was\nmounted in the frame The carburetor, which was placed near the rear\nof the aviator’s car, was connected through suitable pipes to this\ncircular inlet pipe, at a point horizontally in line with the center of\nthe shaft The auxiliary air valve consisted of a sleeve rotatably\nmounted on the vertical pipe leading from the carburetor to the\nmanifold, holes in the sleeve being brought to coincide more or less\nwith holes in the vertical pipe, by the operator, when more or less air\nwas required or when he wished to vary the speed of the engine The\ncooling water for the jackets of the cylinders was led to them through\na circular manifold pipe on the starboard side connected by a vertical\npipe with the centrifugal pump situated at the lower point of the\nlower pyramid of the aerodrome frame The heated water was led\nfrom the jackets through another [p241] circular manifold pipe on the\nport side, through two connections to the radiating tubes at the front\nand rear, respectively, of the cross-frame These radiating tubes,\nwhich were provided with thin radiating ribs soldered to them, finally\nled the cooled water to the tank situated in the extreme rear of the\naviator’s car, a suitable pipe from the bottom of this tank being\nconnected to the inlet side of the centrifugal pump The centrifugal\npump was driven by means of a vertical shaft connected to the crank\nshaft through a set of bevel gears which drove it at three times the\nspeed of the engine The bearings through which these gears were\nconnected were mounted on the port bed plate, and in order to allow\nfor a certain amount of vibration between the engine and the pump\nthis vertical connecting shaft had a telescoping section connected\nthrough suitable splines The sparking apparatus comprised, first, a primary sparker similar\nto the simplest form of such devices which have since come into\ncommon use, where a cam driven by the engine co-acts with a pawl\n\n\non the end of a spring, but in this case, as this sparker was used for all\nfive cylinders, the cam was driven at a speed of two and one-half\ntimes that of the engine shaft, thus making and breaking the primary\ncircuit five times in each two revolutions of the engine Second, a\nspark coil, the primary terminals of which were connected to the\nprimary sparker and to a set of dry batteries Third, a secondary\ndistributor consisting of a disc carrying a contact brush and driven at\na speed one-half that of the engine, this brush being constantly\nconnected through a contact ring to one of the terminals of the high-\ntension side of the spark coil and running over the face of a five-\nsection commutator, each of the sections of which was connected to a\nspark plug, the other high-tension terminal of the spark coil being, of\ncourse, grounded on the engine frame This sparking apparatus was\nfirst constructed by using blocks of red fibre for insulation After the\nengine was completed and was being tested difficulties were met with\nin the sparking apparatus which at that time appeared inexplicable After a great deal of annoyance and loss of time it was finally\ndiscovered that the red fibre was not as good an insulating medium as\nit was supposed to be, owing to the zinc oxide used in making it In\ndamp weather the sparking apparatus absolutely refused to work, and\nit was found that the moisture in the air caused the zinc oxide in the\nfibre to nullify its insulating qualities This trouble, after being\nlocated, was cured by substituting hard rubber for the red fibre At the time when this engine was built, as well as earlier when the\nexperimental engine was built, it was impossible to procure any wire\nwhich had been properly insulated to withstand the high voltages\nnecessary for the connections between the high-tension side of the\nspark coil and the secondary distributor, and from the secondary\ndistributor to the spark plugs in the cylinders While at this time this\nappears a very simple matter, yet the trouble experienced and [p242]\nthe delays caused by the lack of such small accessories which are now\nso easily procurable were very exasperating, and it was finally\nnecessary to insulate these wires by covering them with several\nthicknesses of ordinary rubber tube of different diameters telescoped\nover each other In the early tests of this new engine, which were made with it\nmounted on a special testing frame and delivering its power to the\n\n\nwater-absorption dynamometers, the engine was operated without\nany fly wheels, and, so far as its smoothness of operation was\nconcerned and its ability to generate its maximum power, it did not\nrequire any After the completion of the tests on the testing frame the engine\nwas assembled in the aerodrome frame, which was first mounted on\nthe floor of the launching car The car itself was mounted on a short\ntrack in the shop, which arrangement provided a smoothly rolling\ncarriage which could be utilized for measuring the thrust of the\npropellers by merely attaching a spring balance between the rear of\nthe car and a proper holding strap on the track In the first tests of the\nengine under these conditions, it was found that while the engine\nitself did not require any fly wheels, yet the lack of them caused\ntrouble with the transmission and propeller shafts, which, while it had\nnever been anticipated, was easily understood when it was\nencountered This difficulty was caused by the “reverse torque,”\nwhich fluctuated from a maximum to a minimum five times during\neach double revolution of the engine, and which set up fluctuating\ntorsional strains of such magnitude in the transmission and propeller\nshafts that the shafts themselves became exceedingly hot after a few\nminutes operation of the engine, and under more prolonged periods of\noperation these fluctuating torsional strains caused a permanent\ntwisting and bending of the shafts The transmission and propeller\nshafts were at first made of tubing one-sixteenth of an inch thick, but\nthese were abandoned both on account of the necessity of abandoning\nthe screw-thread method of attaching the flange couplings and gears,\nand also because these shafts had been designed when it was expected\nto transmit only twelve horse-power to each propeller, while the\nincrease of power in the large engine necessarily required much\nstronger shafts The first shafts which were actually tested in the\nframe were, therefore, one and one-half inches in diameter by three-\nthirty-seconds of an inch thick, the tubing having been one-thirty-\nsecond of an inch larger originally and turned down to this size to\ninsure a straight shaft When these shafts twisted under the action of\nthe reverse torque of the engine, a very much heavier set, practically\ntwice as thick, were constructed When used in the tests these heavier\nshafts, while much stronger, still showed a large amount of heating\n\n\ndue to the fluctuating torsional strains Upon calculation it was found that by providing specially light fly\nwheels the major portion of this reverse torque could be eliminated\nfor a less increase [p243] in weight than would be occasioned by\nsufficiently increasing the thickness of the transmission and propeller\nshafts to safely stand it Since it was desired to concentrate as much as\npossible of the weight of the fly wheels in the rims, the idea at once\nsuggested itself of building them up like a bicycle wheel by means of\ntangent spokes Two steel automobile-wheel rims were therefore\nprocured thirty-three inches in diameter, and these were provided\nwith tangent spokes connected to special steel hubs fitted to the crank\nshaft of the engine The rims themselves not being quite heavy\nenough, and constructional reasons necessitating their being at\ndifferent distances from the center of length of the crank pin, the\nextra weight which it was desired to give to these rims was provided\nby means of steel wire wound tightly around and fastened to the rims,\nthe weight of each rim being made inversely proportional to its\ndistance from the center of the crank pin The first spokes which were\nused for these wheels were standard bicycle spokes three-thirty-\nseconds of an inch in diameter, but these were soon found to be\nentirely too weak to withstand the sudden strains due to the rapid\nstarting of the engine They were therefore replaced by standard\nspokes one-eighth of an inch in diameter, but these also proved too\nweak and were later replaced with special spokes made in the shop\nout of No 10 coppered-steel wire, which by test was found to have a\ntensional strength of 2192 pounds As these steel rims were only one-\nsixteenth of an inch thick and had not been made exactly true, but\nhad been straightened before being used, it was found that they very\nquickly went out of shape under the strain due to the centrifugal force\nat high speeds, and also when the engine was suddenly accelerated As long as they did stay true, however, it was found that they were\nsufficiently heavy to provide all of the fly-wheel effect it was\nnecessary to have in order to eliminate all trouble from the reverse\ntorque After further consideration, it was decided that the only means of\nconstructing a fly wheel which would have a stiff rim and at the same\ntime would not be heavier than the steel ones, which had been found\n\n\nadequate, was by perpetrating what would at first sight appear to be\nan absurdity A new set of rims for the fly wheels was made by\nconstructing them of an aluminum casting, the section of the rim\nbeing U-shaped After machining these rims and assembling the fly\nwheels with them, it was found that they were many times stiffer than\nthe previous steel ones of the same weight, and after this change no\nfurther trouble was experienced in keeping the fly wheels perfectly\ntrue, even under the most severe strains In fact, on one occasion\nwhen the engine broke loose from the propellers, it ran to a speed,\nwhich, while not exactly known, yet reached the limit of the\ntachometer, which was 2000 R P M , without injury to the fly\nwheels It will be recalled that in starting up the engine on the quarter-size\nmodel, the initial “cranking” necessary with a gasoline engine was\naccomplished by [p244] having two of the mechanics turn the\npropellers While this same plan might have been followed in the case\nof the large aerodrome, yet it would have involved some danger to the\nmechanics and would also have left the aviator without any means of\nrestarting the engine should it for any reason stop while in the air Believing it to be very important to provide means for enabling the\naviator to restart the engine in case it stopped in the air, the writer\ndevised the starting mechanism shown in the drawings, Plates 78 to\n80 Fastened by tongues and grooves to the port side of the engine\ncrank shaft, just outside of the bed plate, is a worm wheel, on the hub\nof which is mounted the bevel gear which drives the water-circulation\npump through the bevel pinion, as already described Mounted on the\nweb of the bed plate are two brackets, in which the shaft for the\nstarting crank is journaled, this shaft passing forward and downward\nthrough the front of the cross-frame of the aerodrome, where it is\njournaled in a bracket secured to the brace tubes thereof At the front\nor lower end of the shaft a crank handle is connected thereto by a\nratchet mechanism The upper end of the starting shaft, between the\nbearings of the two supporting brackets, is tongued and grooved, and\nslidably mounted thereon with co-acting grooves and tongues is a\nworm screw which, in the position shown in Plates 79 and 80, is in\ngear with the worm wheel just described However, when the worm\nscrew is slid along on the shaft until it is against the upper bracket it\n\n\nis out of gear with the worm wheel Mounted in the interior of the\ntubular starting shaft is a spring-pressed pawl plug, not shown, but\nwhich projects through one of the tongues on the shaft near the upper\nbracket If the worm screw is slid up against this upper bracket, this\npawl catches in a radial hole in the worm screw and holds it in this\nposition out of gear with the worm wheel Connected to this pawl\nplug and passing longitudinally through the center of the shaft is a\nwire which terminates in a button just at the end thereof By pulling\non this button the operator may release the worm and thus permit it\nto slide downward so that when the starting crank is turned in a\nclockwise direction the worm will screw itself into gear with the\nworm wheel, and any further turning of the starting crank will cause\nthe worm to force the worm wheel, and, consequently, the engine\nshaft, around in a clockwise direction As soon as the engine gets an\nexplosion the worm wheel slides the worm along against the upper\nbracket, where the spring pawl catches and holds it till it is again\nreleased by the operator as before This starting mechanism was a success from the first, and the\nengine was never started up in any other way With an aerodrome\nhaving the qualities of automatic equilibrium, which the Langley\nmachines have, it was felt very certain that by this mechanism the\nengine could be easily restarted while in the air, in case it was\ninadvertently stopped [p245]\nThe reason for building the engine with five cylinders instead of\nsome other number, and for arranging them radially on a central\ndrum using only one crank pin may not appear quite obvious The\nadvantages gained by such a construction, however, are very great,\nand may be briefly summed up as follows:\nFirst, since in a gas engine of the four-cycle type there is only one\nexplosion in each cylinder every two revolutions, and the crank shaft\nand crank pin therefore are loaded only one-quarter of the time for\neach cylinder, it is obvious that by having four cylinders arranged\nradially around a central drum the load on the bearings of a single\ncrank shaft and crank pin may be kept very uniform However, with\nfour cylinders thus arranged it is impossible to have the cylinders\nexplode and exert their effort on the crank at uniform intervals in the\ncycle, it being necessary to have the cylinders explode in the order of\n\n\n1, 3, 4, 2, 1, etc , thus giving intervals between explosions of 180\ndegrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, etc , or to have them\nexplode in the order of 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, etc , thus giving intervals of 180\ndegrees, 270 degrees, 180 degrees, 90 degrees, etc On the other hand,\nwith any odd number of cylinders the explosions will occur at equal\nintervals in the cycle With three cylinders they will explode in the\norder of 1, 3, 2, 1, etc , or at equal intervals of 240 degrees, while\nwith five cylinders they will explode in the order of 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1,\netc , or at equal intervals of 144 degrees It is therefore seen that there\nis a great advantage in smoothness of operation and uniformity of\ntorque of the engine through having an odd number of cylinders\ninstead of an even number Second, it is readily apparent that the greater the number of\ncylinders, provided the number is an odd one, the more uniform the\ntorque will be, and it would seem at first that seven cylinders would\ntherefore be better than five, since the uniform intervals between\nexplosions with seven cylinders would be only 103 degrees\n(approximately) The advantage gained, however, through seven\ncylinders instead of five is largely, if not completely, counterbalanced\nby the added number of parts and the difficulty of providing sufficient\ncircumferencial width for the connecting-rod shoes on the crank-pin\nbearing, even with the improved construction of this bearing already\ndescribed There is considerable fluctuation of the torque in each\nrevolution of the engine with five cylinders, but this fluctuation of\ntorque is more easily smoothed out by the use of very light fly wheels\nthan by increasing the number of cylinders, and thus adding to the\ncomplication of the engine Third, the strongest point in favor of the radially arranged cylinders\nis the reduction in weight and complication which it permits The\ncrank shaft is reduced to the very minimum, there being only one\ncrank pin with two main bearings which can, without any difficulty\nwhatever, be kept absolutely in line with each other and thus prevent\nbinding and loss of power Again, the use of a single-throw crank not\nonly reduces the cost and weight of the crank [p246] itself, but makes\nit very much less liable to damage; long crank shafts with several\ncrank pins being frequently twisted by improper explosions in the\ncylinders The supporting drum or crank chamber is likewise reduced\n\n\nto the very minimum, both in weight and simplicity, the drums being\nperfectly symmetrical with no lost space either inside of them or on\ntheir exteriors The cam mechanism for operating the valves is\nreduced to a simple ring carrying (for a five-cylinder engine) a\ndouble-pointed cam and journaled on the exterior of the hub of one of\nthe drums, the cam being driven by a train of gears journaled on studs\nmounted on the drum, and co-acting with a gear fastened to the crank\nshaft against the crank arm The radial arrangement of the cylinders is thus seen to give not only\nan engine with the smallest number of parts, each of which is as far as\npossible worked to a uniform amount during each complete\nrevolution of the crank shaft, but it also gives a very compact and\nreadily accessible mechanism with its center of gravity coincident\nwith its center of figure, and with the liability of damage to it, in case\nof a smash of the vehicle on which it is used, reduced to the minimum\nfrom the fact that the greatest weight is located at the strongest part Fourth, and of almost as great importance as the reduction in\nweight which the five-cylinder radial arrangement permits, is its\nunusual qualities as regards vibration Since these five-cylinder\nengines were built by the writer a very thorough treatment of their\nproperties as regards balancing has been given in a treatise on the\nbalancing of engines,44 so no discussion of the mathematical formulæ\ninvolved in a study of the question of the inherent balancing\nproperties of these engines will be here given It is sufficient to call\nattention to the fact that in an engine having five cylinders arranged\nradially, all of the reciprocating parts are balanced for all forces of the\nfirst, second and third orders As it is only the reciprocating parts\nwhich give any trouble in balancing any engine, the unbalanced\nrotating parts being readily balanced by placing an equal weight at an\nequal distance from the center of rotation, and on the opposite side\nthereof, it is readily seen that the properties of balancing which are\ninherent in this type of engine are unusual A six-cylinder engine\nhaving a six-throw crank shaft is not nearly so thoroughly balanced as\nthis type having its five cylinders radially arranged, for in the latter\ncase all the moving parts are in one plane, while in the former case\nthe moving parts are in six separate and parallel planes, and there is\nconsequently considerable longitudinal vibration which can never be\n\n\novercome While this is true as regards the vibration due to moving\nmasses, it is still more impressively true as regards vibration due to\nreaction arising from the force of the explosions in the engine\ncylinders, especially when the engine is running slowly and having\nheavy explosions The usual practice in balancing the rotating parts of an engine is to\nattach [p247] balance weights to the crank arms which are prolonged\nbeyond the center of the crank shaft and on the opposite side from the\ncrank pin; the radius of rotation of these balance weights being made\napproximately equal to the radius of the crank pin But aside from the\nconstructional difficulties which would be introduced, it was seen that\nif this plan was followed in this engine it would require a very large\nadditional weight Since the amount of this weight could be\ndiminished in exact proportion to the increase of the radius of\nrotation of the balance weights, it was at first decided to attach the\nweights to the rims of the fly wheels, the relative amount of weight\nattached to each wheel being inversely proportional to its actual\nlongitudinal distance from the crank-pin center It was very soon\nfound that the attachment of these balance weights to the fly wheel\ncaused excessive strains on the rims of the wheels, thereby causing\nthem to go out of line In order, therefore, to keep the amount of\nbalance weight small by carrying it at a considerable distance from\nthe center of the shaft, the weights were finally arranged as clearly\nshown in the drawings, Plates 78 to 80 There it is seen that the main\nportion of each of the balance weights consists of a flat arm bolted\nbetween the flanges which couple the transmission shafts to the\nengine shafts The flat arm terminates in a lozenge-shaped lug,\nadditional weight being provided by a plate fastened to one end of a\ntube, the other end of which terminates in a collar fastened around\nthe transmission shaft The tube is inclined at an angle of about thirty\ndegrees with the flat balance arm, thus acting as a brace to prevent\nthe balance arm from wobbling, the plate on the bracing tube being\nfastened to the lozenge-shaped lug by means of small bolts The tabulated statement of the weight of this large engine is given\nbelow From this it will be readily seen that the net weight of the\nengine proper is 124 17 pounds The fly wheels were in no way\nnecessary to the engine itself, but were used solely for the purpose of\n\n\nsmoothing out the torque of the engine so that the transmission shafts\nand propeller shafts might be kept down to the very minimum in\nweight Including the two fly wheels, the weight is 140 pounds Including the 20 pounds of cooling water the total weight of the\npower plant

    "64 pounds The construction of this large engine was completed in December,\n1901, and the first tests of it were made in January, 1902 As already\nstated, these first tests were made with the engine mounted on a\nspecial testing frame and delivering its power to two water-absorption\ndynamometers, no fly wheels being used, as none were required Later, when it became necessary either to use fly wheels or to greatly\nincrease the weight of the transmission and propeller shafts, in order\nto overcome the reverse torque, the two light fly wheels were added,\nand another series of tests was made of the engine on its testing\nframe The arrangement of the engine, dynamometers, and accessory\n[p248] apparatus is clearly shown in Plates 82, 83 and 84 The engine\nran in a clockwise direction, as viewed in Plate 82 AA are the fly\nwheels; BB the balance weights; CC the dynamometer shafts, on\nwhich are fastened the rotor plates which revolve inside of the\ndynamometer drums, DD, between stator plates fastened therein The\ndrums have a hub on either side, by which they are supported, these\nhubs being journaled on ball-bearings in the pedestals resting on the\nwooden framework The rotor plates do not touch the stator plates in\nthe dynamometers, but drag on the water with which the drums are\npartially filled, and thus tend to cause the drums to revolve around\nwith them The torque on each drum is measured by means of a rope,\nnot shown, fastened into the hook at the top of the drum, the rope\nbeing given a partial coil around the drum and passing off tangent\nthereto at the horizontal diameter is fastened to a pair of spring scales\nhung from the ceiling vertically above the point of tangency The\nscales and ropes were unfortunately not in position when these\nphotographs were taken, but the arrangement of them should be\nreadily understood",
    "The\nscales and ropes were unfortunately not in position when these\nphotographs were taken, but the arrangement of them should be\nreadily understood As the friction of the rotor plates on the water\nheats it in exact proportion to the amount of power absorbed, the\nsmall amount of water in the drums would be soon converted into\nsteam unless continually renewed or cooled When the rotor plates are\n\n\nrevolving the centrifugal force keeps the water pressed toward the\ncircumference of the drum, and the friction at any speed is dependent\non the area of the rotor plates in contact with the water The horse-\npower required to revolve the plates at any definite speed can\ntherefore be controlled by having an outlet for the water at the proper\nradial distance from the shaft The water from the water mains is led\nthrough the upper vertical pipe and allowed to flow into the funnel,\nand thence into the drum near the center where the centrifugal force\nthrows it to the circumference of the drum The lower vertical pipe is\nconnected to the drum at a suitable radial distance from the center,\nand the heated water thus passes through this pipe and into the lower\nfunnel connected to the sewer By the use of the funnels the drums are\nallowed to rock sufficiently to exert their pull on the spring scales\nwithout being affected by the supply and exhaust of water By the use of the funnels the drums are\nallowed to rock sufficiently to exert their pull on the spring scales\nwithout being affected by the supply and exhaust of water PL 82 DYNAMOMETER TESTS OF LARGE ENGINE ◊\nPL 83 DYNAMOMETER TESTS OF LARGE ENGINE ◊\nPL 84 DYNAMOMETER TESTS OF LARGE ENGINE ◊\nThe water for cooling the cylinders is led from the bottom of the\ntank E to the circulating pump F, supported in a discarded lower\npyramid of the aerodrome frame, the pump being driven by the small\nvertical shaft, as already described The water, after passing through\nthe pump and the engine cylinders, is led back to the upper part of the\ntank By suitable connections to the water mains and sewer, the water\nin the tank is kept at any desired temperature The gasoline supply\ntank is seen on the left-hand side of the testing frame, as viewed in\nPlate 82, the carburetor being placed below it and the gas supply pipe\nfrom the carburetor passing through the gasoline tank Instead of\njacketing the carburetor, a grid formed of thin copper tubes is\nsupported just above the multitude of small air pipes leading into the\ncarburetor, and some of [p249] the hot water from the engine is by-\npassed through this grid and thus warms the air as it passes into the\ncarburetor The small pipe that by-passes this water through the grid\nis seen connected to the outlet water pipe just above the cylinders, a\nsmall butterfly valve in the outlet pipe enabling the amount of heated\nwater passing through the grid to be controlled The return from the\ngrid is by means of the small pipe leading to the top of the large water\ntank The tachometer, which gives instantaneous readings of the\nspeed of the engine, is seen at G, where it is at all times in full view of\nthe operator These dynamometers proved to be excellently suited for the testing\nwork, and far ahead of anything else the writer has ever found for\nengine testing Since the power required to rotate the rotor plates,\nwith a uniform amount of water in the drums, varies as the cube of\nthe speed, it is readily seen that it is impossible for the engine to race\nor injure itself by running away, as frequently happens where there is\nno engine governor and Prony brakes are used to measure the power In the early tests the engine was never allowed to develop more\n\n\nthan 40 horse-power, as it was feared that by letting it develop more,\nwhich it was clearly seen to be capable of, it might be injured and\ncause a delay in the tests of the aerodrome In the second series of\ntests it was allowed to develop 51 horse-power at 935 R P M",

    "M , yet from the deflection\nproduced on the tachometer needle must have been considerably\nhigher than this Although the fly wheels, which were 33 inches in\ndiameter, with the aluminum rims and wire spokes, had been\nexceedingly well made, yet it was not considered safe to run them at\nthis speed, and the engine was immediately shut down At the\nmoment, however, that the engine had broken loose from its\npropellers and also momentarily jumped to this exceedingly high\nspeed there was absolutely no vibration that could be noticed, the\n\n\nunloaded engine running as smoothly as an electric motor This\nshowed very clearly that the running balance of the engine was as\nnear perfect as it would be possible to get it, except with a seven-\ncylinder engine, which is theoretically capable of more perfect\nbalance It was evident that what small vibration there was in the\nframe while the engine was developing its power was due almost\nentirely to the reverse torque, and, of course, could never be entirely\neliminated In the tests of the engine working in the frame, both while mounted\non the car and also when suspended from the springs, a great amount\nof delay was caused from the fact that the ball-bearings on the\ntransmission and propeller shafts frequently went to pieces There\nwere two reasons for this: In the first place, although carefully\nselected balls were used, defective ones were continually encountered Even a slight defect in a single ball resulted in its breaking under the\nrather severe test to which they were subjected, and, as is well known,\nthe breaking of one ball in a ball-bearing usually results in the\ndestruction of the whole bearing, especially if the races are light The\nsecond cause was that [p253] the whole aerodrome had been originally\ndesigned with the expectation of using a maximum of 24 horse-power,\nand as no margin had been left to provide for possible increases in the\nsize of the bearings, there was no room to permit them to be increased\nwithout almost completely reconstructing portions of the transverse\nframe While in the end it would have been cheaper to have\nreconstructed these portions in order to put in larger bearings, yet, as\nis always the case in experimental work of this kind, small changes\nwhich seem to hold out hope of overcoming difficulties are usually\nfollowed, rather than reconstructions which can be seen to involve\nconsiderable expense and delay After a number of minor changes had\nbeen made in the bearings, they were finally able to stand up fairly\nwell under the severe strain to which they were subjected when the\nengine developed its full power, and no further changes were made in\nthem; a defective race being, however, replaced by a new one as\noccasion demanded These tests demonstrated very clearly that at speeds of\napproximately 1000 revolutions per minute ball-bearings which are\nsubjected to considerable loads should be calculated with a\n\n\nconsiderable margin of safety, as the yielding of the frame, which\nmust necessarily be far from rigid, causes more or less error in the\nalignment of the shafts and bearings, and this introduces considerably\nincreased strains on the bearings In the early tests before the bearings\nwere strengthened, the balls in some of the races were on a few\noccasions ground to a very fine powder before it was discovered that\nthey had failed Such a result, it will be understood, could and did\noccur in the course of a very minute length of time In imitating as nearly as possible the conditions to which the\ncarburetor of the engine would be subjected during the period of\nlaunching, numerous tests were made in which the engine was\nbrought to its maximum speed and, without changing the adjustment\nof the mixture-controlling devices of the carburetor, sudden blasts of\nair were turned on it from various directions, and these were\ncontinued until the mixture-control devices were perfected to such a\npoint that gusts of thirty miles an hour suddenly directed from any\npoint against any portion of the apparatus would in no way effect the\nspeed and power of the engine These tests were considered necessary\nin view of the very sudden changes in conditions to which the\naerodrome would be subjected during its brief run down the\nlaunching track, the conditions changing in approximately three\nseconds from absolute quiescence of the aerodrome to a plunge\nthrough space at thirty-five feet per second An aviator would be more\nthan occupied with maintaining control of himself and of the\naerodrome, which at the moment of leaving the track might require\nconsiderable change in the adjustment of the Pénaud tail, and he\nwould, therefore, not be able to make any adjustments of the engine-\ncontrol devices This supposition was entirely confirmed in the actual\ntests of the aerodrome which are to be later described, the rush down\nthe track being [p254] so very brief that the engine could not have\nbeen given any attention by the aviator had it needed it, which\nfortunately it did not It is hardly necessary to recount at any length the great difficulties\nwhich was experienced in these tests of the engine in the aerodrome\nframe before the shafts, bearings, propellers, and, in fact, the frame\nitself were all properly co-ordinated so that confidence could be felt\nthat all of the parts would stand the strains which were likely to come\n\n\non them when the aerodrome was in flight These tests were really not\ntests of the engine itself, but of the frame, shafts, and bearings Suffice\nit to say that nearly a year was consumed by the various breakages of\nthe shafts, bearings, and propellers before it was felt that all of these\nparts could be depended on, and even then the weakness of the\nbearings above referred to was fully recognized Had some of the\nbetter-grade balls and steels for the bearings, which have since that\ntime come on the market, been obtainable then, there would have\nbeen no difficulty with these bearings However, this same remark\nmight be made with reference to nearly all of the details of the\naerodrome, for it was the accessories, such as bearings for the\ntransmission and propeller shafts, spark plugs, coils, batteries, and a\nsuitable carburetor for the engine, that caused the chief delay after\nthe main difficulty of getting a suitable engine had been overcome ◊\n[p255]\nCHAPTER XII\nFIELD-TRIALS IN 1903\nThe extended series of shop tests which had occupied a\nconsiderable portion of the late winter and early spring of 1903 had\ndemonstrated the following facts: First, with the aerodrome mounted\non the launching car, a propeller thrust of from 450 to 475 pounds\ncould be maintained indefinitely by the engine, and even when the\nengine was delivering its full power to the propellers, the vibration\nwas so small as to cause no apprehension that the wings and rudder\nwould be made to vibrate sufficiently to produce undue strains in\nthem Second, with the aerodrome suspended from the ceiling by\nsprings at the points at which the wings would be attached, the\nvibration produced by the engine developing it’s full power was even\nless than when the machine was mounted on the launching car and\nthere was, consequently, even less cause for concern that the wings\nand rudder might be set in vibration when the machine was free in\nthe air Third, the engine could be depended upon to deliver\nsomething over 52 horse-power when the five cylinders were working\nproperly, and even with one cylinder not working, but acting as a\ndead load against the others, approximately 35 horse-power could be\ndeveloped, while with two cylinders not working at all, the three\nwhich were working would deliver about 25 horse-power Therefore,\neven assuming that two of the five cylinders might become deranged\nduring a flight, there should still be sufficient power to propel the\nmachine These tests, some of which had been witnessed by members\nof the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, clearly demonstrated that\nthe time had arrived when it was safe to give the aerodrome a test in\nfree flight The machine itself together with all its appurtenances and\nmuch extra material for repairs in case of breakages, which previous\nexperience had shown to be almost certain, was accordingly taken\nfrom the shop and placed on the house-boat preparatory to taking it\ndown the river to the point opposite Widewater, Va , which had\nalready been selected as the “experimental ground ”\nOwing to the limited size of the shops it had been impossible to\n\n\nplace the wings and rudder in their proper positions on the aerodrome\nand determine its balancing in a way similar to that practiced with\nthe models The approximate settings for the wings and rudder had,\nhowever, been determined by calculation from the data obtained in\nthe test of the quarter-size model, so that it remained only to place the\nwings and a weight to represent the rudder actually on the machine in\nthe large space of the house-boat (which, however, was not large\nenough to permit the rudder to be assembled along with the wings),\nand thus check the balancing previously determined by calculation There were very [p256] few appurtenances which could be shifted in\nbalancing the aerodrome, but the proper disposition of weight had\nbeen so accurately determined by calculation that the floats, which, as\nwill be seen from the various photographs, were merely cylindrical\ntanks with pointed ends, and of a sufficient capacity to cause a\ndisplacement great enough to float the aerodrome when it came down\ninto the water, proved sufficient ballast for shifting the center of\ngravity to its proper point The flying weight of the aerodrome was\n830 pounds,47 including the weight of the writer, which was 125\npounds The total area of the wings or supporting surfaces was 1040\nsquare feet, or the ratio of supporting surface to weight was 1 25\nsquare feet per pound, which is the same as 8 pound per square foot After the balancing of the large aerodrome had been completed on\nthe house-boat, and everything else got in readiness as far as could be\ndone before actually arriving at the point at which the test was to be\nmade, the house-boat was towed down the river on July 14, 1903,\nand fastened to its mooring buoy, which had been placed in the\nmiddle of the river at a point practically opposite Widewater, Va , and\napproximately forty miles from Washington See Coast-Survey Chart,\nPlate 85 Sleeping quarters for the force of eight workmen and the regular\nsoldier from the United States Army, who had been detailed as a\nspecial guard, had been provided on the boat, but owing to the lack of\nspace it had been found impracticable to arrange proper cooking\nfacilities on the boat, and it had been found necessary to arrange to\ntransport the workmen to Chopawamsic Island, near Quantico, Va ,\nfor their meals It had been planned to use the twenty-five-foot power\nlaunch for this purpose, but owing to the heavy storms which became\n\n\nquite frequent soon after the house-boat was taken down the river, it\nwas found that the small launch was not sufficient, and it was\nnecessary to employ a tug-boat and keep it stationed there at all\ntimes This added very considerably to the expense of the\nexperiments, as the hire of this one tug-boat very nearly equalled the\npay-roll of the workmen, and while it was not expected that the stay\ndown the river would be so greatly prolonged as afterwards proved\nthe case it was felt certain that minor delays were sure to occur and\nthe experiments would at the very least require several weeks",

    "SE Referring to Plate 86, which shows the quarter-size model mounted\non its launching car on top of the large house-boat, and which was\ntaken only a few [p258] minutes before the model was actually\nlaunched, it will be noted that a board (A) projects from the front of\nthe launching car This board, which is mounted in a false floor of the\nlaunching car, is so arranged that when it strikes the two blocks (B) at\n\n\nthe end of the track it is driven backward in the car against the\ntriggers which prevent the uprights (D), supporting the aerodrome,\nfrom being folded down against the floor When this board strikes the\ntriggers it releases them and the springs (C), which in this case were\nrubber bands, immediately fold the vertical posts or uprights (D)\nagainst the brace posts (E), which are immediately folded down flat\nagainst the floor of the car through the action of the spring hinges, by\nwhich they are connected to it These uprights (D), which support the\naerodrome at the front and rear, respectively, are not released until a\nfraction of a second after the release of the clutch hook (F), which is\nattached to the middle upright (G), and which, grasping the lower\npyramid, holds the machine down firmly against the uprights (D)\npreviously referred to In order to prevent the possibility of the\naerodrome being released prematurely while the car is held at the\nextreme rear end of the track by the hook (H), a steel pin (J), which\ncan just be seen in the photograph, is pushed through a hole in the\nboard (A), and into a hole in a cross-member on the bottom of the car,\nthus holding the board in its proper position After the engine is\nstarted up one of the mechanics who has assisted in starting it is\nunder orders to remove the pin at the word “Ready,” and at the word\n“Go” the other mechanic who has assisted in starting the engine is\nunder orders to release the hook (H), and thus allow the car to dash\ndown the track In the experiment on August 8 the mechanic failed to\nremove the pin (J) at the proper time, and it was only after the\nmachine had been released and started down the track that it was\nseen that the pin had not been removed It was then, however, too\nlate to stop it, so the car dashed down the track Although the striking\nof the board against the blocks caused the pin to split the board to\npieces, the launching apparatus worked perfectly and the aerodrome\nstarted off on a perfectly even keel, the propellers revolving at an\nexceedingly high rate of speed The aerodrome flew straight ahead for\na distance of 350 feet, when it began to circle towards the right,\ndescending slightly as it circled Upon completing a quarter circle it\nagain began to rise, flying straight ahead until it had gone a similar\ndistance, when it again lost headway, but before it reached the water\nthe engine increased its speed and the aerodrome again rose When\nthe engine slowed down for the third time, however, the aerodrome\n\n\nwas not many feet above the river, so that before the engine regained\nits normal speed the aerodrome touched the water with its propellers\nstill revolving, but very slowly While the total distance covered was\nonly about 1000 feet, and the time that it was actually in the air 27\nseconds, yet in this brief time it had served the main purpose for\nwhich it had been built, which was to find out if the balancing of\n[p259] the large aerodrome, which had been determined by calculation\nfrom the results obtained with the steam-driven models, was correct For it was assumed that if the quarter-size model, which was an exact\ncounterpart of the large machine, should fly successfully with the\nsame balancing as that calculated for the large one, the large one\ncould reasonably be expected to act similarly It was at first thought\nbest to make another test with the model immediately after\nrecovering it from the water, but by the time it could be brought into\nthe house-boat and the water which had got into the engine cylinders\ncould be removed and the engine made to work properly quite a\nstrong wind had sprung up and rendered further tests of the model on\nthis day impossible If the launching track for the small machine could\nhave remained on the top of the boat without interfering with the\ncompletion of the preparations for testing the large machine, it would\nhave been left there and other tests made with the model when the\nweather was suitable, but as this could not be done without\ninterfering with the work on the large machine, and the delays with\nthe model had already been so great, the small track was immediately\nremoved and the model stored away in the house-boat for possible\nlater tests At the first it was impossible to account for the engine on the model\nrunning so irregularly and slowing down so soon after it was\nlaunched, as it was felt very certain that the cylinders could not in so\nshort a time, and with the aerodrome actually moving through the air,\nhave heated up sufficiently to cause it After a while, however, one of\nthe workmen volunteered the information that in his zeal to fill the\nfuel tank completely so as to insure a long flight, he had caused the\ntank to overflow so that some of the gasoline had run into the intake\npipe, and that he had noticed gasoline dripping from the intake pipe\nas the machine went down the track This excess gasoline in the\nintake pipe had caused the mixing valve which controls the quality of\n\n\nthe explosive mixture to be improperly set, so that it would not\nfurnish the proper mixture when the fuel was supplied in the proper\nway by the carburetor, and consequently when this excess gasoline\nhad evaporated, the mixture furnished to the engine was not proper,\nand it consequently slowed down, there being no human intelligence\non board to correct the adjustment of the mixing valve A series of seven photographs of this flight of the quarter-size model\nis given in Plates 87 to 93 Plate 87, taken with a kodak from the tug-\nboat stationed several hundred yards directly ahead of the house-boat,\nshows the machine in full flight heading directly for the tug-boat Although the aerodrome was about fifteen or twenty feet higher\nabove the level of the water than the camera, still, at the considerable\ndistance from which the photograph was taken, this view would not\nshow so much of the under side unless the machine had been pointing\nupward The photograph also proves very clearly that at the time it\nwas taken the machine had certainly not dropped at all below the\nlevel [p260] at which was launched In Plate 88 the camera was\nunfortunately not well aimed, and only the front guy-post, bearing\npoints, float and bowsprit are visible, besides the blur of the\npropellers, which, it will be noted, were moving very rapidly The\ncamera with which this and the succeeding plates were taken was one\nof the two special telephoto cameras belonging to the Zoological Park,\nbut built in the course of the aerodromic work and used where\nespecially rapid shutters were needed As the shutters on these\ncameras give an exposure of only\n1\n500\nof a second, and consequently are sufficiently rapid to show the\nindividual feathers in a rapidly moving bird’s wing, any distortion of\nthe machine in flight would certainly have been shown, but, as will be\nseen from the later photographs, no distortion of any kind occurred,\nboth the surfaces and the framework remaining in a perfectly straight\ncondition Near the bottom of Plate 88 is the tug from which Plate 87\nwas taken, and a careful inspection of Plate 87 shows two persons\nstanding on the roof of the house-boat, below the upper works, the\ngentleman on the left being Mr Thomas W Smillie, the official\nphotographer of the Smithsonian Institution, who took all of the\nphotographs except Plate 87, and, as stated above, used therefor the\n\n\nspecial telephoto cameras with the rapid shutters Plate 89 is an\nexceedingly good view, and shows the propellers revolving very\nrapidly while Plates 90, 91 and 92 show very clearly that the speed of\nthe propellers had greatly decreased between the successive\nphotographs Plate 93 shows the aerodrome shortly after it touched\nthe water and had been almost completely submerged, in spite of its\nfloats, by the very strong tide which was running Though these plates\nshow all that photographs can, they give no adequate idea of the\nwonder and beauty of the machine when actually in flight For while\nthe graceful lines of the machine make it very attractive to the eye\neven when stationary, yet when it is actually in flight it seems\nveritably endowed with life and intelligence, and the spectacle holds\nthe observer awed and breathless until the flight is ended It seems\nhardly probable that anyone, no matter how skeptical beforehand,\ncould witness a flight of one of the models and note the almost bird-\nlike intelligence with which the automatic adjustments respond to\nvarying conditions of the air without feeling that, in order to traverse\nat will the great aerial highway man no longer needs to wrest from\nnature some strange, mysterious secret, but only, by diligent practice\nwith machines of this very type, to acquire an expertness in the\nmanagement of the aerodrome not different in kind from that\nacquired by every expert bicyclist in the control of his bicycle PL 86 QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME MOUNTED ON LAUNCHING-\nCAR ◊ lgr\nPL 87 QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME IN

    "93 QUARTER-SIZE MODEL AERODROME AT END OF FLIGHT,\nAUGUST 8, 1903\n◊\nIn describing this flight immediately after it was made, Professor\nJohn M Manly, who took the photograph shown in Plate 87, said:\n“The flight of the small aerodrome was an event which all who saw it\nwill remember for the rest of their lives We were, of course, in a state\nof considerable nervous excitement and tension, for, after weeks of\ndelay from high winds, rains, and [p261] other uncontrollable causes,\nat last we had a day ideally suited to the test This was, to be sure, not\nthe great test, the final test, the test of the man-carrying flyer, but it\nwas felt by all to be of almost equal importance, for if the balancing of\nthe small aerodrome was correct, the large one would maintain its\nequilibrium, and the problem of human flight would be solved\npractically as well as theoretically That the weather was now\nfavorable for the test filled us with excitement Again and again the\nfavorable moment had seemed to come, and had gone again before we\ncould make ready for it The aerodrome was rapidly carried to the\nupper works of the house-boat and the observers and helpers went\nhastily to their positions The large tug-boat was stationed directly\nahead, almost in the line of flight, and about a mile from the house-\nboat Signals of readiness were exchanged, and with every sense\nastrain we awaited the supreme moment The rocket gave the starting\nsignal, and instantly there rushed towards us, moving smoothly,\nwithout a quiver of its wings, with no visible means of motion and no\napparent effort, but with tremendous speed, the strange new\n\n\ninhabitant of the air Onward it moved, looking like a huge white\nmoth, but seeming no creature of this world, not only on account of\nits size, its ease of movement and its wonderful speed, but also\nbecause of its strange, uncanny beauty It seemed visibly and\ngloriously alive as it advanced, growing rapidly larger and more\nimpressive Straight at us it came, and for a moment there was a wild\nfear that it would come right on and crush itself against the ponderous\ntug-boat There was a half impulse to move the tug-boat out of its\nway, but the aerodrome seemed to realize its danger and rapidly,\nthough not abruptly or violently, as if it had intelligence and power of\nself-direction, it checked its speed and circled to the right, descending\nslightly Soon it quickened its speed again and went straight ahead for\nabout ten seconds, when it again checked its flight and descended,\ncircling once more Once again it attempted to increase its speed and\nrise, but it was too near the water, and in a few moments the waves\nhad wet its propellers and wings, and it sank, a poor, bedraggled\ncreature But the vision of its beauty and power and seeming\nintelligence and life will long remain with those who saw its flight ”\nAfter removing the model-launching track so that the final\narrangements could be completed for testing the large machine, many\nweeks of delay were experienced, almost entirely due to the unusually\nbad \nweather \nconditions \nwhich \nprevailed, \nand \nwhich \nwere\nunprecedented for the time of the year However, on September 3 the\nweather became more suitable, and the aerodrome being in readiness\nthe metal frame of the large machine was hoisted to the top of the\nboat and placed on the launching car, and the wings, rudder, etc ,\nwere then hoisted up and properly assembled and everything made\nready for a flight The parties with the telephoto cameras were sent to\ntheir stations on the shore, where definite base lines had been marked\nout so that with the data as to [p262] altitude and azimuth, which\nthese cameras automatically recorded, the speed, height, etc , of the\nmachine in flight could be accurately computed After stationing the\ntug-boats at proper points, so as to render assistance should the\naerodrome come down into the water at a considerable distance from\nthe house-boat, it was found, upon attempting to start the engine, that\nfor some reason it would not operate The sparking battery which had\nbeen placed at the extreme rear of the aerodrome was found to be\n\n\ngiving such a weak spark that it would not ignite the mixture in the\ncylinders Upon removing the connection which grounded the\nterminal of the battery to the framework and replacing it by a large\ncopper wire leading up to the engine so as to decrease the resistance\nof the circuit it was found that the battery still would not give\nsufficient spark A large quantity of dry cells, such as were used for\nthe engine, had been procured to insure against delay from lack of\nbatteries, but upon attempting to get a new set from this reserve\nsupply it was found that they, as well as the set that was on the\nmachine, had so deteriorated that instead of giving eighteen amperes\non short circuit they would give only three, which was not a sufficient\ncurrent to enable the engine to operate No shop tests on the large\nengine had been made since the large aerodrome had been brought\ndown the river, as no provision had been made for properly\nsupporting the aerodrome in the house-boat in such a way as to\npermit the large propellers to whirl around without causing damage,\nand, therefore, the batteries which had hitherto proved to be suitable\nhad not had any special test since they had been brought down the\nriver As no batteries suitable for use were on hand, and as none could\nbe procured from a point nearer than Washington, the test had to be\nabandoned for the day and the aerodrome removed to the interior of\nthe boat It was at first impossible to account for the rapid deterioration of so\nlarge a number of dry cells, but it was later found that the damp,\npenetrating fogs which had been experienced for nearly two months\nwere responsible for it, and that in order to preserve the batteries in\nsuch a climate it was necessary to place them in metallic boxes which\ncould be nearly, if not quite, hermetically sealed New batteries were\nimmediately procured from Washington, and before again mounting\nthe aerodrome on the launching track provision was made for testing\nthe engine inside the house-boat",
    "New batteries were\nimmediately procured from Washington, and before again mounting\nthe aerodrome on the launching track provision was made for testing\nthe engine inside the house-boat PL 94 94 HOISTING WING OF FULL-SIZE AERODROME ◊\nUp to this time the wings had been stored inside the house-boat by\nsuspending them from the ceiling, but the time required to hoist them\nto the upper works on top of the boat, after the main body of the\n\n\naerodrome had been placed on the launching car preparatory to\nmaking a flight, had added so greatly to the delay, and consequently\nto the difficulty of getting the machine entirely ready for a flight\nwhile the weather conditions remained suitable for a test, that it was\ndecided to build some framework on the upper works and cover it\nwith canvas so as to provide some boxes in which the wings could be\n[p263] stored whenever it seemed probable that a flight would soon be\npossible Some of the difficulties experienced in hoisting these wings\nfrom the interior of the boat to the upper works may be appreciated\nby an inspection of Plate 94, where one of them is seen just ready to\nbe hoisted from the raft Only one wing at a time could be handled on\nthe raft, even when there was no appreciable wind or roughness of the\nwater, so that in order to hoist all four wings the raft had to be hauled\naround from the door at the end of the boat to the side where the\nwing was hoisted, and back again four times every time the machine\nwas assembled preparatory to a flight The necessity for making\noccasional tests of the engine in order to make sure that no trouble\nwould be again experienced in having proper batteries, etc , for the\nengine when the machine was again on the point of being launched\nalso made it imperative to remove the wings from the interior of the\nhouse-boat, as the tremendous blasts of air from the propellers would\ncertainly have wrecked the wings had they remained in the boat while\nthe engine was being tested After the wings had been stored in the “wing boxes,” thorough tests\nof the engine were made, and before there came another day which\nwas at all suitable for a trial, it was accidentally discovered that the\nglued joints in the cross-ribs of the large wings had been softened by\nthe moisture of the fogs which had penetrated everything, and that\nthe joints had all opened up and left the ribs in a practically useless\ncondition It will be recalled from the description of these cross-ribs, Chapter\nVI ◊, that the rib is composed of two channel-shaped strips, the edges\nof which are glued together while the strips are bent over a form\nwhich causes the ribs to maintain the curved form desired after the\nglue has hardened Recalling these facts, it will be readily understood\nthat there is at all times a considerable strain on the glued joints due\nto the two strips of wood trying to straighten out, and, therefore, if\n\n\nthe glue should at any time become softened sufficiently to allow one\nstrip to slide along on the other, the joint would open up and the rib\nwould consequently become straight When the construction of the\nhollow ribs was first contemplated it was realized that although the\nhollow construction would enable the ribs to be strong, and at the\nsame time exceedingly light, yet it would make it imperative that the\nribs be covered with a water-proof varnish in order to prevent the\nglue from being softened when the aerodrome came down into the\nwater, as it was expected from the first that it would do at the end of\nits flight Considerable time and attention had, therefore, been given\nto this very problem of securing a suitable water-proof varnish, and\nribs coated with the varnish which was finally used had been\nsubmerged in water for more than 24 hours in testing this very point,\nand no softening of the glue could be detected after this long\nsubmergence It had, therefore, been felt that the ribs had been given\na test which was much more severe than any conditions which [p264]\nwere likely to be met with, since the aerodrome would, in no case\nwhich could be anticipated, be in the water for so long a period as 24\nhours, and no trouble from this source need be anticipated In the present case, however, the moisture of the atmosphere,\nwhich had been heavily laden with fog for several weeks, had\npenetrated the varnish and softened the glue, even though the\nsubmergence of 24 hours in water had shown no effect To construct\nnew ribs for the wings would have required several weeks, and the\ndelays which had already been experienced had by this time\nprolonged the stay down the river so greatly that even under the very\nbest conditions it seemed hardly possible to complete the tests before\nthe coming of the equinoxial storms, which would make it necessary\nto remove the boat from the middle of the river and place it in a safe\nharbor Something, therefore, had to be done, and that very quickly,\nso that an immediate test could be made, or else the tests would have\nto be delayed until the following season, or possibly postponed\nindefinitely on account of the lack of funds Owing to the varnish with which the ribs were covered, it was\nimpossible in repairing them to carry out the first plan which\nsuggested itself of binding the ribs with a strip of cloth impregnated\nwith glue and wound spirally from end to end As the wood was so\n\n\nvery thin, it was impossible to bind the two parts together with wire,\nand even thin bands of metal driven up on the tapered portion of the\nrib were not likely to draw the two strips together without crushing\nthe wood What was finally done was to scrape the edges of the two\nstrips where the joint had opened, thereby removing all the old glue,\nand after putting fresh glue on all these edges the two strips were\ndrawn together and bound with surgeons’ tape, which was found to\nadhere very firmly even to the varnished surface After repairing the ribs in this manner and readjusting the guy-\nwires of their framework so as to make the wing assume the correct\nform, which had been slightly altered by the warping and twisting\nconsequent on the opening up of the ribs, everything was again in\nreadiness for a test in free flight, numerous tests of the engine having\nmeanwhile been made both with the aerodrome frame inside of the\nhouse-boat and also when mounted on the launching track above The\nweather, which had been unprecedentedly bad all summer, now\nbecame even worse, and although short periods of calm lasting an\nhour or less occasionally occurred, there were for several weeks no\ncalm periods long enough for completing the necessary preparations\nand making a test, although the time required for assembling the\naerodrome had been greatly shortened by building the “wing boxes”\non the superstructure, and in other ways previously described On\nseveral occasions when an attempt was made to utilize what appeared\nto be a relative calm, the aerodrome was assembled on the launching\napparatus and everything got in readiness except the actual fastening\nof the [p265] wings and rudder to it, but in every instance, before the\nwings could be actually applied and a flight made, the wind became\nso strong as to absolutely prohibit a test On two occasions when the\nwings were actually attached, heavy rain storms suddenly came up\nand drenched the machine before the wings could be removed, and on\nseveral occasions it was necessary to leave the entire metal frame and\nengine of the aerodrome mounted on top of the boat all night,\nbecause the heavy sea which was running made it impossible to\nutilize the large raft in returning the frame to the interior of the boat Finally, however, after it seemed almost useless to hope for calm\nweather, what appeared to be a most propitious day arrived on\nOctober 7 The wind which had been quite high in the early morning\n\n\ngradually quieted until at 10 a m",
    "m it was blowing only about twelve\nmiles per hour and the indications were that it would quiet down still\nmore Every energy was concentrated in getting the aerodrome ready\nat the earliest possible moment, as previous experience had shown too\nclearly that the conditions might be completely reversed in less than\nan hour As the tide and wind caused the boat to swing up the river\nfrom its buoy, and thus made the launching track point down the\nriver, the steam tug-boat was sent down the river for a distance of a\nmile or more so that, should the aerodrome come down into the water\nwithout being able to make a return trip to the house-boat, the tug-\nboat would be able to reach it quickly and render assistance to both\nthe writer and the machine should they need it At 12 20 p m everything was in readiness and what appeared to be the decisive\nmoment had arrived, when the writer, after starting up the engine and\ngradually raising its speed to the maximum, and after taking the last\nsurvey of the whole machine to insure that everything was as it\nshould be, finally gave the orders to release it Although the writer did not have the privilege of seeing it glide\ndown the track, as his attention was too thoroughly engaged in\ninsuring that he was in the proper position for reaching immediately\nany of the control apparatus, either of the aerodrome or of the engine,\nyet those who did witness the actual passage of the machine down the\ntrack have said that the sight was most impressive and majestic No\nsign of jar was apparent when the machine was first released, but\nwith lightning-like rapidity it gathered its speed as it rushed down the\nsixty feet of track, the end of which it reached in three seconds, at\nwhich time it had attained a speed of something over thirty-two feet\nper second Just as the machine reached the end of the track the\nwriter felt a sudden shock, immediately followed by an indescribable\nsensation of being free in the air, which had hardly been realized\nbefore the important fact was intuitively felt that the machine was\nplunging downward at a very sharp angle, and he instinctively\ngrasped the wheel which controls the Pénaud tail and threw it to its\nuppermost extent in an attempt to depress the rear of the machine and\n[p266] thereby overcome the sharp angle of descent Finding that the\nmachine made no response to this extreme movement of the tail, he\nimmediately realized that a crash into the water was unavoidable and\n\n\nbraced himself for the shock The tremendous crash of the front wings\nbeing completely demolished as they struck the water had hardly\nbecome apparent before he found himself and the machine plunging\ndownward through the water By some instinct he grasped the main\nguy-wires which were above his head, and pulling himself through the\nnarrow space between them freed himself from the machine and\nswam upward as rapidly as possible A few moments after reaching\nthe surface of the water the uppermost point of the pyramid of the\nmachine was seen to project from the water and he swam over and sat\ndown on it until a row-boat could be sent to it from the nearby power-\nboat The first thing that the writer saw after looking around him was a\nnewspaper reporter, his boatman expending the utmost limit of his\npower in pushing his boat ahead to be the first one to arrive After giving directions to the workmen regarding the recovery of\nthe machine, the writer returned to the house-boat to obtain dry\nclothing, and although his first inclination was not to make any\nstatement until a complete examination could be made to determine\nboth the cause of the lack of success and also the extent of the damage\nwhich had been sustained by the machine, yet owing to the very great\npressure brought to bear by the press representatives who said that\nunless some statement was given out they would write their own\nconclusions as to the cause of the mishap, he finally gave out the\nfollowing statement:\nSTATEMENT MADE BY MR MANLY TO ASSOCIATED PRESS\n“It must be understood that the test to-day was entirely an experiment,\nand the first of its kind ever made The experiment was unsuccessful The\nbalancing, upon which depends the success of a flight, was based upon the\ntests of the models and proved to be incorrect, but only an actual trial of\nthe full-size machine itself could determine this My confidence in the\nfuture success of the work is unchanged I can give you no further\ninformation I shall make a formal report to Secretary Langley ”\nPL 95 FLIGHT OF LARGE AERODROME,\nOCTOBER 7, 1903\n◊\nPL 96 FLIGHT OF LARGE AERODROME,\nOCTOBER 7, 1903\n◊\n\n\nPHOTOGRAPH BY T W SMILLIE\nAfter recovering the machine the foreman of the workmen (Mr Reed) [who together with Mr McDonald were the only ones on top of\nthe boat when the launching actually took place], busied himself to\ndiscover what had caused the jerk to the machine at the moment it\nwas released, which had been immediately followed by the great\ndepression of the front end After some little time he discovered that\nthe upright guide at the extreme front of the launching car (which, as\nheretofore stated, was slotted to receive a metal lug projecting from\nthe end of the guy-post, and thus prevent the front end of the [p267]\nframework from being twisted by a side wind striking the machine\nwhile it was still on the launching car) had been distorted, the metal\ncap on it being stretched out of shape in a way which indicated that\nthe pin of the front guy-post had hung in the cap, and that the guy-\npost was not therefore free from this part of the car when the end of\nthe launching track dropped The shock which the writer felt at the\nmoment of launching and which had also been seen by others to occur\nwas thus conclusively shown to have been due to the falling track,\ndragging the front end of the machine down with it As the machine\nwas travelling forward and the car had been almost instantly brought\nto a standstill by its buffer pistons co-acting with the buffer cylinders\nat the foot of the track, this front guy-post had been pulled\nbackwards, and thus not only pulled the main guy-wires of the wings\nbackwards and thereby depressed the front edge of the front wings so\nthat they had no angle of inclination, but had also bent the front end\nof the metal framework downward,—effects which were discovered\nfrom the later examination of the frame and the guy-post itself From\nthe instantaneous photographs which were obtained, indisputable\nevidence was obtained that this was what actually occurred Referring\nto the photograph, Plate 95, which was taken by Mr G H Powell,\nSecretary of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, and which\nshows the machine just a few feet in front of the point where it was\nactually launched, it will at once be seen that the front end of the\nframe is bent downward and that the front guy-post instead of being\nparallel with the rear one has been deflected backward at the lower\nend through an angle of 30 degrees Referring further to the\nphotograph, Plate 96, which was taken at the same instant as the one\n\n\njust described, it will be seen that even this one, which is a view of\nthe machine as it passed almost directly over Mr Smillie’s head, most\nclearly shows the extreme extent to which the front wings had been\ndistorted, the rear edges of the wings near the frame having been\ntwisted up until they struck the cross-frame, and the outer ends being\nfree to twist had been forced up very much higher After completing the recovery of the machine and the examination\nas to the extent of the injuries it had sustained, and finding\nunquestionable evidence that the accident had been caused by the\nfront guy-post hanging in its guide block on the launching car, the\nworkmen were set to work straightening out and arranging the\nvarious parts, fittings and accessories, and cleaning up the engine\nwhich fortunately had sustained no injury whatever After a\nconsultation in Washington with Mr Langley, who had been unable to\nbe present at the experiment, both concerning what had already\noccurred and also what should be done regarding the future of the\nwork, and in view of the fact that the statement which the writer had\ngiven to the press representatives, immediately after the accident, had\nbeen made before there had been time to make an examination of the\nmachine itself, it was decided that it would be best to give to the press\n[p268] a short statement to correct the earlier one, and Mr Langley\naccordingly made public the following note:\n“Mr Langley states that he was not an eye witness of the experiment at\nWidewater yesterday, having been detained in Washington by business, but\nthat on the report of Mr Manly, immediately in charge, he is able to say\nthat the latter’s first impression that there had been defective balancing was\ncorrected by a minuter examination, when the clutch, which held the\naerodrome on the launching ways and which should have released it at the\ninstant of the fall, was found to be injured “The machinery was working perfectly and giving every reason to\nanticipate a successful flight, when this accident (due wholly to the\nlaunching mechanism) drew the aerodrome abruptly downward at the\nmoment of release and cast it into the water near the house-boat The\nstatement that the machine failed for lack of power to fly was wholly a\nmistaken one “The engine, the frame and all the more important parts were practically\nuninjured The engine is actually in good working order The damage done\nwas confined to the slighter portions, like the canvas wings and propellers,\nand these can be readily replaced “The belief of those charged with the experiment in the ultimate\nsuccessful working of the machine is in no way affected by this accident,\n\n\nwhich is one of the large chapter of accidents that beset the initial stages of\nexperiments so novel as the present ones It is chiefly unfortunate in coming\nat the end of the season when outdoor work of this sort is impossible “Whether the experiments will be continued this year or not has not yet\nbeen determined ”\nIn view of the many inaccurate accounts published in the daily\npress at the time of this experiment, special attention is directed to the\nfact that even under the enormous strain to which the aerodrome was\nsubjected, due to its striking the water at an angle of approximately\nforty-five degrees and at a speed certainly not less than forty miles an\nhour, no bending or distortion of any kind was found in the frame\nafter it was recovered, except that a slight depression at the front had\nbeen produced by the lower guy-post catching on the launching car,\nas previously described This is very clearly seen in Plate 97, Fig 1,\nwhich shows the aerodrome being hoisted from the water, and in\nPlate 97, Fig 2, which shows it just afterwards resting on the raft, the\nwings, tail and rudder having been completely demolished by towing\nit through the water to the house-boat from the place where it struck\nthe water This single distortion, therefore, was in no way a result of\nthe strains experienced by the frame either while it was in the air or\nwhen it struck the water Some of the press reports, and, in fact, some\nof the accounts published in the scientific press, stated that the\naerodrome frame had proved so weak that it broke while the machine\nwas in the air, and that this was the cause of the accident Nothing\ncould be farther from the actual facts than this, for though there were\nmany things connected with the machine which could not be properly\ntested until it was actually in the air, yet the strength of the frame had\nbeen most thoroughly [p269] tested in the shops prior to the trial, and\nit had been found that with the frame supported only at the extreme\nfront and rear, no appreciable deflection was produced upon it by the\nconcentrated weight of four men at the center, even when they\nsimultaneously jumped up and down on it That the aerodrome frame\nwas amply strong was further evidenced by the fact that in the later\ntrial, hereafter described, no injury was sustained by the frame even\nwhen the machine turned over in mid-air and struck the water flat on\nits back In fact, no point regarding the aerodrome is more certain\nthan that the frame was more than strong enough for its purpose Plates 98 to 100 show the aerodrome in the water from the\n\n\nmoment after it arose and the writer, who had extricated himself\nwhile it was plunging down through the water and beat it to the\nsurface, had swum over to it and sat down on the upper pyramid to\nawait a row-boat, until the machine was taken in tow by the tug-boat As the weather conditions were continually growing worse, owing\nto the lateness of the season, it was decided that it would be\nabsolutely impossible to undertake to keep the house-boat down the\nriver until the aerodrome could be repaired and another test made,\nand the writer accordingly returned to Quantico on the following day,\nexpecting to take the tug-boat from there to the house-boat and\ncomplete arrangements for bringing everything to Washington On\nreaching Quantico, however, it was found that a most violent storm\nwas raging on the river, and had, in fact, been increasing in violence\nsince the evening of October 7, immediately following the trial On\naccount of the storm it was impossible to reach the house-boat or to\nget into communication with the workmen, who had sought refuge at\nthe hotel at Clifton Beach, as the tug-boat itself was not at the point at\nwhich it was expected to be found, and, in fact, it had not been seen\nby any of the river people since the morning of October 8, when it\nwas seen taking the workmen from the boat to Clifton Beach Two\ndays later, or October 11, when the storm had subsided and the tug-\nboat, which had been blown many miles down the river, was able to\nreturn the workmen to the house-boat, it was found that the storm\nhad made a complete wreck of all the row-boats, the power-launch,\nand the large raft The row-boats had been completely demolished on\nthe beaches, the launch had been broken from its moorings to the\nhouse-boat and driven ashore some four miles down the river, where\nit was found with the deck torn completely off, a large hole stove in it\namidships, and the engine seriously damaged, while the raft had been\nvery seriously damaged on the beach many miles down the river After making temporary repairs to the raft and getting it launched, it\nwas used as a floating dock for making temporary repairs on the\npower-launch; both were then returned to their moorings at the\nhouse-boat and everything got in readiness for towing the house-boat\nto Washington, and this was finally accomplished on October 12 [p270] Even while the boat was en route some of the workmen were\nbusily engaged in the repair of the damaged parts, the others having\n\n\nbeen sent ahead to Washington to begin work on the construction of\nnew wings, so that another trial could be had at the earliest moment\nthat the weather would permit One extra pair of wings was on hand, but these had been stored in\nthe house-boat while it was down the river, and the damp weather,\nwhich had caused such serious damage to the cross-ribs of the wings\nwhich were actually used, had also so seriously affected the ribs of\nthese extra wings that it was necessary to discard some of them and\nrepair the others An extra Pénaud tail was on hand, as well as a\nsteering rudder, and it was estimated that unless some unforeseen\ndelay occurred the aerodrome would be ready for flight in three\nweeks After making a careful examination of the places on the river which\nseemed most available for an experiment, it was finally decided to\nmake the next test just off the Potomac Flats, at the junction of the\nmain body of the river and the Eastern Branch, the traffic on this part\nof the river, which would have been more dangerous and troublesome\nduring the summer, being quite light at this time of the year By\nmaking the experiment at this point it was possible to leave the house-\nboat at its dock until the weather seemed suitable and then have a\ntug-boat tow it to the exact point, which would be determined by the\nstate of the wind and the tide After more completely examining the condition of the framework of\nthe machine, and discussing and maturely deliberating on the causes\nwhich had led to the accident of October 7, the writer advised Mr Langley not to make any changes either in the machine itself or in the\nlaunching apparatus, except to remove the small lug from the metal\nrod which projected from the end of the guy-post, and which by\ncatching in its guide on the launching car had been the sole cause of\nthe accident The aerodrome was accordingly repaired so as to\nreproduce exactly the conditions which obtained at the time of the\nprevious experiment, except for this slight change, and it was again\nready for trial by the middle of November The weather, however, at\nthis time was very variable, there being at times comparatively quiet\nperiods which lasted for only an hour or less, which was not sufficient\ntime for procuring a tug-boat and towing the boat to the proper point,\nand then assembling the aerodrome and making a trial However,\n\n\nafter many days waiting, what appeared to be an exceptionally quiet\nday occurred on December 8, the wind quieting down by noon to such\nan extent that practically a dead calm prevailed Vigorous search was\nimmediately instituted for a tug-boat to tow the house-boat to the\npoint selected, but it was very late in the afternoon before one could\nbe procured, and by the time the boat arrived at the proper place\ndarkness was descending and a strong [p271] and exceedingly gusty\nwind had sprung up, and it seemed almost disastrous to attempt an\nexperiment",

    "[p272]\nMr Reed, the foreman, who was qualified to observe accurately,\nnot only through his having worked continuously for many years on\nthe machines, but also from his having witnessed the numerous tests\nof the models, states that from his position near the rear end of the\nlaunching track he noticed that at a point about ten feet before the\nmachine reached the end of the track the Pénaud tail seemed to have\ndropped at the rear end in some inexplicable way so that it was\ndragging against the cross-pieces of the track, and that at the next\ninstant, when the car reached the end of the track, he saw the\nmachine continue onward, but the rudder and whole rear portion of\nthe frame and the wings seemed to be dragging on the launching car Mr McDonald, the head machinist, states that he had his attention so\nconcentrated on the engine, which he noticed was working perfectly\nand driving the propellers at a higher rate of speed than he had ever\nbefore seen it do, that he did not see anything happen until he saw\nthe machine shoot upward in the air, gradually attaining a vertical\n\n\nposition with its bow upward, where it was sustained for a few\nmoments by the upward thrust of the propellers After a few moments,\nhowever, the strong wind, which was blowing from twelve to eighteen\nmiles an hour directly ahead and acting against the wings which were\nnow vertical, drove the machine backwards towards the house-boat,\nand he saw it come down into the water on its back, with the writer\ngradually righting himself in accordance with the turning of the\nmachine until he was finally hidden from view by the machine\ncoming down on top of him The witnesses on the tug-boats seem not\nto have been able to perceive exactly what occurred All unite in\nstating that something seemed to happen to the machine just a few\nfeet before the launching car reached the end of the track, but what it\nwas they could not say Everyone who saw the accident and who was\nsufficiently familiar with the construction of the machine to be able\nintuitively to form an idea as to just what was taking place was so\nvery close to the machine that when the accident happened\neverything seemed to merge into one vision, which was that of the\nwhole rear of the wings and rudder being completely destroyed as the\nmachine shot upward at a rapidly increasing angle until it reached the\nvertical position previously mentioned The writer can only say that from his position in the front end of\nthe machine, where he was facing forward and where his main\nattention was directed towards insuring that the engine was\nperforming at its best, he was unable to see anything that occurred at\nthe rear of the machine, but that just before the machine was freed\nfrom the launching car he felt an extreme swaying motion\nimmediately followed by a tremendous jerk which caused the\nmachine to quiver all over, and almost instantly he found the machine\ndashing ahead with its bow rising at a very rapid rate, and that he,\ntherefore, swung the wheel which controls the Pénaud tail to its\nextreme downward limit of motion Finding that [p273] this had\nabsolutely no effect, and that by this time the machine had passed its\nvertical position and was beginning to fall backwards, he swung\nhimself around on his arms, from which he supported himself, so that\nin striking the water with the machine on top of him he would strike\nfeet foremost The next few moments were for him most intense, for\nhe found himself under the water with the machine on top of him,\n\n\nand with his cork-lined canvas jacket so caught in the fittings of the\nframework that he could not dive downward, while the floor of the\naviator’s car, which was pressing against his head, prevented him\nfrom coming upward His one thought was that if he was to get out\nalive he would have to do so immediately, as the pressure of the\nwater on his lungs was beginning to make itself seriously felt Exerting\nall of the strength he could muster, he succeeded in ripping the jacket\nentirely in two and thus freeing himself from the fastenings which had\naccidentally held him, he dived under the machine and swam under\nthe water for some distance until he thought he was out from under\nthe machine Upon rising to the surface his head came in contact with\na block of ice, which necessitated another dive to get free of the ice Upon coming to the surface of the water he noticed Mr Hewitt, one of\nthe workmen, just about to plunge in; before he could call out to\nindicate he was safe, Mr Hewitt had heroically plunged in with the\nexpectation of diving under the machine where he believed the writer\nto be entangled Finding the house-boat was being rapidly shoved\nupon him, imperilling the life of both himself and Mr Hewitt, besides\nthe safety of the aerodrome, the writer gave orders that the tug-boat\nreverse and tow the house-boat away Then, with the assistance of a\nrow-boat, he reached the house-boat, where willing hands drew him\non board and assisted him into dryer and warmer clothing Meanwhile, it had become quite dark, and when the writer went\noutside to see about the aerodrome he found that the men on the tug-\nboat, in their zeal to render assistance, had fastened a rope to the rear\nend of the machine, at the same time pulling it in the direction in\nwhich the front end was pointed, and through their ignorance had\nforced it down into the muddy bottom of the river and broken the\nmain framework completely in two, thus rendering it absolutely\nimpossible with the facilities at hand to remove it from the water to\nthe interior of the boat It was finally necessary to tie the wrecked\nmachine to the stern of the house-boat and have the boat towed to its\ndock where the mast and boom were assembled and the wrecked\nmachine hoisted from the water This was finally accomplished about\nmidnight, when the workmen, who had been working at a fever heat\nall day, were glad to close up the work for the day, which had proved\nso unfortunate",

    "As has\nbeen previously stated, Mr Reed, who was at the rear of the\nlaunching track, states very positively that the rudder was dragging\non the track at least ten feet before the launching car reached the\nfront end of the track where the machine was actually launched There are several ways in which the rudder could have gotten down\non the track, but positive information is lacking If it was dragging on\nthe track, as Mr Reed states (and from his extended experience and\nrather acute powers of observation I should place great credence in\nhis report), the subsequent demolition of the guy-posts succeeded by\nthe destruction of the rear wings and serious injury of the front ones is\neasily explained If the dropping of the rudder on the track occurred\nfrom the breaking of the upper rudder post, over which the upper\ncontrol wire passed, the lower vertical surface would first come in\n\n\ncontact with the track, and the destruction of this part would certainly\noccasion subsequent destruction of the horizontal and upper vertical\nsurfaces of the rudder, leaving the central rib of the rudder still\nattached to the frame, and upon the machine being released from the\ncar a few moments later this destroyed rudder would easily catch in\nthe launching car and pull the aerodrome down on it, and thus cause\nthe destruction of the guy-posts, wings, and so forth If the dropping\nof the rudder was caused primarily by its main rib breaking loose\nfrom its connection with the frame, the rudder would still be dragged\nalong behind the machine by the wire cords through which it was\noperated, and the subsequent launching of the machine would still\ngive the rudder every chance to catch in the launching car and drag\nthe machine down on it It can therefore be said that, while positive information is lacking,\nthere is very strong evidence that the accident in the launching was\ndue to the rudder becoming entangled with the launching track owing\nto the breakage of some part of the mechanism by which it was\nconnected to the main frame It is of importance to note that the photograph furnishes\nincontrovertible evidence that the main frame of the machine was in\nno way injured, except for the slight bending of the forward curved\nextension, and that, therefore, the accident was in no way due to the\nweakness of the frame The main frame was not even injured by the\nmachine coming down in the water on its back, and the later damage\nwas entirely caused by the combination of the ignorance of the tug-\nboatmen and the darkness in which they were working, when they\nattempted to tow it to the rear of the house-boat so that it could be\nremoved from the water [p276]\nOn the day following the trial a very careful inspection was made in\nthe hope of obtaining some more definite information as to just what\ncaused the accident, but the serious injury to the machine caused by\nthe tug-boatmen breaking it in the water had so greatly tangled things\nup that it was impossible to tell anything about it The workmen were\nimmediately put to work removing fittings from the broken wings,\nrudder, etc , and dismounting the engine, which was immediately\nreassembled on its testing frame and found to be absolutely uninjured The transverse frame of the machine was comparatively uninjured,\n\n\nthe damage done by the men on the tug-boat being the breaking of\nthe machine in two at a point just back of the cross-frame, together\nwith the consequent destruction of the bearing points, “trestle,” and\ncertain fittings by which the main guy-wires were attached to the\nmain tubes and pyramids The situation which now existed was most distressing and\ndisheartening Mr",
    "Mr Langley felt that he could not approve of further\nexpenditures from any Smithsonian fund, and the Board of Ordnance\nand Fortification of the War Department having been severely\ncriticised on the floors of Congress for its original allotment for the\nwork, deemed it inexpedient to incur a possible curtailment of the\nfunds annually placed at its disposal for general experimental work\nthrough a manifestation of continued interest in the flying machine As has already been stated, representatives from the Board of\nOrdnance and Fortification of the War Department were present at\nboth tests of the large aerodrome; on October 7 Major Montgomery M Macomb and Mr G H Powell, and on December 7 General W F Randolph accompanied by Major Macomb and Mr Powell,\nrepresented the War Department, and Dr F S Nash, at that time\nContract Surgeon, U S A , was officially present at both trials to\nrender medical assistance should it be needed By permission of the War Department, the official report of the tests\nsubmitted by Major Macomb to the Board of Ordnance and\nFortification is here made public:\nEnc 1st to 3d end’t, BOF 6191 REPORT\nExperiments with working models which were concluded August 8 last\nhaving proved the principles and calculations on which the design of the\nLangley aerodrome was based to be correct, the next step was to apply\nthese principles to the construction of a machine of sufficient size and\npower to permit the carrying of a man, who could control the motive power\nand guide its flight, thus pointing the way to attaining the final goal of\nproducing a machine capable of such extensive and precise aerial flight,\nunder normal atmospheric conditions, as to prove of military or commercial\nutility Mr C M Manly, working under Prof Langley, had, by the summer of\n1903, succeeded in completing an engine-driven machine which under\nfavorable [p277] atmospheric conditions was expected to carry a man for\nany time up to half an hour, and to be capable of having its flight directed\nand controlled by him The supporting surface of the wings was ample, and experiment showed\n\n\nthe engine capable of supplying more than the necessary motive power Owing to the necessity of lightness, the weight of the various elements\nhad to be kept at a minimum, and the factor of safety in construction was\ntherefore exceedingly small, so that the machine as a whole was delicate\nand frail and incapable of sustaining any unusual strain This defect was to\nbe corrected in later models by utilizing data gathered in future\nexperiments under varied conditions One of the most remarkable results attained was the production of a\ngasoline engine furnishing over fifty continuous horse-power for a weight of\none hundred and twenty pounds The aerodrome, as completed and prepared for test, is briefly described\nby Prof Langley as “built of steel, weighing complete about seven hundred\nand thirty pounds, supported by one thousand and forty feet of sustaining\nsurface, having two propellers driven by a gas engine developing\ncontinuously over fifty brake horse-power ”\nThe appearance of the machine prepared for flight was exceedingly light\nand graceful, giving an impression to all observers of being capable of\nsuccessful flight On October 7 last everything was in readiness, and I witnessed the\nattempted trial on that day at Widewater, Va , on the Potomac",
    ", on the Potomac The engine\nworked well and the machine was launched at about 12 15 p m The trial\nwas unsuccessful because the front guy-post caught in its support on the\nlaunching car and was not released in time to give free flight, as was\nintended, but on the contrary, caused the front of the machine to be\ndragged downward, bending the guy-post and making the machine plunge\ninto the water about 50 yards in front of the house-boat The machine was\nsubsequently recovered and brought back to the house-boat The engine\nwas uninjured and the frame only slightly damaged, but the four wings and\nrudder were practically destroyed by the first plunge and subsequent\ntowing back to the house-boat This accident necessitated the removal of\nthe house-boat to Washington for the more convenient repair of damages This accident necessitated the removal of\nthe house-boat to Washington for the more convenient repair of damages On December 8 last, between 4 and 5 p m m , another attempt at a trial\nwas made, this time at the junction of the Anacostia with the Potomac, just\nbelow Washington Barracks On this occasion General Randolph and myself represented the Board of\nOrdnance and Fortification On this occasion General Randolph and myself represented the Board of\nOrdnance and Fortification The launching car was released at 4 45 p m ,\nbeing pointed up the Anacostia towards the Navy Yard My position was on\nthe tug Bartholdi about 150 feet from and at right angles to the direction of\nproposed flight The car was set in motion and the propellers revolved\nrapidly, the engine working perfectly, but there was something wrong with\nthe launching The rear guy-post seemed to drag, bringing the rudder down\non the launching ways, and a crashing, rending sound, followed by the\ncollapse of the rear wings, showed that the machine had been wrecked in\nthe launching, just how, it was impossible for me to see The fact remains\nthat the rear wings and rudder were wrecked before the machine was free\nof the ways Their collapse deprived the machine of its support in the rear,\nand it consequently reared up in front under the action of the motor,\nassumed a vertical position, and then toppled over to the rear, falling into\nthe water a few feet in front of the boat",

    "The repairs having been\ncompleted, on December 8, 1903, another attempt at a trial was made, this\ntime at the junction of the Anacostia and the Potomac Rivers General W F Randolph and Major Macomb, members of the Board, and Mr Powell, were\npresent Major Macomb reported as follows:\n“The launching car was released at 4 45 p m The car was set in motion\nand the propellers revolved rapidly, the engine working perfectly, but there was\nsomething wrong with the launching The rear guy-post seemed to drag, bringing\nthe rudder down on the launching ways, and a crashing, rending sound, followed\nby the collapse of the rear wings, showed that the machine had been wrecked in\nthe launching, just how, it was impossible for me to see ”\nMarch 3, 1904, the Board stated that it was not “prepared to make an\nadditional allotment at this time for continuing the work,” whereupon\nDoctor Langley requested that arrangements be made for a distribution of\nthe aerodrome material procured jointly from funds allotted by the Board\nand by the Smithsonian Institution Doctor Langley was informed that all of\nthe material would be left in his possession and available for any future\nwork that he might be able to carry on in connection with the problem of\nmechanical flight That this refusal of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification to\nrender further assistance to the work was due to the fear that such\naction would result in a curtailment of their appropriation by\nCongress is clearly shown by the following extract from the official\nreport of the Board on November 14, 1908, to the Secretary of War:\nAERIAL NAVIGATION\nFor a number of years the Board has been interested in the subject of\naerial navigation, and as long ago as 1898 made allotments to carry on\nexperiments with a machine of the heavier-than-air type, under the\ndirection of the late Dr S P Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian\n\n\nInstitution, who had made exhaustive experiments in aerodynamics,48 and\nwho had demonstrated the practicability of mechanical flight by the\nsuccessful operation of engine-driven models The many problems and mechanical difficulties met with in the\ndevelopment of the full-size machine have been set forth in the various\npublished statements49 [p280] of Doctor Langley, and the unsuccessful\noutcome of the experiments is too well known to require reiteration It may\nbe said, however, that at the time of the trials the Board was of the opinion\nthat the failure of the aerodrome to successfully operate was in no manner\ndue to the machine itself, but solely to accidents in the launching\napparatus, which caused the wreck of the aerodrome before it was in free\nflight Doctor Langley considered it desirable to continue the experiments, but\nthe Board deemed it advisable, largely in view of the adverse opinions\nexpressed in Congress and elsewhere, to suspend operations in this\ndirection These adverse opinions expressed in Congress were wholly due to\nthe bitter criticism by the newspapers, whose hostility was\nengendered by Mr Langley’s refusal to admit their representatives to\nthe shops and house-boat where the work was in progress Mr",
    "Mr Langley had at all times tried to make his position in the matter clear\nto the newspapers, but, on August 19, 1903, at the time of one of his\nvisits to the experimental station near Widewater, Va , he found the\nnewspaper representatives so persistent in their misrepresentations of\nhis reasons for excluding them that he gave out the following\nstatement, which was published at that time:\nSMITHSONIAN\nINSTITUTION\n,\nWASHINGTON\n, D C ,\nAugust 19, 1903 TO\nTHE\nPRESS\n: The present experiments being made in mechanical flight have been\ncarried on partly with funds provided by the Board of Ordnance and\nFortification and partly from private sources, and from a special\nendowment of the Smithsonian Institution The experiments are carried on\nwith the approval of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution The public’s interest in them may lead to an unfounded expectation as to\ntheir immediate results, without an explanation which is here briefly given These trials, with some already conducted with steam-driven flying\nmachines, are believed to be the first in the history of invention where\nbodies, far heavier than the air itself, have been sustained in the air for\n\n\nmore than a few seconds by purely mechanical means In my previous trials, success has only been reached after initial failures,\nwhich alone have taught the way to it, and I know no reason why the\nprospective trials should be an exception It is possible, rather than probable, that it may be otherwise now, but\njudging them from the light of past experience, it is to be regretted that the\nenforced publicity which has been given to these initial experiments, which\nare essentially experiments and nothing else, may lead to quite unfounded\nexpectations It is the practice of all scientific men, indeed of all prudent men, not to\nmake public the results of their work till these are certain This\nconsideration, and not any desire to withhold from the public matters in\nwhich the public is interested, has dictated the policy thus far pursued here The fullest publicity, consistent with the national interest (since these\nrecent experiments have for their object the development of a machine for\nwar purposes), will be given to this work when it reaches a stage which\nwarrants publication (Signed ) S P LANGLEY [p281]\nAlthough it was impossible to immediately find funds for actively\ncontinuing the work, the writer finally, after some delay, persuaded\nMr Langley to allot a small sum from a limited fund which personal\nfriends had some time previously placed at his disposal for use in any\nexperiments he might wish to make This small sum was used to meet\nthe expense of the workmen who were kept employed long enough to\ncompletely repair the main frame so that, should further experiments\nbe possible at a later time, there would be no danger of important\nparts and fittings having been lost in the meantime, and even if no\nfurther experiments were made the frame would be in such condition\nthat others could profit from an examination of it, the frame itself\nembodying the solution of many important problems which had cost\nmuch time and money In the spring of 1904, after the repairs to the main frame were well\nunder way, the writer on his own initiative undertook to see what\ncould be done towards securing for Mr Langley’s disposal the small\nfinancial assistance necessary to continue the work; but he found that\nwhile a number of men of means were willing to assist in the\ndevelopment of the aerodrome, provided arrangements were made for\nlater commercialization, yet none were ready to render the assistance\n\n\nfrom a desire to assist in the prosecution of scientific work Many\nyears prior to this Mr Langley had had some very tempting\npropositions made to him by certain business men with a view to\ncarrying on the work in a way that would lead to later commercial\ndevelopment He had never patented anything previously in his life,\nand although many friends had urged that it was only proper that he\nshould patent whatever of value had been developed in connection\nwith the aerodromes, he steadfastly refused to do so He had given his\ntime and his best labors to the world without hope of remuneration,\nand he could not bring himself at his stage of life to consent to\ncapitalize his scientific work Success seemed only a step away, and\nhis age was such that any delay in achieving success increased the\nprobability of his not living to see it, but he maintained positively and\nresolutely that, if neither the War Department nor others felt sufficient\ninterest in the work to provide the small amount of funds necessary to\ncontinue the experiments, and they therefore could be continued only\nby his giving in and permitting his work to be capitalized, he would\nhave to deny himself the hope of living to see the machine achieve\nsuccess The result is well known to all PRESENT\nSTATUS\nOF THE\nWORK\nThe completely repaired frame of the large machine is now stored\nin one of the workshops at the Smithsonian Institution The large\nengine, the steam-driven models Nos 5 and 6, and the quarter-size\nmodel, driven by the three [p282] horse-power gasoline engine, are on\nexhibition at the U S National Museum The launching-car and a\nsmall amount of materials have also been stored away The large\nhouse-boat, the construction and maintenance of which proved such a\nserious drain on the finances, and the preservation of which would\nhave entailed the continuance of heavy fixed charges, has been turned\nover to the War Department and sold, as has also the power-launch\nand other paraphernalia which it seemed useless to preserve The writer is firmly convinced that the aerodrome is not only\ncorrect in principle but that it possesses no inherent faults or\n\n\nweaknesses, and that the success which the work deserves has been\nfrustrated by two most unfortunate accidents in the launching of the\nmachine Other plans of launching, several of which were studied out\nduring the early stages of the work on the large machine, would have\navoided the accident which did occur, but, of course, might have\nproduced others possibly even more disastrous, but which could be\ndetermined only by actual trial But even recognizing certain\nfundamental weaknesses of the launching mechanism as used, he\nbelieves that there is no inherent reason why the machine should not\nhave been successfully launched, and that the accidents which proved\nso disastrous in the two experiments were not such as should cause a\nlack of confidence in the final success of the aerodrome It might be of interest to add that the writer is now preparing to\nresume the work at the earliest opportunity, and that the machine will\nbe used in practically the form in which it existed at the two previous\nexperiments, though a slight change will be made permitting\nexperiments over the land rather than the water The only thing that\nprevents an immediate resumption is the pressure of private business\nmatters Before closing this record the writer wishes to acknowledge the\nvery valuable assistance in the work rendered by Mr Richard\nRathbun, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, through\nhis moral support and interest in it at all times, and especially during\nthe trying days of the summer of 1903; by Captain I N Lewis, who,\nwhile Recorder of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification from 1898\nto 1902, manifested keen interest in the work and gave it his moral\nsupport before the Board; by Professor John M Manly, who devoted\nthe whole of the summer of 1903 to it;

    "By advice of Captain Ferber, Blériot reduced the pitch of his propeller to\n0 90 m , so that the motor could give all its force This modification was an important one for his aeroplane From that\nmoment every trial marked an advance On July 12, he made a flight of 30\nm , and the aviator was able to show that the lateral stability was perfect On July 15, the trial was made against a wind of 6 miles an hour, but gave\ngood results He made a flight of 80 m , showing, however, that the hind\npart of the aeroplane was too heavy In this flight he arose as high as a\nsecond story, and on landing the wheels and one propeller were somewhat\ndamaged On July 24, repairs having been completed, a new trial was made This\ntime, in order to remedy the defect in the balance, Blériot had moved his\nseat forward about 80 cm The correction was too great, for on that day the\naeroplane, although the hind part arose, was not able to leave the ground On July 27, after having mounted the seat on wheels as skiffs, Blériot\nresumed the trials and made a flight of 120 m , at first moving his seat back\nand then, after getting started, bringing it forward Blériot had not provided\n\n\nthis aeroplane with an elevating rudder, but, following the example of\nLilienthal, changed the center of gravity of the apparatus by moving his\nown person, and after having established the proper angle remained\nimmovable on his seat In order to arise or descend, the aviator made use of\nthe spark lever, thus varying the number of turns of the propeller During a second trial on the same day, having accidently reached the\nlimit of the aviation field, Blériot, without allowing himself to be surprised\nand obliged to descend, decided to attempt a turn by maneuvering the\nsteering rudder [p284] and to return again to the center of the field With\nmarvelous precision, the aeroplane began to describe a circle of about 200\nm radius, inclining as if on a banked track Having finished the flight, he\nquickly regained his balance still in the direction of the wind, but on\naccount of a slight movement of the aviator, the aeroplane fell to such an\nextent that he was obliged to land He landed gently and without shock,\nrolling on his wheels On August 1, he made another flight of 100 m in\n6\n1\n2\nseconds; and on the 6th, one of 265 m with one interruption While the\nattention of the pilot was distracted for a moment, the aeroplane, which\nwas flying at a height of 2 or 3 m above the ground, touched the soil with\nits sustaining wheels at the end of 122 m and then immediately arising,\ncovered the remaining 143 m at a height of 12 m Blériot, moving forward\ntoo quickly, caused the aeroplane to descend swiftly to the ground, and the\nshock broke the axle and the blades of the propeller were bent In order to\nconfirm this account, we reproduce what was said in the “Auto” of August\n7, 1907 “M",
    "“M Blériot, continuing the trials of his aeroplane yesterday, surpassed\nthe superb results which he had already obtained The trial took place at 2\no’clock in the afternoon on the aviation field of Issy After a sustained flight\nof about 122 m at a height of 2 m , the aeroplane touched the ground,\nwithout stopping, however, and set out again almost immediately at a\nheight of 12 m and traversed about 143 m M Blériot, who for the time\nhad no other means of balancing but by moving his body, then moved a\nlittle forward to stop the ascent The aeroplane plunged forward, and in the\nfall the propeller was damaged and the axle broken “M Blériot, whose courage as a sportsman equals his learning as an\nengineer, was fortunately uninjured An inspection of the apparatus showed\nthat one blade of the propeller was bent, which was sufficient to prevent\nthe maneuver made by the aviator having its desired effect and contributed\nto the fall The engine will be repaired without difficulty and the trials will\nbe resumed Friday ”\nOn August 10, he made a flight of 80 m , but the motor was not in perfect\norder, so Blériot did not make other trials He decided, however, to\nsubstitute definitely a 50 HP motor for the 24 HP motor with which he\nmade all the experiments above reported, which were of a character to\nencourage the most sanguine expectations Ferber advised Blériot to adopt an elevating rudder also, because the\n\n\neffect produced by changing the position of the center of gravity, although\nefficacious is very difficult and delicate to control The conclusion of an article by Ferber in “Nature” of August 10, is\nworthy of note He says: “Let us remark, in conclusion, how fruitful is the\nmethod of personal trial which we have always advised in preference to any\ncalculation This year, with his fourth apparatus, Blériot has not met with\nany damage to his aeroplane He made the trials himself and they quickly\nled to results, because each trial gave him an exact idea of what was to be\ncorrected That is the condition of success ”\n\n\n\n\n◊\n[p285]\nAPPENDIX\nSTUDY OF THE AMERICAN BUZZARD AND THE “JOHN CROW”\nIn the preparation of this Memoir, the writer has deemed it best to\ngenerally omit any mention of plans and ideas which were brought\nforth in the work, unless constructions or tests in accordance with\nthem were carried to a sufficient extent to admit of some definite\nconclusion regarding them",

    "Mr Langley considered it not practicable or best to attempt to\nimitate the details of construction of the flying mechanism of birds At\nthe same time, he strongly believed that much was to be learned from\nthem about the practical side of the art of balancing, and he therefore\nspent a great deal of time both in analyzing the methods practiced by\nthe birds in preserving their equilibrium and in criticizing his own\nplans in this direction in the light of what Nature would seem likely to\ndo if she had to construct a flying creature on such a large scale In\ncarrying on his investigations in the art as practiced by the birds, he\nmade a trip to Jamaica during the early weeks of 1900, in order to\nstudy the species of buzzard which are so numerous and tame there\nand are known locally as the “John Crow ” After his return from this\ntrip he wrote the following very interesting letter to Mr Robert\nRidgway, requesting certain data regarding the American buzzard,\nwhich he wished to compare with some data on the “John Crow”\nwhich he had obtained on this trip:\n\n\nMARCH\n29, 1900 DEAR\nMR RIDGWAY\n:\nI have just returned from Jamaica, where among other occupations, I\nhave been studying the evolutions of the buzzard locally called the “John\nCrow,” a soaring bird which is almost as much superior in skill to our\nbuzzard as that is to a barn-yard fowl in its power of keeping itself in the\nair without flapping its wings, in what is very nearly a calm I have observed particularly the following points with the Jamaica\nspecimen (which I can only give, however, approximately), and I should\nlike to have you give corresponding ones for our Washington buzzard if you\ncan oblige me [p286]\nI note here that the measurements were made on a live bird and that it\nwas impracticable to get the separate weight of the wings except by\nestimate, but the two wings may be estimated collectively as\n1\n1\n4\nlbs , the whole weight being\n2\n3\n4\nlbs to 3 lbs Approximate values:\nWeight of the bird complete, 3 pounds Length of bird, 23 inches Spread of wings from tip to tip, 5 ft 5 in Complete curtate area of both wings (that is, the area of the shadow of\nthe bird’s wings when these are fully extended under a vertical sun) is\n600 square inches, or nearly 4 sq ft , consequently each square foot of\nthe bird’s sustaining surface carries\n3\n4\nlbs Diedral angle nearly 150° When the bird is soaring in a nearly calm atmosphere, which it\ninexplicably does,—soaring I mean nearly in line of the observer’s eyes and\ncoming directly to of going directly away from him,—it presents nearly the\nfollowing appearance:\nFIG 1—Jamaica, Mch 22, 1900 “John Crow ” Sketch soaring horizontally, by W H Holmes Weight 3 lbs Total wings area = 546 in

4 —Average typical position of wings in soaring gull From memory by S P Langley (The scale here may be taken approximately at\n1\n13\n) [p287]\nI must preface what follows by a little statement of the things which\nparticularly interest me here and which are not a naturalist’s ordinary\nconcern First, I want to know the CG of the bird when in flight You will\nunderstand that though there is but one center of gravity (here symbolized\nas CG), it may be considered (1) with reference to its position on the\nhorizontal plan of the bird with wings extended, when it will always be\nfound somewhere in the medial vertical plane, passing through the body,\nand usually nearly at a certain point with reference to length, the position\nthus considered being called CG, or (2) the position of the same CG with\nreference to a vertical plane passing transversely through the medial line,\nthe position thus considered being called CG2 In the latter case you will\nunderstand that the CG which is that of the whole body, wings and all, will\nbe carried more or less upward when the wings are thrown high up, and\nwill be carried temporarily downward when the wings are at their lowest\npoint of the stroke It would have a certain position when the bird was at\nrest and another position when it was soaring and the wings were above the\nbody The soaring bird is chiefly held upward by the pressure of the air under\neach wing, and just as the common center of gravity is a point where all the\nefforts of gravity are supposed to be centered, so there is a common center\nof pressure, or one point where

line\nthrough the CG, and usually above it",
    "The soaring bird is chiefly held upward by the pressure of the air under\neach wing, and just as the common center of gravity is a point where all the\nefforts of gravity are supposed to be centered, so there is a common center\nof pressure, or one point where all the efforts of the upper pressure of the\nair may be supposed to be centered, and it will be clear, on very little\n\n\nconsideration that this latter point must be always nearly in a vertical line\nthrough the CG, and usually above it Call it CP CG1 and CP1 are then, the symbols of CG and CP as referred to the\nhorizontal plane CG2 and CP2 are the symbols for the corresponding ones\nwhen referred to their position in the vertical plane I shall be glad to explain to you, if you are not familiar with it, the simple\nmethod of finding the CG1 and CG2 It consists in bending the wings into\njust the position that they would ordinarily occupy above the body in plain\nsoaring flight, keeping them there by a very light bent stick or wire, then\nhanging the bird up by a line attached to the tip of one wing, and see where\nthis line would pass through the body of the bird, for the CG will be\nsomewhere in this line After marking then, on the body of the bird its\nposition, hang it up a second time by the head or tail and note again where\nthe new vertical line runs in the new position There is but one CG and but\none point in which two straight lines can cross, and that will be the CG\nnecessarily Note with all care just where this is above or below the center\nof the body of the bird As for the CP for either wing, that may be nearly found by tracing the\nwing on a flat piece of thick paper or cardboard strong enough not to bend\nmuch—cutting out the tracing and balancing it well on the point of a pencil\n—the point about which it balances is very near CP2 or the center of\npressure in the vertical plane There is such a point of course in each wing,\nand when they are thrown up in the actual position that they have in calm\nsoaring flight, we may suppose a horizontal line drawn between them, and\nit is the distance from this horizontal line to CG2 compared with the area of\nthe wings or with the distance between their extended tips which we want\nto know, which gives the vertical distance which the CG is below the CP,\nthe thing we want to know It will be very convenient also to have a wing dissected from the body\nand the wing itself held in about the soaring curve by a bit of light stick\nbalanced on a pencil point, which will give the CG of the wing as distinct\nfrom that of the body However, the three things I principally want, beside\na sketch or [p288] photograph of the bird from about its own level coming\ndirectly toward or going directly away in soaring flight, are these:\nApproximate weight of the bird,—and approximate tracing of its\nextended wing with the area, so that we can tell the area of the supporting\nsurface relative to the weight, and finally, the distance between CP2, and\nCG2, which is obtainable by the process which I have explained I am afraid that what I have just been describing at such length may have\na certain obscurity to you, but if you will give me an opportunity, I shall be\npleased to illustrate it with the actual experiment when the bird is hung up\nby a string, and you will see that it is in reality simple Referring to the sketches on page 3 of this communication, a and b\ncorrespond to the centers of pressure on either wing where the upward\npressure of the air distributed over each wing may be supposed to be\ngathered in a single point This, as I have said, is called the center of\npressure with reference to the vertical flight, and its symbol is CP2, while\nthe horizontal dotted line between them represents the level of CP2, from\nthe best estimate that I could make when the wings are in their natural\n\n\nposition of soaring It is evident that this line passed far above the body of\nthe vulture, and if (the corresponding symbol for the height of the center of\ngravity being CG2), the CG2, of the entire bird be taken, it will be found to\nlie nearly in the point c Where c is in the present case, I could not\ndetermine exactly in my hasty examinations in the live bird, but I assume\nthat it is about\n1\n2\nway between the central horizontal axial line of the bird’s body and the\nupper portion I repeat that it is important to me to know what the vertical\ndistance is between CP2 and CG2 in each specimen of soaring bird I may\nobserve in illustration that in the common sea-gull, it is nearly as shown in\nthe faint sketch; that is to say, that the corresponding line a b in the soaring\ngull passes distinctly through the upper part of the body, and the distance\ndown to the CG2 of the whole in the gull is almost nil, while in the buzzard\nit is very considerable as shown by the corresponding distance in the “John\nCrow ”\nNow, what I want to get from you is the corresponding figures for an\naverage specimen of our Washington buzzard If you will kindly have one\nkilled and weighed while fresh, and before the rigor-mortis has set in, first\nnoting the position of its wings when soaring in a calm, and (if possible)\nwhen coming toward you or going away in about a horizontal plane with\nyour eye, in which position the wings will be elevated and bent somewhat\nas in the case of the above sketch of the “John Crow”; if you will kindly do\nthis, so as to give me corresponding facts with reference to the buzzard,\nnamely weight, area of extended wing surface, distance between tips as\nbent up in ordinary flight, distance between extended tips, the quantity\nCP2−CG2, and also will make such a tracing of the buzzard’s wing as Mr Manly will show you of the “John Crow’s,” I shall be obliged My impression is that the buzzard is a considerably heavier bird than the\n“John Crow,” without, however, very much greater spread of wing I may\nobserve that when the wings of the Jamaica bird were spread out, they\nwere spread quite to their utmost extent, and the distance between the tips\nof the terminal feathers was much greater than when in flight I wish you\nwould kindly also add the scientific name of the “John Crow,” with any\nparticulars that you would think of interest If there be any special expenses incurred in the preparation of this\nmemorandum, including the time of a photographer, I will direct them to\nbe paid from the Smithsonian fund [p289]\nIf you could get Mr Holmes (who made most of the sketches and all of\nthe photographs of the “John Crow”), to try and do something like this for\nyour buzzard, especially getting such a photograph of it in flight, as will give\nthe position of its center of gravity relative to the center of pressure on the\nwings, it would add very greatly to the value of your memoranda, and I\nthink Mr Holmes takes so full and intelligent an interest in the subject, that\nhe might be pleased to give his help Very truly yours,\nS P LANGLEY\n\n\n,\nSecretary MR ROBERT\nRIDGWAY\n,\nSmithsonian Institution,\nCurator, Division of Ornithology, U S National Museum, Washington,\nD C In response to this request, Mr Ridgway submitted the following\nvery interesting information:\nSMITHSONIAN\nINSTITUTION\n,\nUNITED\nSTATES\nNATIONAL\nMUSEUM\nWASHINGTON\n, D C , October 16, 1900 PROF S P LANGLEY\n,\nSecretary, Smithsonian Institution SIR\n:\nI have the honor of submitting herewith the data obtained by Mr Rolla P Currie concerning measurements, etc , of the common Turkey Buzzard\n(Cathartes aura) of the United States, as requested by you in your letter of\nMarch 29, last The difficulties in the way of securing these data, already explained by\nme in previous communications, are responsible for the delay in submitting\nthem Hoping that this material may prove of use to you, I am,\nVery respectfully,\nR RIDGWAY\n,\nCurator, Division of Birds MEMORANDA\nIN\nREGARD\nTO THE\nTURKEY\nBUZZARD\n(\n\n\nSECOND\nSPECIMEN\n)\n1 Weight —1850 grammes 2 Area of outstretched wings —641 square inches (Computed from three\nsheets of tracings, A1 and A2 comprising the entire area of both wings;

    "FOOTNOTES [37]\n“The Flying Machine” McClure’s Magazine, June, 1897 [38]\nOne noted astronomer and mathematician re-affirmed this opinion as late\nas 1900 and even stated that man could not hope to construct a flying\nmachine capable of sustaining a weight as great as our largest birds,\nknowing that even at that time the model Aerodromes Nos 5 and 6 had\nalready done more than this 5 and 6 had\nalready done more than this [39]\nThese wings are described in Chapter VI, pp 191 [40]\nSee “Experiments in Aerodynamics ” It will be recalled that in the\nexperiments with the “plane-dropper” there was a greatly reduced lifting\npower with superposed planes when their distance apart was one-half the\nwidth the planes, unless a speed of about 42 5 feet a second was obtained In the above tests with the superposed wings, the speed was only from\ntwenty to twenty-two feet a second at the time of launching, and as the\ndistance between the surfaces was only one-half as great as their width, it is\nnot surprising that the lifting power should not be as great as with the\n“single-tier” wings [41]\nIn fact the setting of the tail at a negative angle and fastening it to the\nframe by an elastic or spring connection was only begun in 1896, and while\nit proved to be the key to the solution of the problem of automatic\nlongitudinal stability, yet it was not at that time so recognized, although\nthe first real test of the aerodromes after the elastic connection and\nnegative angle of the tail were adopted resulted in the epoch-making flight\nof No 5 on May 6 By comparing the angle of the tail on No 5 in Plate\n27A, Part I, with the angle of the tail on No 6 in Plate 27B, Part I, it will be\nseen that while the first had an angle of much less than 5 degrees, the latter\nhad an angle of about 15 degrees But the wooden springs changed so that\nit was not accurately known what the angle really was at the time at either\nflight in 1896 [42]\nThe drawings, Plate 55, which illustrate many of the fittings used on the\nframe, show the guy-wires as attached by means of loops twisted in their\nends, these drawings having been made before the final plan of attaching\nthe wires had been devised [43]\nSee explanation of system of locating points in Part I, Chap II, p 15 [44]\nSee Balancing of Engines, by Archibald Sharpe [45]\nExcept for a ten minute stop to renew the supply of lubricating oil and\nchange the sparking batteries [46]\n\n\nSee foot-note, page 249 [47]\nThe weight was afterwards increased to 850 pounds due to repairing the\nwings and adding more sparking batteries [48]\nSee \nExperiments \nin \nAerodynamics, \nSmithsonian \nContributions \nto\nKnowledge, Vol 27, Washington 1891 [49]\nResearches and Experiments in Aerial Navigation, Smithsonian Publication\nNo 1809, Washington, 1908 [50]\nAll these minimum permissible conditions are connected by the tacit\nassumption that the supporting area is not greatly over 2 ft to the pound of\nweight If for instance the weight were increased by larger wings or more\nwings, furnishing a much greater supporting area per pound, these\nconditions would not necessarily apply",
    "If for instance the weight were increased by larger wings or more\nwings, furnishing a much greater supporting area per pound, these\nconditions would not necessarily apply [51]\nThese tables were later designated as “Data Sheets ” Several copies, with\nthe data duly entered on them, are given in this appendix, and the form\nwhich Mr Langley included in this letter is therefore not repeated here —\nEDITOR ◊\n[p297]\nDATA SHEETS DATA SHEET No 1 Weight of Aerodrome No 5, as photographed on May 11, 1896 5, as photographed on May 11, 1896 Certified to by R L L Reed, May 6, 1896 Reed, May 6, 1896 Parts Sizes Weight m ft gr lbs 1 Frame, including everything of metal,\npermanent and undetachable, such as\nbed-plate, cross-rods for the support of\npropellers, bearing points for clutch, etc 2443\n2 Engine, gears, shafts, etc 1110\n3 Pump, pump shaft\n231\n4 Hull covering\n350\n5 Gasoline tanks, valves\n178\n6 Smokestack\n342\n7 Float\n275\n8 Reel\n77\n9 Wing clamps, 235; clamp for guy-posts,\n29\n264\n10 Other things, counter\n75\n11 Burners\n360\n12 Boilers\n651\n13 Separators, steam gauge, pipe to\nengine\n540\n14 Exhaust pipe\n143\n15\n16\n17 Wings (without clamp)\n1950\n18 Tail (without clamp)\n19 Rudder\n350\n20 Guy sticks, each, 57\n114\n21 Propellers\n800\n22 Extra length of midrod, 308; drop\npiece for rudder, 40\n348\n23 Wood Bowsprit\n74\n24 Other things\n25\n26\n27 Fuel (at starting flight)\n200\n28 Water (at starting flight)\n900\n\n\n29\n30\n31 Sundries unknown\n32\n33\n34 Total flying weight\n11,775\n26\n35\n36\n37\n38 Total area of support (not including\ntail) sq ft 68\n39 Total area of support in feet, divided\nby total flying weight in lbs 2 6\n40 Total area of horizontal tail sq ft 41 Total area of rudder (vertical) sq ft 6\n42 Horse-power at brake Horse-power by\nformula* 72\n7\n43 Minimum pressure during 40 secs lift,\n150 lbs 44 Lift at pendulum (during 40 secs absolute) 5772\n45 Lift at pendulum (during 40 secs in\nterms of wt ) 49%\n46 Minimum pressure with which wheels\nturn, 10 lbs 47 Position of center of pressure of wings†\nF W , 1575; R W , 1383 5\n48 Time of getting up full steam, 1 minute\n49\n50 Curvature of wings, 1/11\n51 Root angle of wings, 9°\n52 Tip angle of wings, 9°\n53 Position of wings, Front rib on F W ,\n1607; R W , 1415 5\n54 How guyed\n55\n56\n57\n58 Position of tail\n59 Angle of tail\n60 Co-efficient elasticity of tail\n61 Position of rudder, center, 1288 3; rear\nend, 1229 8\n62 Line of thrust, 2500\n\n\n63 Line of thrust, 1500 which is 9 cm below the center of midrod\n64 Center of gravity1 of whole, 1497\n65 Center of gravity2 2501, i e , 1 cm above line of thrust\n66 Center of pressure1 of whole estimate,\n1498\n67 Center of pressure2, 2536\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n\n\nParts Remarks 1 Front end of bowsprit, 1686 3 2 Front end of midrod, 1611 6 5 Front edge of F W , 1607 8 C of P on F W , 1575 11 Back edge of F W , 1527 14 Back edge of cross frame, 1509 17 Line through center of propellers, 1500 21 C of G , 1497 24 Front edge of R W , 1415 5 27 C of P on R W , 1383 5 30 End of mid-rod, 1360 5 33 Front end of rudder, 1343 8 36 Back edge of R W , 1335 5 39 Center of rudder, 1288 3 41 Back end of rudder, 1229 8 Footnotes * H P = (Rev × diam × pitch ratio × thrust)/33000\n† This is calculated on the assumption that the center of pressure on each\nwing or on pair of wings at a motion of 2000 feet per minute is in ordinary\ncurved wings 2-5 the way from front to rear, that for wings of usual size\nthe rear wings have 2-3 of the efficiency per surface of the front ones and\nthat the tail proper bears no part of the weight; but if rear wing is smaller\nor larger this efficiency is smaller or larger per unit of surface [p298]\nDATA SHEET No 2 Weight of Aerodrome No 6 Certified to by R L Reed, November 27 and 28, 1896",

ends of pages\nto the ends of the appropriate sections, which are: Advertisement (page\niii); Part I; and Part II, up to just ahead of the Data Sheets—which have\ntheir own footnotes, which were neither moved nor renumbered Illustrations are moved from inside paragraphs to between\nparagraphs The symbol \"lgr\", in a caption to an illustration, links to a\nlarger image—these are available only in the html edition The\ntranscriber created the cover image by editing the title page image, and\nhereby assigns it to the public domain Pages 16–18 Page 16 ended after \"with another one, No 31, also\nshown\" (i e in the middle of a sentence) This was followed by Plates 1–\n4, & then by page 17, which contained two data tables, & then page 18,\nwhich continued the original paragraph The transcriber has closed the\nparagraph, and moved the Plates and tables to follow it Pages 31–32 The footnote on page 31 said only \"See footnote on page\n32 \" The footnote on page 32 had no anchor in the text Therefore, to\nsimplify, the page 31 footnote has been eliminated, and its anchor is\nlinked directly to the page 32 footnote Pages 46–47 The footnote on\npage 47 had no anchor in the text However, the footnote on page 46\nsaid only \"See Footnote page 47\" Therefore, the footnote anchor on page\n46 has been linked directly to the footnote on page 47, eliminating the\npage 46 footnote Page 63 The large table was split into two tables, repeating the first\ncolumn in each part Page 140 The paragraph for June 23 originally ended \"dotted line in\nPlate\" The transcriber has inserted \" 34 \", as a guess",
    "\", as a guess Pages 190–192 The wide tables were split into two, repeating the\nfirst column in each part Page 193 The wide tables were transposed, row for column Page 201 The wide table was split into two Pages 297–308, Data Sheets Remarks originally situated in the tables\nare appended below each Data Sheet Remarks originally situated in the tables\nare appended below each Data Sheet The units of measurement were\noriginally spelled out—m = Metres; ft = Feet; gr = Grammes; and\nlbs = Pounds In the footnotes to the Data Sheets, in the phrases \"curved\nwings 2-5 the way\", and \"rear wings have 2-3 of the efficiency\", the\nhyphen seems to mean division, like \"/\" This usage occurs also in the\ncaption to Plate 85, in \"SCALE 1 1-16 INCH TO STATUTE MILE\" Page 299 Item 41, \"7 75\" changed to \"7 75\" INDEX The original index was structured in a way not suitable for\nthis ebook The white space on the printed page substituted for words\nnot repeated Thus, under \"Balancing of aerodrome, … \", were indented\n\n\nentries for \"engine\", \"wings and rudder\", &c This spacing has been\nrendered herein as a horizontal bar \"—\", one for each word to be\nunderstood as repeated So in this case, two bars, meaning \"Balancing\nof\" Moreover, page numbers referenced by index entries were right-\njustified and preceded by dotted leaders Herein, the leaders have been\nsuggested by horizontal ellipsis \"…\" Herein, the leaders have been\nsuggested by horizontal ellipsis \"…\" Estimating from Internet Archive's stated scanning rate of 400 ppi, the\npages were about 6 2 by 9 2 inches Body text was printed in 9 point\ntype, with 3 point leading, and footnotes were printed in 5 4 point type *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LANGLEY MEMOIR\nON MECHANICAL FLIGHT, PARTS I AND II ***\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed Creating the works from print editions not protected by U",
