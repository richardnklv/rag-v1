    "# Quantum Noise Reduction and Generalized Two-Mode Squeezing in a Cavity Raman Laser\n\n#### Kai Dr¨uhl Claude Windenberger Center for Technology Research Maharishi University of Management Fairfield, IA 52557 Voice: 515-472-1162 Fax: 515-472-1123 E-mail: kdruhl@mum edu August 15, 1998\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe study a generalized notion of two-mode squeezing for the Stokes\nand anti-Stokes fields in a model of a cavity Raman laser, which leads\nto a significant reduction in decoherence or quantum noise The model\ncomprises a loss-less cavity with classical pump, unsaturated medium\nand arbitrary homogeneous broadening and dispersion Allowing for\narbitrary linear combinations of the two modes in the definition of\nquadrature variables, we find that there always exists a combination\nof the two output modes which exhibits quadrature squeezing with\nnoise reduction below the vacuum level The number of noise photons\nfor this combination mode is proportional to the square root of the\nnumber of Stokes noise photons The number of noise photons\nfor this combination mode is proportional to the square root of the\nnumber of Stokes noise photons PACS: 42 50 Dv, 42

quantum noise reduction in a\nmodel of a linear multi-channel quantum amplifier Our investigation deals\nwith both state reduction, or decoherence, and squeezing for the amplified\nchannels In fact, both phenomena turn out to be intimately connected The model describes stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in a loss-less cavity\nwith a single Stokes mode, a single anti-Stokes mode and a classical pump We assume the Raman medium to be not saturated, but allow for arbitrary\nhomogeneous broadening and dispersion The Raman amplification process\ngives rise to both two-mode squeezing and decoherence for the two optical\nfield modes We find that quantum noise resulting from these processes can\nbe largely cancelled by appropriate interference arrangements, while maintaining the full amount of amplification The first arrangement is an ’anti-squeezing’ operation, by which two uncorrelated normal modes are obtained This operation can be implemented,\nfor example, by a linear parametric amplifier If the initial state of fields,\nmedium and reservoir is the vacuum, the state for one of the normal modes is\nthe vacuum, while for the other it is a canonical ensemble of number states The average number of ”noise” photons for the latter mode is equal to the\nnumber of phonons in the medium and reservoir states The second arrangement involves linear mixing of Stokes and anti-Stokes\nwithout additional squeezing The state of the resulting mixed mode is a\ncanonical ensemble of squeezed number states For a suitable, optimal choice\nof mode coefficients, the variance of one of the quadrature phases [1] of\nthe mode is below the vacuum level, in spite of the additional quantum\nnoise resulting from decoherence of the mixed state This result holds for\nall values of dispersion, line width and coupling constants The variance\nof the conjugate quadrature is comparable to the variances of the Stokes\nquadratures For large amplification, the number of squeezed photons in\nthe mixed mode is proportional to the square root of the number of Stokes\nphotons This represents a significant reduction in the amount of decoherence\nfor the mixed mode, as compared to the original modes The use of general mode coefficients amounts to a generalization of the\nnotion of two-mode squeezing For conventional two-mode squeezing, both\nmode coefficients are chosen to be of equal magnitude (This is the definition reported by Loudon and Knight [1] Caves and Schumaker rescale the\n\n\n2\n\n\ncoefficients by frequency dependent factors, to correct for the frequency dependent relationship between photon and field operators [2] ) In this case,\nthe variances of both quadratures and the number of photons of the mixed\nmode grow in proportion to the number of Stokes photons, indicating a much\nhigher level of quantum noise than for the optimal choice of mode coefficients The reduction of quantum noise through squeezing has been studied extensively [1,3] A squeezed state of a harmonic oscillator is a state for which\nthe variance in one of the conjugate variables is reduced at the expense of an\nincrease in the variance of the other variable (We will not discuss the more\ngeneral notions of higher order squeezing which have been defined in terms\nof the variance of polynomials of conjugate variables [4,5] In the context of\nquantum optics it has become customary to speak of conjugate variables as\nquadrature phases [1]) For example, the variance in the electric field of an optical mode may be\nreduced below its vacuum level at the expense of an increased variance in the\nmagnetic field This situation is desirable for high sensitivity interferometer\nexperiments [1,6] and optical communications [1,7] Such squeezed states of\nthe electromagnetic field can be generated by non-linear optical processes,\nsuch as degenerate parametric amplification or four-wave mixing, in which\nphotons are created in pairs If the process is non-degenerate, i e if two\nphotons at different frequencies are generated, squeezing is not found for\neach of the individual modes, but rather for linear combinations of the two This is known as two-mode squeezing, and its experimental detection requires\nan additional coherent source at the sum- or difference frequency [1] Twomode squeezing is conventionally defined in terms of linear combinations with\nequal mode coefficients [1,2] We will show in this paper that, for situations\nwhere decoherence occurs, this is not an optimal definition, and that it is\nuseful to adjust the mode coefficients to compensate for different noise levels\nin the two modes The generation of squeezed light involves an amplification process, and\nthis is frequently associated with state reduction or decoherence State reduction (the transformation of a pure state into a statistical mixture) occurs due to the coupling of the observed modes to a number of unobserved\nor unobservable modes The process of state reduction in linear quantum\namplifiers has been studied for various types of models, and the following\nreferences represent just a small selection of papers which are of interest here\n\n[8,9,10] Such models are of great interest for the description of dissipation in\n\n\n3\n\n\nquantum systems [9,10], and for the analysis of state reduction in quantum\nmeasurement theory [8,10] Most studies refer to harmonic oscillator models\ninvolving a small number of observable variables, and a large or infinite number of unobserved ’reservoir’ oscillators The time evolution of the amplifier\ncan be described either by master equations for the observable degrees of\nfreedom [10], or by exact solutions for the linear equations of motion of the\ncomplete system [8,9,10] The exact solutions reveal that, for these models, the time evolution is\na multi-mode squeezing transformation coupling the observed variables and\nthe reservoir The amount of squeezing in the observable variables depends\non the type of model studied If the coupling to the reservoir involves only\none of the conjugate variables, an initial rapid buildup of decoherence and\nsqueezing for that variable occurs on a very short time-scale, of the order\nof the reservoir coherence time [9,10] In addition, decoherence for both\nconjugate variables increases on a much longer time scale, given by the dissipation rate of the reservoir In quantum optics it is customary to employ the\n‘rotating wave approximation’ (RWA), in which the coupling involves both\nconjugate variables of the observable system in a symmetric fashion In this\napproximation, single-mode squeezing is absent, and decoherence occurs on\nthe longer, dissipative time scale [9,10] The cavity SRS amplifier studied\nhere is in this category So far, studies of quantum amplifiers in the RWA have emphasized either\nthe process of state reduction, or the generation of squeezed states However,\nboth aspects are intimately connected The authors found in [11] that, for\nthe simplest case of a single mode amplifier coupled to an infinite reservoir,\nthe time evolution results in two-mode squeezing for the amplifier mode and\na single, time-dependent reservoir mode If only the amplifier mode is observed, no squeezing is found, and the density matrix contains a large number\nof pure components, proportional to the amplification factor If, on the other\nhand, both the amplifier mode and the large-time limit of the special reservoir mode are observed, the density matrix contains only a small number\nof squeezed pure components Similar results were found for a model of a\nsingle mode laser, comprising a single radiation mode, an inverted medium\nand a reservoir To the best of our knowledge, these connections between the\nchoice of observed mode combinations, the degree of state reduction and the\ndegree of squeezing have not been systematically explored so far The linear cavity Raman amplifier studied here is of particular interest,\n\n\n4\n\n\nboth because of the type of interactions found in this system, and as an\nobject for experimental study The medium is assumed to contain a large\nnumber of unsaturated Raman active molecules or atoms, and is modelled by\na single oscillator mode The coupling between Stokes and medium oscillator\nis of squeezing type However, since the medium is not directly observable,\ntwo-mode variables constructed from these two modes have no experimental significance On the other hand, the coupling between anti-Stokes and\nmedium conserves photon-phonon number, and the anti-Stokes mode can\ntherefore be considered as a probe of the medium In fact, the squeezing\ntransformation occurring between Stokes and medium is reflected in corresponding correlations between Stokes and anti-Stokes While the coupling\nbetween anti-Stokes and medium is in most cases stronger than the Stokes\ncoupling, the influence of the anti-Stokes on the medium is reduced by dispersion, which leads to a frequency detuning of the anti-Stokes It is therefore\nof interest to study the behavior of the CRA over the whole range of relevant\nparameters, including dispersion, homogeneous line width and gain Experimentally, all of these parameters can be controlled independently, by varying\nthe pressure of the gaseous Raman medium, the type of medium and the\npump intensity Cavity SRS models with Stokes and anti-Stokes modes have been studied\nby several authors Non-linear, micro-maser models of SRS in a cavity with a\nsingle three-level atom and without dispersion were studied by Law et al",
    "Non-linear, micro-maser models of SRS in a cavity with a\nsingle three-level atom and without dispersion were studied by Law et al [12]\nand Puri et al [13] [13] The latter found noise reduction below the vacuum level\nwith the conventional notion of two-mode squeezing for certain values of the\nnumber of passes and the passing time of the atom through the cavity Linear\noscillator models of the medium and reservoir had been studied earlier by\nWalls [14] and Perina [15] for arbitrary dispersion and for the limiting case of\nlarge line width, where the medium oscillators are eliminated adiabatically These studies were mainly concerned with photon statistics, and give no\nexplicit discussion of squeezing The first detailed study of squeezing in this\ntype of models was done by Chizhov et al , who studied quadrature and\nhigher order squeezing for the case of zero dispersion in a cavity [16,17] A\nfree-propagation amplifier was studied by Yeong et al [18] In the limit of\nlarge line width [16], quadrature squeezing was reported to be absent, while\nsuch squeezing was found for the case of small line width in [17] and [18] These studies discuss conventional two-mode quadrature squeezing in terms\nof the variance of one of the two-mode quadratures 5\n\n\nOur present work studies the linear cavity SRS model for arbitrary values\nof line width and dispersion (The case of zero dispersion is rather special, in\nthat Stokes, anti-Stokes and the medium undergo damped oscillations For\nnon-zero dispersion, exponential amplification occurs ) Two-mode quadrature squeezing is defined in terms of the ratio of the variances of two conjugate two-mode quadratures, with arbitrary mode coefficients We give\nexplicit expressions for the Wigner characteristic function of the entangled\nstate of Stokes and anti-Stokes modes, and determine those values of the\nmode coefficients, for which maximal squeezing and minimal state-reduction\n\noccur In section 2 1, we give the model equations for the amplitude operators,\nderive the general form of solutions, and calculate the variance of a general\nHermitean combination of the two optical modes for the case where the initial\nstate at time t=0 is the vacuum As is well known, this uniquely determines\nthe Wigner characteristic function, and thereby the Schr¨odinger state at later\ntimes t > 0 In section 2 2, we show that the reduced state of Stokes and\nanti-Stokes is a product of the vacuum and a canonical ensemble of number\nstates for two uncorrelated normal modes These normal modes are obtained\n\nfrom the original optical modes by an ‘anti-squeezing’ transformation, and\nwe show that this transformation can be realized by a linear parametric\namplifier",
    "These normal modes are obtained\n\nfrom the original optical modes by an ‘anti-squeezing’ transformation, and\nwe show that this transformation can be realized by a linear parametric\namplifier In section 2 3, we study ‘non-squeezed’ linear combinations of\nthe two optical modes, and generalize the corresponding notion of two-mode\nsqueezing by admitting arbitrary mode coefficients We show that, at any\ngiven time t, it is possible to choose optimal mode coefficients in such a way,\nthat one of the quadratures has minimal variance below the vacuum level\nat that time This choice also leads to minimal decoherence In situations\nwhere the system shows exponential amplification, the number of photons in\nthe optimal mode is proportional to the square root of the number of Stokes\nphotons, indicating a much higher level of quantum coherence than for the\nStokes mode In section 2 4, we consider amplification of an initial coherent\nstate of the Stokes mode The coherent state is maximally amplified if it is at\n90 degrees relative to the minimal two-mode quadrature, and gives the same\noutput as the vacuum if it is parallel to that quadrature In the former case,\namplitude fluctuations are enhanced, while phase fluctuations are below the\nvacuum level In section 3 1 we give the general solution to the linear equations of motion\nfor optical modes and medium in terms of the eigenvalues of the 3x3 matrix\n\n\n6\n\n\nof coefficients We discuss the special cases of zero and large line width in\nsections 3 2 and 3 3, and the intermediate case of finite line width in section\n3 4",
    "4 In particular, we consider the influence of dispersion on the long-time\nbehavior of the system For zero line width, there exists a critical value of\ndispersion, below which the system shows periodic or quasi-periodic behavior,\nand above which exponential amplification occurs For non-zero line width,\nthe system always shows exponential amplification at large times, except for\nzero dispersion, where the behavior is that of damped oscillations In section 4, we summarize our findings and discuss some possible implications for a deeper understanding of state reduction in more general systems ### 2 Model equations, state reduction and squeez- ing\n\n#### 2 1 Model equations and characteristic functions\n\n\nOur model of a cavity Raman laser contains the following variables: a classical pump at frequency ω 0, a Raman-active medium with transition frequency\nω 3, a reservoir of oscillators with frequencies ω r, r = 4 N, modelling homogeneous broadening of the Raman transition, a Stokes mode at frequency\nω 1 = ω 0 − ω 3, and an anti-Stokes mode at frequency ω 2 = ω 0 + ω 3 + ∆ The\nparameter ∆is a frequency detuning of the anti-Stokes mode which results\nfrom dispersion in the Raman-active medium Figure 1 shows a level diagram\nof the medium, including the Raman transition, two transient intermediate\nstates and the three optical frequencies ω 0, ω 1, and ω 2 The medium is assumed to be only weakly excited, with most of its population in the ground state It can therefore be modelled by a single harmonic\noscillator We write the Heisenberg operators [˜] b n (t), n = 1 N for all variables involved as products of time-dependent phase factors and amplitude\noperators b n (t):\n\n\n˜\nb 1 (t) = e [−][i][(][ω] [0] [−][ω] [3] [)][t] b 1 (t),\n\n˜\nb 2 (t) = e [−][i][(][ω] [0] [+][ω] [3] [)][t] b 2 (t),\n\n˜\nb k (t) = e [−][iω] [k] [t] b k (t) (k = 3, , N ) The Heisenberg equations of motion for the amplitude operators in the\n\n\n7\n\n\nMarkov approximation are [16,17]:\n\n\n˙\nb [†] 1 = κ 1 b 3, (1)\n\n˙\nb 2 = −i∆b 2 − κ 2 b 3, (2)\n\n\n\n˙\nb 3 = κ 1 b [†] 1 [+][ κ] [2] [b] [2] [−] [Γ][b] [3] [+][ F,] F =\n\n\n\nN\n� g s e [−][i][∆] [s] [t] b s (0), (3)\n\ns=4\n\n\n\n˙\nb r = −g r e [i][∆] [r] [t] b 3 (r = 4 N ), (4)\n\n\nwhere κ 1, κ 2 and g r are the coupling coefficients for the medium with the\nStokes, anti-Stokes and reservoir variables The frequency detunings are\n∆= ω 2 − ω 3 − ω 0 and ∆ r = ω r − ω 3 The solutions of these equations take\nthe form:\n\n\n\nb [†] 1 [(][t][)] = T 11 (t)a [†] 1 [+]\n\n\nb i (t) = T i1 (t)a [†] 1 [+]\n\n\n\nN\n� T 1k (t)a k,\n\nk=2\n\n\nN\n� T ik (t)a k (i = 2 N ), (5)\n\nk=2\n\n\n\nwhere a n = b n (0), n = 1 N, and the coefficients T nm (t) are c-number\nsolutions of equations (1) through (4) which satisfy:\n\n\nT nm (0) = 1;

normal modes, which are\n\n\n20\n\n\nobtained from the Stokes and anti-Stokes modes by an anti-squeezing transformation Second, there exist optimal linear combination modes, for which\nthe variance of one quadrature is always below the vacuum value The states\nof such optimal modes are canonical ensembles of coherent squeezed number\nstates, and the average number of noise photons is proportional to the square\nroot of the number of Stokes noise photons Thus, the degree of decoherence\nfor the combination mode is much less than for the individual Stokes and\n\nanti-Stokes modes The reduction of variance in the minimal quadrature of the optimal combination mode can be understood as resulting from a cancellation of anticorrelated quantum noise in the individual modes To optimize the amount\nof cancellation, the mode coefficients have to be chosen appropriately, and\nwill in general not be of equal magnitude This corresponds to a generalization of the conventional notion of two-mode squeezing If a coherent state is used as input to the Stokes channel of the amplifier,\nthe corresponding field amplitude will be cancelled in the combination mode,\nif it has the same phase as the minimal quadrature, and will be optimally\namplified if its phase differs by ±90 degrees The optimally amplified signal\nis thus phase-squeezed These results may be of interest for the generation of squeezed light\nthrough stimulated Raman scattering They also provide clear experimental signatures for the experimental observation of anti-correlation between\nStokes and anti-Stokes It is of particular interest, that these signatures are\nfound for all values of the experimentally relevant parameters, such as pump\namplitude, dispersion and line widths Previous work on quadrature squeezing in this model had been restricted to a limited range of parameters (small\nlinewidth, zero dispersion) With the recent demonstration of a cw-Raman laser by J K Brasseur et\nal [19], experiments to verify our predictions may become feasible in the\nnear future ### Acknowledgments\n\n\nIt is our pleasure to acknowledge receipt of a preprint ”Continuous wave\nRaman laser in H 2 ”

[≫] [Γ][, κ] [2] i [,] and were used to verify the\ncorrectness of the numerical procedure The calculations are straightforward\nand will not be detailed here 23\n\n\n### References\n\n\n[1] R Loudon

transition at frequencies ω = 0 and ω = ω 3, and two intermediate levels at frequencies ω = ω 0\nand ω = ω 0 + ω 3 for Stokes and anti-Stokes generation The corresponding\nabsorption of pump radiation and generation of Stokes and anti-Stokes is\nindicated by vertical and horizontal arrows The anti-Stokes mode at frequency ω = ω 0 + ω 3 + ∆and its driving polarization at ω = ω 0 + ω 3 are\nrepresented by two different lines, separated by the frequency detuning ∆ Figure 2 illustrates the sequence of entangling and dis-entangling operations\nperformed by the cavity Raman laser (CRL) and linear parametric amplifier\n(LPA) The uncorrelated states of the initial Stokes and anti-Stokes modes a 1\nand a 2, and of the final normal modes c 1 and c 2, are represented by disjoint\ncircles, while the entangled state of the intermediate, amplified Stokes and\nanti-Stokes modes b 1 and b 2 is represented by a single ellipse The quantities\nn 1 and n 2 are the corresponding photon numbers Figure 3 illustrates the effect of amplification on the coherent states of the\nnear-optimal combination mode b The coherent states are represented by\nellipses in the complex ν plane, which are centered at the coherent displacement parameter ν = ν 1 for the initial states and ν = δ for the final states The axes of the ellipses are proportional to the root of the variances of the\ncorresponding quadratures The arrows connect the initial state to the final\nstate resulting from amplification Case (a) represents the vacuum going to a\nsqueezed state Cases (b), (c) and (d) represent various initial coherent states\nwith imaginary, real and complex δ going the corresponding final states, with\n(b) going to the same state as (a), and (c) going to the same state as (d) Figures 4 a to 4 d Shown are the variances of the minimal quadrature variable for the choice of conventional, fixed and minimizing mode coefficients\n(ϕ [2] conv [,][ ϕ] [2] fix [and][ ϕ]
