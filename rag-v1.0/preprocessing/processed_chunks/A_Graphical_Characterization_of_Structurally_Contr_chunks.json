    "## A Graphical Characterization of Structurally Controllable Linear Systems with Dependent Parameters\n\nF Liu and A S S Morse\n\n\n\nAbstract—One version of the concept of structural controllability defined for single-input systems by Lin and subsequently\ngeneralized to multi-input systems by others, states that a parameterized matrix pair (A, B) whose nonzero entries are distinct\nparameters, is structurally controllable if values can be assigned\nto the parameters which cause the resulting matrix pair to be\ncontrollable In this paper the concept of structural controllability\nis broadened to allow for the possibility that a parameter may\nappear in more than one location in the pair (A, B) Subject to\na certain condition on the parameterization called the “binary\nassumption”, an explicit graph-theoretic characterization of such\nmatrix pairs is derived Index Terms—Linear time-invariant systems, structural controllability, graph theory I I I NTRODUCTION\n\n\nOver the past few years there has been a resurgence of\ninterest in the question of structural controllability posed by\nLin in 1974 [2], which aims to capture the controllability of\nsystems with parameters whose values are not exactly known\nbut only approximately determined As defined by Lin, a pair\nof matrices (A n×n, b n×1 ) with each entry either a fixed zero\nor a distinct scalar parameter is structurally controllable if\nthere is a real matrix pair ( A [¯] n×n, [¯] b n×1 ) with the same pattern\nof zero entries as (A, b) which is controllable Thus if (A, b)\nis structurally controllable, then almost every real matrix pair\n( A, [¯] [¯] b) with the same pattern of zero entries as (A, b) will be\ncontrollable Lin was able to give an explicit graph-theoretic\ncondition for such a matrix pair to be structurally controllable\nin terms of properties of a suitably defined directed graph\ndetermined by the given matrix pair Lin’s result was extended\nto multi-input matrix pairs (A n×n, B n×m ) in linear algebra\nterms by Shields and Pearson [3] and reexplained in graph\ntheory terms by Mayeda [4] Generic properties and design\nproblems of Lin’s parameterization of the pair (A, B) were\nstudied in [5]–[12] Results on structural controllability of\nlinear time-varying systems were presented in [13]–[21] One\nline of research deals with the structural controllability of\ncomposite systems [22]–[26] Current interest stems from the\nrealization that structural controllability is a key property of\ninterest in swarming behavior and in the modeling and understanding complex networks [27]–[35] For example, identification, characterization, and classification of driver vertices or\nsteering vertices in biomedical networks [36]–[43], which tend\n\n\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation grant n 1607101",

    "Therefore all minors of [A B] are multilinear functions\nof the q parameters The statement in other direction can be\neasily proved by its contrapositive The statement in other direction can be\neasily proved by its contrapositive In the sequel it will be convenient to use the n × (n + m)\npartitioned matrix [A(p) B(p)] In view of (2), this matrix can\nbe expressed as\n\n\n[A(p) B(p)] = � g k p k h k (4)\n\nk∈q\n\n\nwhere h k ≜ [h k1 h k2 ] for k ∈ q It will be assumed for simplicity and without loss of generality that the set of matrices\n{g 1 h 1, g 2 h 2, , g q h q } is linearly independent To justify this\nassumption, suppose that the set is not linearly independent\nand for purposes of illustration that g q h q is a linear combination of the remaining matrices g 1 h 1, g 2 h 2, , g (q−1) h (q−1) In other words, suppose that\n\n\n\nwhere p ∈ IR [q] is a vector of q > 0 algebraically independent\nparameters p 1, p 2, , p q, q ≜ {1, 2, , q}, and for each\nk ∈ q, g k ∈ IR [n], h k1 ∈ IR [1][×][n], h k2 ∈ IR [1][×][m] In this context,\nthe problem of interest is to find conditions for the existence\nof a parameter vector p ∈ IR [q] for which (A(p), B(p)) is a\ncontrollable matrix pair If such values exist, the parameterized\npair (A(p), B(p)) is structurally controllable Such pairs are\ncontrollable for almost every value of p in the sense that the\nset of values of p for which (A, B) is controllable is the\ncomplement of a proper algebraic set in IR [q] Necessary and sufficient conditions for such a matrix pair\nto be structurally controllable in this more generalized sense\nare developed in [52] Like the work of Shields and Pearson\n\n[3], these conditions are primarily matrix-algebraic A special\nform of linearly parameterized matrix pairs can be used to\nmodel compartmental systems and corresponds to compartmental graphs, on which graphical conditions for the structural\ncontrollability of matrix pairs in this special form have been\ninvestigated [53] Other types of parameterization have also\nbeen explored, but either purely algebraically [54], [55], or\nwithout equivalent graphical conditions [57] Since graphical\nresults can reveal important structural properties hidden in matrix representations, there is interest in determining graphical\nconditions characterizing the generalized concept of structural\ncontrollability and this is the specific problem which this paper\nis addressed Before proceeding we point out that not every matrix pair\n(A, B) with parameters entering “linearly” is a linear parameterization as defined here For example, while the matrix pair\nshown in (1) is linearly parameterized, the matrix pair\n\n\n\ng q h q =\n\n\n\nq−1\n� c k g k h k\n\n\nk=1\n\n\n\nwhere the c k are real numbers Then in view of (4),\n\n\n\n\n[A(p) B(p)] =\n\n\n\nq−1\n� g k (p k + c k p q )h k\n\n\nk=1\n\n\n\nTherefore if we define new parameters ¯p k = p k + c k p q for\nk ∈{1, 2, , q − 1}, then the right side of (4) can be written\nusing only the first q − 1 matrices in {g 1 h 1, g 2 h 2, , g q h q }\n\nas\nq−1\n� g k ¯p k h k\n\n\nk=1\n\n\nIt is clear from this that the process of defining\nnew parameters and eliminating dependent matrices from\n{g 1 h 1, g 2 h 2, , g q h q } can be continued until one has a\nlinearly independent subset of matrices This justifies our\nclaim and accordingly it will henceforth be assumed that\n{g 1 h 1, g 2 h 2, , g q h q } is a linearly independent set This\nimplies that q ≤ n(n + m) Since this paper deals with matrix pairs parameterized by\np exclusively, it is convenient to drop p in A(p) and B(p),\ni e , to write A and B instead of A(p) and B(p), with the\nunderstanding that (A, B) is parameterized by p B Graph of (A, B)\n\n\nIt is easy to see that the definition of structural controllability for a linearly parameterized matrix pair (A, B) coincides\nwith Lin’s if m = 1 and the g k and h k are restricted to be\nunit vectors in IR [n] and IR [1][×][(][n][+1)] respectively Lin defines the\ngraph of such a matrix pair to be an unweighted directed graph\n\n\n\np 1 p 1\nA = � 0 p 1\n\n\n\n0\n, b = (3)\n� �p 2 �\n\n\n\nis not It is claimed that a matrix pair (A, B) whose entries\ndepend linearly on q parameters p 1, p 2, , p q will be linearly\nparameterized if and only if all minors of the partitioned matrix\n\n[A B] are multilinear functions of the q parameters It is clear\nthat the matrices in (3) do not have this property To see why\nthe claim is true, let (A, B) be a linearly parameterized matrix\n\n\n1 Although written differently, this linear parameterization is in fact the same\nas the one considered in [52] except that in [52] there are constant matrices\nA 0 and B 0 also appearing in the sums in (2) for A(p) and B(p) respectively on n + 1 vertices labeled 1 to n + 1 with an arc from vertex j\nto vertex i if the ijth entry in the matrix [A B] is a parameter For the more general linear parameterization defined by (4), a\nmore elaborate definition of a graph is needed not just because\nm might be greater than 1, but also because some parameter\np k may appear in multiple locations in [A B] The graph of (A, B), written G, is defined to be an\nunweighted directed graph with n + m vertices labeled 1\nthrough n + m and an arc of color [2] k from vertex j to vertex\ni if the ijth entry in the matrix g k h k is nonzero, i e , the\nijth entry in the partitioned matrix [A B] contains p k In the\nsequel, (j, i) k denotes an arc from vertex j to vertex i with\ncolor k This graph has q colors Figure 2 shows the graph of\n\n\n0 0 0 p 1 0 p 1\n\n   \n\n\n\ng k and h k appearing in (4) are unit vectors So any linear parameterization satisfying the unitary assumption also satisfies\nthe binary assumption Lin’s parameterization is exactly the\nlinear parameterization satisfying the unitary assumption It is quite clear that when the binary assumption holds with\nn and m specified, the parameterization in (4) is uniquely\ndetermined by a structural controllability graph Because of\nthis, it is possible to characterize the structural controllability\nof a linearly parameterized matrix pair (A, B) which satisfies\nthe binary assumption, solely in terms of the graph of the pair On the other hand, without the binary assumption, no such\ngraphical characterization [3] is possible The following example\nillustrates this Note that although the matrix pairs\n\n\np 1 p 1 p 2 0 p 1 p 1 p 2 0\n\n       \n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np 1 p 1 p

    "D Problem Formulation and Organization\n\n\nThis paper gives necessary and sufficient graph-theoretic\nconditions for the structural controllability of a linearly parameterized matrix pair (A n×n, B n×m ) which satisfies the binary\nassumption To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ngraph-theoretic result that generalizes the conditions given in\n\n[2] and [4] The rest of the paper is organized as follows The terminology and concepts used in this paper are defined\nin Section II The main result of this paper is presented in\nSection III and proved in Section IV II P RELIMINARIES\n\n\nIn order to state the main result of this paper, some\nterminology and a number of graphical and algebraic concepts\nare needed A Terminology\n\n\nLet H be an unweighted directed graph with a vertex set\nV and an arc set A An induced subgraph of H by a subset\nof vertices U ⊂V is a subgraph of H, whose vertex set is\nU and whose arc set is {(i, j) | i, j ∈U, (i, j) ∈A} For\nany subset U ⊂V, V −U is the complement of U in V A\nsource vertex in H is a vertex with no incoming arc and a\nsink vertex in H is a vertex with no outgoing arc An isolated\nvertex is both a source vertex and a sink vertex A partition π\nof V is a family of nonempty subsets of V which are pairwise\ndisjoint and whose union is equal to V The quotient graph\nof H induced by π, written H/π, is an unweighted directed\ngraph with one vertex for each cell of π, and exactly one arc\nfrom vertex i to vertex j whenever H has at least one arc from\n\n\n3 If the binary assumption is dropped, one way to proceed is to define the\ngraph of (A, B) as a weighted directed graph, in which the weight of an\narc (j, i) k is the ijth entry in the matrix g k h k The conditions on weighted\ngraphs for the structural controllability of all linearly parameterized matrix\npairs will be studied in a sequel of this paper p 1 p 1 p 2\n\np 1 p 1 p 2\n0 0 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 0 0 p 1\np 5 0 0 0\n0

arc pointing toward any of the m vertices with labels\nn + 1 to n + m, since the matrix [A B] only has n rows (ii) There may be more than one arc from one given vertex\nj to another vertex i, for the ijth entry in the matrix [A B]\nmay be a linear combination of more than one parameter If\nthis is the case, all arcs from vertex j to vertex i will have\ndistinct colors (iii) If there are two arcs of color k ∈ q, one\nleaving vertex j and the other pointing toward vertex i, then\nthere must be an arc (j, i) k This is because the two given arcs\nimply that the jth entry in the row vector h k and the ith entry\nin the column vector g k are nonzero, which means the ijth\nentry in the matrix g k h k is nonzero Any unweighted directed\ngraph on n + m vertices which has these properties is called\na structural controllability graph C Binary Assumption\n\n\nThis paper focuses exclusively on linear parameterizations\nwhich satisfy a certain “binary assumption” Specifically, the\nlinear parameterization defined by (4) satisfies the binary\nassumption if all of the g k and h k appearing in (4) are\nbinary vectors, i e , vectors of 1’s and 0’s Similarly, a linear\nparameterization satisfies the unitary assumption if all of the\n\n\n2 In this paper, each color is labeled by a distinct integer

vertices in the ith cell to the vertices in the jth cell H/π\nis the condensation of H if π is formed by the collection of\nstrongly connected components of H A directed path graph is a weakly connected [58] graph\nwhose vertices can be labeled in the order 1 to k for some k ∈\nIN such that the arcs are (i, i + 1), where i = 1, 2, , k − 1 The length of a directed path graph is the number of arcs\nin it So in a directed path graph of positive length, the first\nvertex has exactly one outgoing arc, the last vertex has exactly\none incoming arc, and each of the other vertices in between\nhas exactly one incoming arc and one outgoing arc In this\ncontext, a directed path graph of length 0 is an isolated vertex A directed cycle graph is a strongly connected [58] graph\nwhose vertices can be labeled in the order 1 to k for some\nk ∈ IN such that the arcs are (i, i + 1) and (k, 1), where\ni = 1, 2, , k − 1 So in a directed cycle graph, each vertex\nhas exactly one incoming arc and one outgoing arc One vertex\nwith a single self-loop is also a directed cycle graph As this\npaper is concerned with directed graphs only, a directed path\ngraph and a directed cycle graph will be simply called a path\ngraph and a cycle graph, respectively, in the rest of the paper The disjoint union of two or more graphs is the union of\nthese graphs whose vertex sets are disjoint A directed graph\nis rooted if it contains at least one vertex r called a root with\n\nthe property that for each remaining vertex v there is a directed\npath from r to v Rooted directed graphs arise naturally in the\nstudy of consensus problems [59] A directed rooted tree is a\nrooted directed graph which is also a weakly connected tree\n\n[58] H has a spanning forest if it has a spanning subgraph\n\n[58] which is the disjoint union of directed rooted trees Let\nV root ⊂V be the set of root vertices of the trees With a slight\nabuse of terminology, we will say that H has a spanning forest\nrooted at the vertices in V root if and only if for each vertex\nv ∈V −V root, there is a path to v from one of the root vertices B Graphical Concepts\n\n\nA multi-colored subgraph of a structural controllability\ngraph G is a spanning subgraph of G, which is the disjoint\nunion of m path graphs and any number of cycle graphs with\neach arc in the union graph of a different color Clearly, a\nmulti-colored subgraph of G has n arcs that do not share\n\n\n\ncolors, start vertices, or end vertices Figure 3 shows three\nmulti-colored subgraphs of the graph in Figure 2 A multi-colored subgraph S of a structural controllability\ngraph G is obtained by sequentially removing arcs from G as\nfollows First pick any arc (a, b) k 1 in G and then remove any\nother arcs with the same color k 1 as well as any arcs other\nthan (a, b) k 1 pointing toward vertex b and/or leaving vertex a Next, from the set of arcs which remain after these removals,\npick any arc (c, d) k 2 and repeat the process until no further\narc picking is possible If a total of n arcs are left, the graph\nwhich remains is S Clearly, S is not unique In the sequel,\nR(G) denotes the set of all multi-colored subgraphs of G Suppose G is the graph of a linearly parameterized matrix\npair (A, B) It is possible that G does not have any multicolored subgraph, that is, R(G) is an empty set As the n\narcs in a multi-colored subgraph have n distinct colors, n\ndifferent start vertices and n different end vertices, R(G) = ∅\nif and only if there are no n distinct parameters appearing in\nn different rows and n different columns of the partitioned\nmatrix [A B] If so, rank [A B] < n for any p ∈ IR [q], as\neach parameter enters [A B] in a rank-one fashion Then the\npair (A, B) is not structurally controllable The source vertices (respectively, sink vertices) of a multicolored subgraph S are the m source vertices (respectively,\nsink vertices) of the path graphs in S It is not hard to see that\nthe source vertices of every multi-colored subgraph of G are\nthe m vertices with labels n + 1 to n + m, since there is no\narc pointing toward any of them But the sink vertices of a\nmulti-colored subgraph may be any m vertices in G Two multi-colored subgraphs S 1, S 2 ∈R(G) are called\nsimilar if S 1 and S 2 have the same m sink vertices and\nthe same set of n colors Graph similarity is an equivalence\nrelation on R(G) The corresponding equivalence classes\ninduced by this relation are called similarity classes As an example of this concept, let G be the graph in Figure 2 Let E 1 be the similarity class of multi-colored subgraphs\nwith sink vertices 1 and 2, and colors 1, 2, 3, 4 Figure 3a\nand Figure 3b show the two multi-colored subgraphs in E 1 Figure 3c shows a multi-colored subgraph in the similarity\nclass E 2 with sink vertices 2 and 6, and colors 1, 3, 4, 5 In\nfact, this graph is the only multi-colored subgraph of G in E 2

Fig 4\n\n\n\nSpecific quotient graphs of the multi-colored subgraphs in\nthe same similarity class will be used to define an important\nproperty of the class Let V be the vertex set of a structural\ncontrollability graph G For any subset U ⊂V, let |U| be\nthe number of elements in U Let V source ⊂V be the set of\nm source vertices of every multi-colored subgraph of G Let\nV sink ⊂V be the set of m sink vertices of a given multicolored subgraph S of G So V source ∩V sink is the set of isolated\nvertices in S and |V source − (V source ∩V sink )| = |V sink − (V source ∩\nV sink )| ≤ m The desired quotient graph of S is induced by a\n“matrimonial partition” A partition π of V is a matrimonial\npartition for S if it pairs each vertex in V source − (V source ∩\nV sink ) with a different vertex in V sink − (V source ∩V sink ) and\nassigns each pair to a different cell, then assigns each of the\nrest vertices in V to a new cell So there are |V| −|V source −\n(V source ∩V sink )| cells in π and each of them has at most two\nvertices If the pairing is not unique, π is not unique An observation made by comparing S and the quotient graph\nS/π is that the cycle graphs and isolated vertices in S remain\nthe same in S/π, while the path graphs with positive lengths in\nS are, roughly speaking, “welded” together to form new cycle\ngraphs in S/π In the sequel, it is assumed that the quotient\ngraphs of all multi-colored subgraphs in one similarity class\nare induced by the same matrimonial partition For example, π = {{1, 5}, {2, 6}, {3}, {4}} is a matrimonial partition for the two multi-colored subgraphs in Figure 3a\nand Figure 3b The quotient graphs of the two graphs induced\nby π are shown in Figure 4a and Figure 4b, respectively A multi-colored subgraph is odd (respectively, even) if its\nquotient graph induced by a matrimonial partition has an odd\n(respectively, even) number of cycle graphs As will be stated\nin Lemma 4, the choice of the matrimonial partition does not\naffect the relative parity of two multi-colored subgraphs in\nthe same similarity class as long as their quotient graphs are\ninduced by the same partition, where parity is the property\nof being odd or even A similarity class of multi-colored\nsubgraphs is balanced if the numbers of odd and even multicolored subgraphs in the similarity class are equal Otherwise,\nit is unbalanced This important property of a similarity class\nis regardless of which matrimonial partition is chosen From Figure 4, one knows that the graph in Figure 3a is\nodd and the graph in Figure 3b is even, so the similarity class\nE 1 is balanced The similarity class E 2 is unbalanced as it only\nhas one multi-colored subgraph A “cactus graph” introduced by Lin is a weakly connected\ngraph consisting of one “trunk” and any number of “buds” A\ntrunk is a path graph with at least one vertex A bud consists of\n\n\n\none cycle graph with at least one vertex and one additional arc\ncalled the bud’s stem which is incident to one of the cycle’s\nvertices A cactus graph is then a weakly connected graph\nwith exactly one trunk and any non-negative number of buds\nwith the understanding that the stem of each bud comes out of\neither a vertex on the trunk or a vertex on the cycle of another\nbud in the graph In this context a path graph is a cactus graph\nwith no bud Some definition of a cactus graph requires that\nthe stem of a bud cannot come out of the last vertex on the\n\ntrunk, but the definition in this paper does not, because it does\nnot matter The graphical condition involving cactus graphs is\nalways that the original graph has a spanning subgraph which\nis a cactus graph or a disjoint union of cactus graphs If the\noriginal graph has a spanning subgraph that is a cactus graph\nwith one bud whose stem comes out of the last vertex on the\n\ntrunk, the original graph must also have a spanning subgraph\nthat is a cactus graph with no bud, obtained by removing

    ", a maximum-cardinality\nset of arcs that do not share vertices, in the sense that a\nnonstandard matching allows the start vertex of an arc to be\nthe end vertex of another arc, but a standard

spanning subgraph which is\na disjoint union of m path graphs and any number of cycle\ngraphs (iii) The graph of (A, B) has a nonstandard maximum matching of size n The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is given by Lemma 2 in [4] The equivalence of (i) and (iii) is established as follows It\nis possible to represent the graph G of (A, B) by a bipartite\ngraph B such that each vertex i of G becomes two vertices\ni [+] and i [−] in B and each arc (j, i) of G corresponds to an arc\n(j [+], i [−] ) in B Lemma 1 in [60] implies that grk [A B] = n\nif and only if B has a standard maximum matching of

Then L(G)/π and T [�] are isomorphic with the bijection that\nmaps vertex u i in L(G)/π to vertex w i in T [�] If (A, B) is irreducible, by Proposition 1, G has a spanning\nforest rooted at the m

of U Let V root ⊂V 0 be the\nset of source vertices of the m path graphs in U For each\ni ∈ c ≜ {1, 2, , c}, let V i ⊂V be the set of vertices in the\nith cycle graph of U So\n\n\n\nV =\n\n\n\nc\n� V i\n\n\ni=0\n\n\n\nand\nV i ∩V j = ∅, i ̸= j, i, j ∈{0, 1, , c}\n\n\nSince G has a spanning forest rooted at the m vertices in V root,\nthere exists an arc in G from a vertex in V 0 to a vertex in V i 1\nfor some i 1 ∈ c Otherwise, there is no path to the vertices in\nV −V 0 from any root vertex Let V 0 [1] [≜] [V] [0] [ ∪V] [i] 1 [ Similarly,]\nthere exists another arc in G from a vertex in V 0 [1] [to a vertex]\nin V i 2 for some i 2 ∈ c −{i 1 }, otherwise there is no path\nto the vertices in V −V 0 [1] [from any root vertex The process]\ncontinues until one finds c arcs in G that connect V 0, V 1, ,\nV c The addition of the c arcs to U renders a disjoint union of\nm cactus graphs rooted at the m vertices in V root Proof of Theorem 1, (iii) ⇐⇒ (iv): Obviously, (iii) =⇒ (iv) If the graph G of (A, B) has an unbalanced similarity class\nof multi-colored subgraphs, G has at least one multi-colored\nsubgraph So a spanning subgraph of G is the disjoint union\nof m path graphs and a non-negative number of cycle graphs,\nwhere the source vertices are the m vertices with labels n + 1\nto n+m By Lemma 6, (iv) =⇒ (iii) Therefore, (iii) ⇐⇒ (iv) V",
    "V C ONCLUSION\n\nThis paper extends the graph-theoretic conditions for structural controllability to the class of linearly parameterized\nmatrix pairs satisfying the binary assumption As a byproduct\nof the analysis, Corollary 1 presents a tighter upper bound on\nthe rank of a matrix product than the minimum rank of the\nmatrices in the product If one wants to further extend the\ngraph-theoretic conditions to all linearly parameterized matrix\npairs, weighted graphs of matrix pairs must be introduced To accommodate this, some graphical concepts will have\nto be modified accordingly, such as quotient graph, multicolored subgraph, balanced or unbalanced similarity class of\n\n\n\nmulti-colored subgraphs, and line graph Some future research\nproblems are: (1) to show that it is NP-hard to determine\nwhether the graph of (A, B) has an unbalanced similarity class\nof multi-colored subgraphs; (2) to find the minimum number\nof input required for the structural controllability of a given\nlinearly parameterized matrix A n×n ; (3) to study the structural\ncontrollability of linearly parameterized linear time-varying\nsystems; (4) to eventually generalize the definition and the\ncorresponding characterizations of structural controllability to\nnonlinear systems for which there is a good understanding of\ncontrollability R EFERENCES\n\n\n[1] F Liu and A S Morse, “Structural controllability of linear systems,”\nin Proc IEEE Conf Decision Control, Melbourne, Australia, 2017, pp 3588–3593 [2] C -T Lin, “Structural controllability,” IEEE Trans Autom Control,\nvol 19, no 3, pp 201–208, 1974 [3] R W Shields and J B B Pearson, “Structural controllability of multi-input\nlinear systems,” Rice University ECE Technical Report, no TR7502,\n1975 [4] H Mayeda, “On structural controllability theorem,” IEEE Trans Autom Control, vol 26, no 3, pp 795–798, 1981 [5] C -T Lin, “System structure and minimal structure controllability,” IEEE\nTrans Autom Control, vol 22, no 5, pp 855–862, 1977 [6] S Hosoe, “Determination of generic dimensions of controllable subspaces and its application,” IEEE Trans",
