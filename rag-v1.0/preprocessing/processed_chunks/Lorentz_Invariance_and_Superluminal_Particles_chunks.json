    "[5, 6]) If the critical speed in vacuum is not an absolute expression of any intrinsic geometry\nof space-time, but depends (like the space-time geometry felt by the particle) on the deep\ndynamical properties of the matter under consideration, the fact that several particles\nhave with great precision the same high-energy speed (i If the critical speed in vacuum is not an absolute expression of any intrinsic geometry\nof space-time, but depends (like the space-time geometry felt by the particle) on the deep\ndynamical properties of the matter under consideration, the fact that several particles\nhave with great precision the same high-energy speed (i e the high p limit of ∇ ⃗p E,\nwhere ⃗p stands for momentum, E for energy and p is the modulus of ⃗p) in vacuum is by\nitself the signature of a fundamental symmetry of this sector of matter (like preonic grand\nunification or extended supersymmetry) If, in the vacuum rest frame, free particles obey\nequations of the type:\n\n\n− A ∂ [2] φ/∂t [2] + iB ∂φ/∂t + Σ [3] j=1 [∂] [2] [φ/∂x] [2] j − D φ = 0 (1)\n\n\nwhere A, B and D are sectorial parameters and may be different for different particles,\nthe possible universality of the critical speed inside a dynamical sector reflects an exact\nsectorial symmetry of the parameter A The non-universality of mass inside the sector\ncorresponds to a symmetry breaking effect acting on the parameter D This would be\nperfectly compatible, for instance, with standard scenarios of supersymmetry breaking\nwhere the spontaneous breaking is a low-energy effect and leaves physics unchanged in\nthe high-energy region above the symmetry-breaking scale Thus, the apparent intrinsic\nproperties of space and time, as felt by ordinary matter (experiment indicates that B\nis small), would just reflect the fact that the sectorial universality of A (giving the highenergy speed of particles) is preserved to a very good approximation by symmetry-breaking\nphenomena The exact universality of the high-energy speed would not by itself imply exact\nsectorial Lorentz invariance: B ̸= 0 violates such an invariance, but as will be seen later\nfinite-energy effects or new Lorentz-violating terms can also arise In what follows, we\nassume for simplicity that the parameter B vanishes or can be neglected",
    "In what follows, we\nassume for simplicity that the parameter B vanishes or can be neglected 2\n\n\n2 LORENTZ SYMMETRY VIOLATION\n\n\nAssume that: a) each sector has a conserved sectorial symmetry broken only spontaneoulsy by a low-energy phenomenon (like standard breaking of GUTs or supersymmetry);\nb) all particles (or, at least, all basic constituents) belong to a single multiplet of the symmetry If the interaction between two different sectors (the ordinary sector and a superluminal one) preserves both sectorial symmetries (but breaks the two Lorentz invariances),\nseveral possible mechanisms can be considered which we describe in a simplified way:\n\n\n2a Intrinsic violations\n\n\nA typical example is provided by terms due to a possible phase transition at very high\nenergy (see, e g [2, 5]) above which Lorentz invariance, and even possibly the particles\nunder consideration, do no longer exist If k i is the critical wave vector scale of the i-th\nsuperluminal sector [2], such terms can be represented by powers of k i [−][2] Σ [3] j=1 [∂] [2] [/∂x] [2] j [times]\nthe usual laplacian For the ordinary particles, k i is to be replaced by k 0, where k 0 is the\ncritical wave vector scale of the ordinary sector To lowest order, in the i-th superluminal\nsector, we can add to (1) a term αk i [−][2] (Σ [3] j=1 [∂] [2] [/∂x] [2] j [)] [2] [ φ][, and similarly for the ordinary]\nsector with k 0 instead of k i The sectorial parameter α is expected to be of order 1 In\nterms of wave function parameters, we can write in the vacuum rest frame from (1):\n\n\nE = (2π) [−][1] h A [−][1][/][2] (k [2] + D) [1][/][2] (2)\n\n\nwhere E is the energy, [⃗] k the wave vector and we have taken B = 0 in (1) The inclusion\nof the new term would replace in (2) k [2] by k [2] (1 + αk [2] k i [−][2] [) if the sector is superluminal,]\nand by k [2] (1 + αk [2] k 0 [−][2] [) if we are considering the ordinary sector More generally, we can]\nreplace in (1) k [2] by k [2] f (κ) where κ = k [2] k i [−][2] if we are dealing with a superluminal sector\nand κ = k [2] k 0 [−][2] in the ordinary sector We take f (0) = 1 and expect f (κ) to exhibit a\nsingularity in the region κ ≈ 1 indicating the dissappearence of the Lorentz regime and the\ntransition to new expressions of fundamental vacuum dynamics If the sectorial symmetry\nis preserved at high energy, we expect the function f (κ) to be universal inside each sector\nand not to generate any difference in critical speed between particles of the same sector Terms involving higher t derivatives can be dealt with in a similar way If the sectorial symmetry remains unbroken at high energy and the value of A remains\nuniversal inside the sector under consideration, we do not expect obvious measurable effects\nfrom conventional tests of Lorentz invariance Contrary to the scenario recently considered\nby Coleman and Glashow [8], the existence of very high-energy cosmic rays does not\nrefute the dynamics we propose Photon decay, as well as Cherenkov radiation in vacuum\nby ordinary charged particles, remain forbidden for very high-energy cosmic rays as a\nconsequence of the sectorial universality of the critical speed in vacuum At the highest\nenergies observed (E ≈ 10 [20] eV, k ≈ 10 [25] cm [−][1] ), the ratio k [2] k 0 [−][2] is of order ≈ 10 [−][16]\n\n(above the bound from [8]) for k 0 ≈ 10 [−][33] cm It becomes as small as 10 [−][50] for\nk ≈ 10 [8] cm [−][1] (atomic distance scale) If laboratory distance and time scales are fixed\nfrom phenomena occuring at atomic or larger scales, the terms added to (1) do not seem\nto have a real influence on our natural definition of space and time If they ever become\n\n\n3\n\n\ndetectable, they will imply a definite failure of the relativity principle [9], as it will become\nimpossible to write the same equations of motion in all inertial frames A more detailed\ndiscussion of high-energy phenomena in similar situations is given in Subsection 2b 2b Mixing with superluminal sectors\n\n\nIn a previous paper [5], we pointed out that the existence of superluminal sectors of\nmatter is not by itself in conflict with the basic principles of standard cosmology [10] and\nquantum field theory (e g [11 - 13]) The new superluminal particles, which have positive\nmasses and energies, are clearly different from the previously proposed tachyons [14, 15]\nand have different signatures By definition, tachyons explicitly respect standard Lorentz\ninvariance, whereas our superluminal particles explicitly break it The superluminal sectors\ncan couple to the ordinary one, but Lorentz symmetry violations related to this mixing\nwould be very difficult to observe, as can be seen in two mixing schemes:\n\n\na) Scheme 1 The two sectorial symmetries, as well as the two multiplets, are identical\n(an isomorphism can be spontaneously generated) Then, a unique direct mixing scheme\nexists for particles of different sectors and all ordinary particles undergo the same kind\nof mixing with the superluminal sector In the vacuum rest frame, an ordinary particle\n| φ 0 - may mix with a superluminal one, | φ i -, through a hamiltonian H such that:\n\n\n< φ 0 | H | φ 0         - = c (p [2] + m [2] 0 [c] [2] [)] [1][/][2] = E 0 (3)\n\n\n< φ i | H | φ i         - = c i (p [2] + m [2] i [c] [2] i [)] [1][/][2] = E i (4)\n\n< φ 0 | H | φ i         - = < φ i | H | φ 0         - = ǫ (p [2] ) (5)\n\n\nwhere ⃗p is the momentum, p the modulus of ⃗p, m 0 the mass of the ordinary particle,\nm i the mass of the superluminal particle and ǫ the momentum-dependent energy mixing\nparameter Zero masses are preserved if ǫ (0) = 0 The eigenvectors of H are:\n\n\n| φ > = (1 − α [2] ) [1][/][2] | φ 0            - + α | φ i            - (6)\n\n\nwhere:\n2 α ǫ = E i − E 0 − [(E i − E 0 ) [2] + 4 ǫ [2] ] [1][/][2] (7)\n\n\ncorresponding to the mixed ordinary particle, with eigenvalue E given by:\n\n\n2E = E 0 + E i − [(E i − E 0 ) [2] + 4ǫ [2] ] [1][/][2] (8)\n\n\nand\n| φ [′]             - = (1 − α [2] ) [1][/][2] | φ i             - − α | φ 0             - (9)\n\n\nwhich corresponds to the mixed superluminal particle, with eigenvalue E [′] satisfying:\n\n\n2E [′] = E 0 + E i + [(E i − E 0 ) [2] + 4ǫ [2] ] [1][/][2] (10)\n\n\nIn the above expressions for E and E [′], the value of the square root is to be taken with\nthe same sign as E i − E 0 The speed of particle | φ > is given by:\n\n\n⃗ ⃗\nv (p) = ∇ ⃗p E = ⃗p [µ(p [2] )] [−][1] (11)\n\n\n4\n\n\nwhere µ(p [2] ) is an effective mass given by:\n\n\n[µ(p [2] )] [−][1] = 2 dE/dp [2] (12)\n\n\nǫ(p [2] ) breaks Lorentz symmetry and reflects unknown dynamics If ǫ(p [2] ) = a p + g (p [2] )\nwhere p [−][1] g (p [2] ) → 0 as p [2] →∞, the high-energy symmetry would require the value\nof a to be universal inside the sector, whereas g (p [2] ) can undergo the effect of low-energy\nsymmetry breaking Again, very high-energy cosmic rays will not exhibit phenomena like\nphoton decay or Cherenkov emission in vacuum by charged particles The high-energy\nspeed of all particles in the mixed ”ordinary” sector, as measured in the vacuum rest\nframe, will tend to v he, where 2 v he = c + c i + [(c − c i ) [2] + 4a [2] ] [1][/][2] If c i ≫ c\nand a ≪ c [2] i [, we get][ v] [he] ≃ c − a [2] c [−] i [1] where c [−][1] (v he − c) is of order ≈ 10 [−][2] for\na ≈ 10 [2] c and c i ≈ 10 [−][6] c Scenarios involving such figures would be excluded according\nto recent work by Coleman and Glashow [8] if, contrary to the case we are considering,\nthe shift in critical speed were not the same for all particles of the ordinary sector Thus,\nthe high-energy symmetry can play a crucial physical role which deserves further study For our laboratory definition of space and time, we should use the low-energy expansion\nof ǫ (p [2] ) Low-energy effects can be much smaller than high-energy effects if there is some\nhigh-momentum threshold contained in the p-dependence of ǫ(p [2] ) Assume that: a)\na ≈ 10 [2] c and m i c [2] i [≈] [1][ TeV][ ; b) between atomic scales and high energies,][ ǫ][(][p] [2] [) can be]\napproximated by the expression: ǫ (p [2] ) ≈ a p [3] (M [2] c [2] i [+][ p] [2] [)] [−][1] [ where][ M] [i] [c] [i] [≈] [1][ TeV/c]\nis the low-momentum cut-off At atomic scales, the energy mixing parameter ǫ will be of\norder ≈ 10 [−][13] eV and we get a relative effect of order ǫ [2] (m 0 c [2] 0 [m] [i] [ c] [2] i [)] [−][1] ≈ 10 [−][44] on\nthe electron wave equation Similarly, a free photon with the same values of ǫ (p [2] ) and\nm i c [2] i [would undergo an energy shift of][ ≈] [10] [−][38] [ eV][, which amounts at atomic scales to]\n≈ 10 [−][41] times its energy This does not in principle correspond to a mass, which may be\neven smaller, but is already below the most stringent experimental data: the p-dependence\nof ǫ can be made much weaker between the low-energy region and the cut-off With the\nprevious numbers, the photon velocity shift would be ≈ 10 [−][41] c and consequently, according\nto formulae from [6], we expect anisotropies in the value of the speed of light measured\non earth to be below ≈ 10 [−][44] c if the vacuum rest frame is close to that suggested by\ncosmic microwave background radiation Part of the effect will be washed out by the\nredefinition of space-time automatically performed by apparatus made of mixed ordinary\nmatter; this redefinition will in general depend on the material the apparatus is made of The laws of physics for the mixed ordinary sector will, at such precision levels, depend\non the laboratory velocity with respect to the vacuum rest frame The mixing with the\nsuperluminal particle at atomic scales would be ≈ 10 [−][25] and, if the interaction with the\nsuperluminal sector occurs only through direct mixing of single particles, the superluminal\ncontribution to an electromagnetic vertex of mixed ”ordinary” particles can be suppressed\nby an extremely small factor For all the discussed low-energy parameters, experiment\npermits much higher values than those obtained with our parametrization Thus, the space-time geometry felt by low-energy systems made of (mixed) ordinary\nmatter can show extremely small deviations from standard Lorentz invariance, even if a\nmore important effect arises in the kinematics of very high-energy cosmic rays It must\n\n\n5\n\n\nalso be realized that, even in the case of a small breaking of the high-energy symmetry,\nfinite-energy effects can partially protect high-energy cosmic rays For instance, with the\nabove parametrization, a 10 [13] eV photon would have an anomaly in the vacuum-rest-frame\nE/p ratio:\nE/p − c ≃ − a [2] c [−] i [1] (1 − 2p [−][2] c [2] i [M] [2] [)] (13)\n\n\nand, with the above parameters, p [−][2] c [2] i [M] [2] [ ≈] [10] [−][2] [ at][ E][ ≈] [10] [13] [ eV][ This term increases]\nthe energy/momentum ratio as the momentum is lowered, and ill severely limit the phase\nspace for a photon to decay into an electron-positron pair in the presence of a very small\nbreaking of the high-energy symmetry The effect will be even stronger if the momentum\ncutoff is higher than considered in our example, and may completely protect high-energy\ncosmic rays up to energies much higher than those observed Differences in speed will\nappear below the high-energy limit due to the finite-energy breaking of the high-energy\nsymmetry, but will not necessarily prevent the existence of high-energy cosmic rays The\nargument by Coleman and Glashow must be reconsidered in our scheme and, even in\nthe presence of an asymptotic or finite-energy breaking of the high-energy symmetry, it\nleads to less stringent bounds, not better than δ(E/p) (difference in E/p ratio) < 10 [−][11]\n\nobtained assuming that a 10 [20] eV proton exchanges all its momentum with another particle Bounds on δ(dE/dp) will be much weaker Breaking of the speed symmetry at high\nenergy, even by a finite energy effect, may have another important consequence: not only\nparticles which are stable at low momentum (in the vacuum rest frame) may be unstable\nat high momentum (as pointed out in [8] for the photon), but conversely unstable particles\nmay become stable when accelerated or produced at high momentum This may have\ncosmological implications and eventually be tested by high-energy experiments At p ≈ 1 TeV/c and with the above figures, we have ǫ (p [2] ) ≈ 10 [−][2] TeV and\na mixing parameter ≈ 10 [−][4] between ordinary and superluminal particles, which means\nthat the probability for two mixed quarks with TeV/c momenta to simultaneoulsy turn\ninto superluminal particles is ≈ 10 [−][16] (not necessarily negligible at LHC luminosities) Similarly, the probability for a hard virtual particle produced at LHC to become superluminal would be ≈ 10 [−][8], which again cannot be entirely disregarded Apart from direct\nproduction of superluminal particles, precision speed measurements for muons and protons\nat LHC energies deserve consideration Finally, it may be worth noticing that a mixing\nα ≈ 10 [−][4] in the ordinary sector would lead to interaction probabilites slightly lower than\nexpected, typically by a fraction ≈ 10 [−][3], and similarly for energy loses In the presence\nof interference phenomena, the effect may become larger",
    "In the presence\nof interference phenomena, the effect may become larger b) Scheme 2 If symmetries or multiplets are different and direct mixing between\nsingle particles from different sectors is forbidden, mixing between the two sectors can\nstill arise, for instance, through insertions of pairs of superluminal lines inside self-energy\ngraphs In this case, the energy of an ordinary particle can be written in terms of its\n\nmomentum as:\nE (p) = (p [2] + m [2] ) [1][/][2] + Σ (p [2] ) (14)\n\n\nwhere the first term ignores the mixing with the superluminal sector and Σ (p [2] ) contains\nthe superluminal insertions As before, we can write Σ (p [2] ) = s p + t (p [2] ), where\n\n\n6\n\n\np [−][1] t (p [2] ) → 0 as p →∞, and (using the high-energy symmetry) require the value of s\nto be universal inside the sector while t (p [2] ) can reflect the low-energy symmetry breaking Arguments similar to scheme 1 can then be developed, and again with the same philosophy we may expect very small numbers in direct searches for Lorentz invariance violations\nat low energy even if high-energy effects turn out to be detectable A particularly interesting possibility would be that the Higgs boson couples to a superluminal scalar through\na φ [4] term in the lagrangian (the squared modulus of the Higgs field times the squared\nmodulus of the superluminal scalar field like in [1]), and that the superluminal boson has\na rest energy in the TeV range Then, the new physics expected at TeV scales on the\ngrounds of Higgs theory considerations could directly involve the production of pairs of\nsuperluminal particles, together with other departures from the standard model 3",
    "3 DIRECT SEARCH FOR SUPERLUMINAL PARTICLES\n\n\nWith the same figures as before, LHC collisions can potentially involve interactions\nbetween superluminal components of the high-energy particles To the already specified suppression factors, we may be led to add phase space limitations If, for instance,\nc i ≈ 10 [6] c as before, naive on-shell kinematics would require the momenta of the incoming\nquarks to cancel with 10 [−][6] precision if superluminal particles must emerge from the collision (otherwise, there would not be enough energy left to produce the free superluminal\nparticles) We would then expect a strong extra supression factor from these considerations, although our lack of knowledge of the dynamics of superluminal particles prevents\nus from formulating definite conclusions (for instance, some dramatic effect might be generated by a pair of strongly off-shell superluminal particles) On the other hand, going\nbeyond point-like field theory, it should be noticed that Lorentz contraction of ordinary\nparticles may modify their direct mixing with the superluminal sector (see [6] on the absolute physical meaning of Lorentz contraction and its matter-dependence), as it modifies\nthe relative longitudinal size between ordinary and superluminal particles If superluminal particles are smaller by orders of magnitude than ordinary ones (which would most\nlikely occur if k i ≫ k 0 ), Lorentz contraction of ordinary particles may lead to further\nenhancement of direct coupling between particles from the two sectors Such effects are\nnew with respect to coventional particle physics, where Lorentz contraction is a relative\nphenomenon The situation would even become more favourable in future generations of\nhigher-energy accelerators In the case of direct mixing, the mixing parameter α will reach\nits asymptotic value only well above the rest energy m i c [2] i [of the superluminal particle under]\nconsideration In any case, it seems that some scenarios with superluminal particles can\nbe explored by LHC experiments, mainly for values of c i between c and 10 [6] c We shall\nnot attempt to give here a general parametrization, but obvious examples can be built,\nespecially for critical speeds in vacuum one or two orders of magnitude above c Beam\nquality will play a crucial role to precisely define these potentialities High-energy cosmic rays of the superluminal sector under consideration would satisfy\nmodified versions of the GZK cutoff [16] allowing for higher energies and larger source\ndistances, and possibly reach cosmic ray detectors on earth, like AMANDA [17] Particles\n\n\n7\n\n\nfrom other superluminal sectors, more weakly coupled to ordinary matter, would be much\nless contrained by the GZK cutoff The main limitation for a superluminal cosmic ray to\nbe able to reach earth is likely to come from ”Cherenkov” radiation (i e the emission of\nparticles belonging to a sector with lower critical speed) in vacuum However, if superluminal matter is very abundant in the Universe, this abundance may generate other cutoffs\nof the GZK type for superluminal particles The superluminal particles possibly produced\nat accelerators will in general not be the same that we can observe in cosmic ray detectors,\nespecially if several superluminal sectors of matter exist The fact that very high-energy\nordinary particles may undergo mixing with superluminal sectors is potentially a motivation for detailed measurements (e",
    "The fact that very high-energy\nordinary particles may undergo mixing with superluminal sectors is potentially a motivation for detailed measurements (e g speed, ”Cherenkov” emission in vacuum even at small\nrates ) in high-energy cosmic-ray detectors We therefore claim that the impressive results of low-energy searches for Lorentz symmetry violation at low energy, excluding such phenomena down to very small numbers\n(e We therefore claim that the impressive results of low-energy searches for Lorentz symmetry violation at low energy, excluding such phenomena down to very small numbers\n(e g [18, 19]), do really not allow to conclude against the potentialities of the search for\nsuperluminal particles in high-energy experiments On the contrary, high-energy experiments may indeed be the only way to find evidence for Lorentz symmetry violation, as well\nas for the existence of superluminal sectors As stressed in our previous papers (e g g [1,\n5]), the observed stability of Lorentz invariance in the low-energy region and the possible\ndiscovery of superluminal particles in high-energy experiments are not really incompatible,\nsince Lorentz symmetry violation would be essentially related to phenomena occuring at\nvery high energy and very short distance scales Massless ordinary particles may even have\ndifferent low-energy and high-energy speeds in vacuum, as discussed above Signatures in high-energy experiments are a crucial point: can we identify superluminal particles in such experiments Cherenkov radiation in vacuum (e g the emission of\nordinary particles by the produced superluminal ones) may be a crucial signature in many\ncases At accelerators, its structure and energy dependence would be easy to identify In\ncosmic ray experiments, it may be detectable even if the particle couples very weakly to\nordinary matter Ordinary cosmic rays resulting from this emission can reach the detector, even if the superluminal particle does not Then, the event could most likely not by\nexplained in terms of known astrophysical sources In all cases, because of the very high\nenergy/momentum ratio in the new dynamical sector, ”Cherenkov” radiation in vacuum\nby superluminal particles will present special features At an angle of π/2 with respect to\nits momentum, a relativistic superluminal particle (i e at speed v i ∼ c i ) with momentum p i and energy E i in the vacuum rest frame can emit an ordinary particle with energy\nE ≈ E i c [2] c [−] i [2] and momentum p ≈ E i c c [−] i [2] ≃ p i c c [−] i [1] This is the highest possible\nmomentum of an emitted single particle The longitudinal momentum of emitted single\nparticles, with respect to the direction of motion of the superluminal particle, is strongly\nlimited Cherenkov radiation in vacuum will most likely be mainly made of very heavy\nvirtual particles quickly decaying into pairs of jets (hadronic or leptonic) back-to-back in\norder to account for the small momentum left Conversion of these vacuum-rest-frame\nfigures to the laboratory rest frame can be made according to formulae developed in [6]",
    "Conversion of these vacuum-rest-frame\nfigures to the laboratory rest frame can be made according to formulae developed in [6] Other signatures exist as well and can be explored As stressed in previous papers\n\n[5, 6], if a high-energy superluminal cosmic ray undergoes a hard interaction inside the\n\n\n8\n\n\ndetector releasing a sizeable part of its energy, we expect in most cases the production\nof two jets ”back-to-back” due to energy and momentum conservation Furthermore, the\nevent distribution would be nearly isotropic as a result of the relation between the energy\nand momentum of the superluminal particle Such a signature would be unambiguous,\neven at very small event rate Similarly, precise timing in accelerator experiments may\nprovide dramatic signatures [6] Absolute time resolution below 10 [−][8] s would in principle\nallow to directly notice a speed well above c in a 10 m detector Absolute time resolution below 10 [−][8] s would in principle\nallow to directly notice a speed well above c in a 10 m detector 4 4 NEUTRINO AND OSCILLATION SIGNATURES\n\n\nAs previoulsy suggested in our papers [1 - 6], and discussed by Coleman and Glashow\nin their recent study [8], a small violation of Lorentz invariance may lead to observable\neffects in neutrino physics The numbers obtained above do not allow, in our scenario, to\nexclude Lorentz symmetry violation from low-energy neutrino data, but make further experiments particularly relevant and necessary Furthermore, other particles than neutrinos\ncan undergo velocity oscillations, especially at high energy, if such oscillations are allowed Due to the existence of a preferred frame and to the intrinsic meaning of velocity\nwith respect to this frame, there is a real physical difference between oscillations and\nhigh and low momenta A high-energy particle is intrinsically different from a low-energy\nparticle: no Lorentz transformation can make them completely equivalent Exclusion plots\nfor oscillations should include momentum-dependence if Lorentz invariance is broken, as\nthey test different physical objects when the speed is modified While low-energy and\nnuclear physics experiments can test important aspects of neutrino oscillations, including\nLorentz invariance, these phenomena are not necessarily the same that can be potentially\nuncovered by high-energy experiments Also, in scenarios like that of Subsection 2b,\nScheme 1, the global high-energy symmetry is preserved but gauge symmetries become\nsectorial and approximate when mixing between the two sectors is introduced Therefore,\nhigh-energy experiments may indeed be able to test new physics related to this mixing If the above high-energy symmetry undergoes a small breaking leading to differences\nin high-energy speeds escaping the Coleman-Glashow constraints (e g Subsection 2b,\nScheme 1), the experimental consequences can be important even if very high-energy cosmic\nrays (e g protons and photons) remain allowed At TeV energies, and assuming masses\nto be small enough (typically, δm [2] c [5] sin2θ m ≪ E [2] δv sin2θ v, where E is the energy, m [2]\n\nthe difference in squared mass, θ m the mass mixing angle and θ v the velocity mixing angle\n\n[8]), with a velocity symmetry breaking δv v [−][1] ≈ 10 [−][19], oscillation would occur at the\nscale of the detector size for all produced ordinary particles able to oscillate Well above\nthis value of δv v [−][1], the mixing would be full Such considerations are not only relevant\nfor neutrinos: for instance, mixing with the superluminal sector at high momentum may\nresult in high-energy mixing between charged leptons In this case, the oscillation will\ndepend on the details of the p-dependence of the mixing (which reflects in turn unknown\ndetails of dynamics inside the superluminal sector) Again, the mixing can be very small\nat low energy but significant at high energy, similar to Subsection 2b LHC and cosmic\nray experiments may be able to put relevant bounds on such phenomena 9\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] L Gonzalez-Mestres, ”Properties of a possible class of particles able to travel faster
