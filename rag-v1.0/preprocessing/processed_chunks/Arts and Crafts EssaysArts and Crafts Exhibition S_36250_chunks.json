nevertheless, so hopelessly hideous and vulgar is general building\nthat persons of taste find themselves regretting the brown brick box\nwith its feeble and trumpery attempts at ornament, which\ncharacterises the style of building current at the end of the last and\nbeginning of this century, because there is some style about it, and\neven some merit of design, if only negative The position which we have to face then is this: the lack of beauty in\nmodern life (of decoration in the best sense of the word), which in the\nearlier part of the century was unnoticed, is now recognised by a part\nof the public as an evil to be remedied if possible; but by far the larger\npart of civilised mankind does not feel that lack in the least, so that no\ngeneral sense of beauty is extant which would force us into the\ncreation of a feeling for art which in its turn would force us into\ntaking up the dropped links of tradition, and once more producing\ngenuine organic art Such art as we have is not the work of the mass\nof craftsmen unconscious of any definite style, but producing beauty\ninstinctively; conscious rather of the desire to turn out a creditable\n\n\npiece of work than of any aim towards positive beauty That is the\nessential motive power towards art in past ages; but our art is the\nwork of a small minority composed of educated persons, fully\nconscious of their aim of producing beauty, and distinguished from\nthe great body of workmen by the possession of that aim I do not, indeed, ignore the fact that there is a school of artists\nbelonging to this decade who set forth that beauty is not an essential\npart of art; which they consider rather as an instrument for the\nstatement of fact, or an exhibition of the artist's intellectual\nobservation and skill of hand Such a school would seem at first sight\nto have an interest of its own as a genuine traditional development of\nthe art of the eighteenth century, which, like all intellectual\nmovements in that century, was negative and destructive; and this all\nthe more as the above-mentioned school is connected with science\nrather than art But on looking closer into the matter it will be seen\nthat this school cannot claim any special interest on the score of\ntradition For the eighteenth century art was quite unconscious of its\ntendency towards ugliness and nullity, whereas the modern\n\"Impressionists\" loudly proclaim their enmity to beauty, and are no\nmore unconscious of their aim than the artists of the revival are of\ntheir longing to link themselves to the traditional art of the past Here we have then, on the one hand, a school which is pushing rather\nthan drifting into the domain of the empirical science of to-day, and\nanother which can only work through its observation of an art which\nwas once organic, but which died centuries ago, leaving us what by\nthis time has become but the wreckage of its brilliant and eager life,\nwhile at the same time the great mass of civilisation lives on content\nto forgo art almost altogether Nevertheless the artists of both the\nschools spoken of are undoubtedly honest and eager in pursuit of art\nunder the conditions of modern civilisation; that is to say, that they\nhave this much in common with the schools of tradition, that they do\nwhat they are impelled to do, and that the public would be quite\nwrong in supposing them to be swayed by mere affectation Now it seems to me that this impulse in men of certain minds and\nmoods towards certain forms of art, this genuine eclecticism, is all\nthat we can expect under modern civilisation; that we can expect no\ngeneral impulse towards the fine arts till civilisation has been\ntransformed into some other condition of life, the details of which we\n\n\ncannot foresee Let us then make the best of it, and admit that those\nwho practise art must nowadays be conscious of that practice;\nconscious I mean that they are either adding a certain amount of\nartistic beauty and interest to a piece of goods which would, if\nproduced in the ordinary way, have no beauty or artistic interest, or\nto produce works of art, to supply the lack of tradition by diligently\ncultivating in ourselves the sense of beauty (pace the Impressionists),\nskill of hand, and niceness of observation, without which only a\nmakeshift of art can be got; and also, so far as we can, to call the\nattention of the public to the fact that there are a few persons who are\ndoing this, and even earning a livelihood by so doing, and that\ntherefore, in spite of the destructive tradition of our immediate past,\nin spite of the great revolution in the production of wares, which this\ncentury only has seen on the road to completion, and which on the\nface of it, and perhaps essentially, is hostile to art, in spite of all\ndifficulties which the evolution of the later days of society has thrown\nin the way of that side of human pleasure which is called art, there is\nstill a minority with a good deal of life in it which is not content with\nwhat is called utilitarianism, which, being interpreted, means the\nreckless waste of life in the pursuit of the means of life It is this conscious cultivation of art and the attempt to interest the\npublic in it which the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society has set itself\nto help, by calling special attention to that really most important side\nof art, the decoration of utilities by furnishing them with genuine\nartistic finish in place of trade finish WILLIAM MORRIS July 1893 CONTENTS\nPAGE\nOf the Revival of Design and Handicraft: with Notes on\nthe Work of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society Walter Crane\n1\nTextiles William Morris\n22\nOf Decorative Painting and Design Walter Crane\n39\nOf Wall Papers Walter Crane\n52\nFictiles G T Robinson\n62\nMetal Work W A S Benson\n68\nStone and Wood Carving Somers Clarke\n81\nFurniture Stephen Webb\n89\nStained Glass Somers Clarke\n98\nTable Glass Somers Clarke\n106\nPrinting William Morris and Emery Walker\n111\nBookbinding",

and it is a somewhat singular state of things that at\na time when the Arts are perhaps more looked after, and certainly\nmore talked about, than they have ever been before, and the\nbeautifying of houses, to those to whom it is possible, has become in\nsome cases almost a religion, so little is known of the actual designer\nand maker (as distinct from the proprietary manufacturer or\nmiddleman) of those familiar things which contribute so much to the\ncomfort and refinement of life—of our chairs and cabinets, our\nchintzes and wall-papers, our lamps and pitchers—the Lares and\nPenates of our households, which with the touch of time and\nassociation often come to be regarded with so peculiar an affection Nor is this condition of affairs in regard to applied Art without an\nexplanation, since it is undeniable that under the modern industrial\nsystem that personal element, which is so important in all forms of\nArt, has been thrust farther and farther into the background, until the\nproduction of what are called ornamental objects, and the supply of\nornamental additions generally, instead of growing out of organic\nnecessities, have become, under a misapplication of machinery, driven\nby the keen competition of trade, purely commercial affairs—\nquestions of the supply and demand of the market artificially\nstimulated and controlled by the arts of the advertiser and the\nsalesman bidding against each other for the favour of a capricious and\npassing fashion, which too often takes the place of a real love of Art in\nour days Of late years, however, a kind of revival has been going on, as a\nprotest against the conviction that, with all our modern mechanical\nachievements, comforts, and luxuries, life is growing \"uglier every\n\n\nday,\" as Mr Morris puts it Even our painters are driven to rely rather\non the accidental beauty which, like a struggling ray through a\nLondon fog, sometimes illumes and transfigures the sordid\ncommonplace of everyday life We cannot, however, live on\nsensational effects without impairing our sense of form and balance—\nof beauty, in short We cannot concentrate our attention on pictorial\nand graphic art, and come to regard it as the one form worth\npursuing, without losing our sense of construction and power of\nadaptation in design to all kinds of very different materials and\npurposes—that sense of relation—that architectonic sense which built\nup the great monuments of the past The true root and basis of all Art lies in the handicrafts If there is no\nroom or chance of recognition for really artistic power and feeling in\ndesign and craftsmanship—if Art is not recognised in the humblest\nobject and material, and felt to be as valuable in its own way as the\nmore highly rewarded pictorial skill—the arts cannot be in a sound\ncondition; and if artists cease to be found among the crafts there is\ngreat danger that they will vanish from the arts also, and become\nmanufacturers and salesmen instead It was with the object of giving some visible expression to these views\nthat the Exhibitions of the Arts and Crafts Society were organised As was to be expected, many difficulties had to be encountered In the\nendeavour to assign due credit to the responsible designer and\nworkman, it was found sometimes difficult to do so amid the very\nnumerous artificers (in some cases) who under our industrial\nconditions contribute to the production of a work It will readily be understood that the organisation of exhibitions of\nthis character, and with such objects as have been stated, is a far less\nsimple matter than an ordinary picture exhibition Instead of having\nan array of artists whose names and addresses are in every catalogue,\nour constituency, as it were, outside the personal knowledge of the\nCommittee, had to be discovered Under the designation of So-and-so\nand Co many a skilful designer and craftsman may be concealed; and\nindividual and independent artists in design and handicraft are as yet\nfew and far between However, in the belief, as elsewhere expressed, that it is little good\nnourishing the tree at the head if it is dying at the root, and that,\n\n\nliving or dying, the desirability of an accurate diagnosis while there is\nany doubt of our artistic health will at once be admitted, the Society\ndetermined to try the experiment and so opened their first Exhibition The reception given to it having so far justified our plea for the due\nrecognition of the arts and crafts of design, and our belief in their\nfundamental importance—the amount of public interest and support\naccorded to the Exhibition having, in fact, far exceeded our\nanticipations, it was determined to hold a second on the same lines,\nand to endeavour to carry out, with more completeness than was at\nfirst found possible, those principles of work, ideas, and aims in art\nfor which we contended, and to make the Exhibition a rallying point,\nas it were, for all sympathetic workers Regarding design as a species of language capable of very varied\nexpression through the medium of different methods and materials, it\nnaturally follows that there is all the difference in the world between\none treatment and another, both of design and material; and,\nmoreover, every material has its own proper capacity and appropriate\nrange of expression, so that it becomes the business of the sympathetic\nworkman to discover this and give it due expansion For the absence of this discriminating sense no amount of mechanical\nsmoothness or imitative skill can compensate; and it is obvious that\nany attempt to imitate or render the qualities peculiar to one material\nin another leads the workman on a false track Now, we have only to consider how much of the work commonly\nproduced, which comes under the head of what is called \"industrial\nart,\" depends upon this very false quality of imitation (whether as to\ndesign or material) to show how far we have departed in the ordinary\nprocesses of manufacture and standards of trade from primitive and\ntrue artistic instincts The demand, artificially stimulated, is less for\nthought or beauty than for novelty, and all sorts of mechanical\ninvention are applied, chiefly with the view of increasing the rate of\nproduction and diminishing its cost, regardless of the fact that\nanything in the nature of bad or false art is dear at any price Plain materials and surfaces are infinitely preferable to inorganic and\ninappropriate ornament; yet there is not the simplest article of\ncommon use made by the hand of man that is not capable of receiving\nsome touch of art—whether it lies in the planning and proportions, or\n\n\nin the final decorative adornment; whether in the work of the smith,\nthe carpenter, the carver, the weaver, or the potter, and the other\nindispensable crafts With the organisation of industry on the grand scale, and the\nenormous application of machinery in the interests of competitive\nproduction for profit, when both art and industry are forced to make\ntheir appeal to the unreal and impersonal average, rather than to the\nreal and personal you and me, it is not wonderful that beauty should\nhave become divorced from use, and that attempts to concede its\ndemands, and the desire for it, should too often mean the ill-\nconsidered bedizenment of meaningless and unrelated ornament The very producer, the designer, and craftsman, too, has been lost\nsight of, and his personality submerged in that of a business firm, so\nthat we have reached the reductio ad absurdum of an impersonal artist\nor craftsman trying to produce things of beauty for an impersonal and\nunknown public—a purely conjectural matter from first to last Under such conditions it is hardly surprising that the arts of design\nshould have declined, and that the idea of art should have become\nlimited to pictorial work (where, at least, the artist may be known, in\nsome relation to his public, and comparatively free) Partly as a protest against this state of things, and partly to\nconcentrate the awakened feeling for beauty in the accessories of life,\nthe Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society commenced their work The movement, however, towards a revival of design and handicraft,\nthe effort to unite—or rather to re-unite—the artist and the craftsman,\nso sundered by the industrial conditions of our century, has been\ngrowing and gathering force for some time past It reflects in art the\nintellectual movement of inquiry into fundamental principles and\nnecessities, and is a practical expression of the philosophy of the\nconditioned It is true it has many different sides and manifestations,\nand is under many different influences and impelled by different aims With some the question is closely connected with the commercial\nprosperity of England, and her prowess in the competitive race for\nwealth; with others it is enough if the social well-being and happiness\nof her people is advanced, and that the touch of art should lighten the\ntoil of joyless lives The movement, indeed, represents in some sense a\nrevolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its\n\n\ninsensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament) It is a\nprotest against that so-called industrial progress which produces\nshoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their\nproducers and the degradation of their users It is a protest against the\nturning of men into machines, against artificial distinctions in art, and\nagainst making the immediate market value, or possibility of profit,\nthe chief test of artistic merit It also advances the claim of all and\neach to the common possession of beauty in things common and\nfamiliar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty, deadened and\ndepressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by luxurious\nsuperfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest\nnecessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to\nspeak of the everyday uglinesses to which we have accustomed our\neyes, confused by the flood of false taste, or darkened by the hurried\nlife of modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist,\nequally removed from both art and nature and their kindly and\nrefining influences It asserts, moreover, the value of the practice of handicraft as a good\ntraining for the faculties, and as a most valuable counteraction to that\noverstraining of purely mental effort under the fierce competitive\nconditions of the day; apart from the very wholesome and real\npleasure in the fashioning of a thing with claims to art and beauty, the\nstruggle with and triumph over the stubborn technical necessities\nwhich refuse to be gainsaid And, finally, thus claiming for man this\nprimitive and common delight in common things made beautiful, it\nmakes, through art, the great socialiser for a common and kindred\nlife, for sympathetic and helpful fellowship, and demands conditions\nunder which your artist and craftsman shall be free \"See how great a matter a little fire kindleth \" Some may think this is\nan extensive programme—a remote ideal for a purely artistic\nmovement to touch Yet if the revival of art and handicraft is not a\nmere theatric and imitative impulse; if it is not merely to gratify a\npassing whim of fashion, or demand of commerce; if it has reality and\nroots of its own; if it is not merely a delicate luxury—a little glow of\ncolour at the end of a sombre day—it can hardly mean less than what\nI have written It must mean either the sunset or the dawn The success which had hitherto attended the efforts of our Society, the\nsympathy and response elicited by the claims which had been\n\n\nadvanced by us on behalf of the Arts and Crafts of Design, and\n(despite difficulties and imperfections) I think it may be said the\ncharacter of our exhibitions, and last, but not least, the public interest\nand support, manifested in various ways, and from different parts of\nthe country, went far to prove both their necessity and importance We were therefore encouraged to open a third Exhibition in the\nautumn of 1890 In this last it was the Society's object to make in it\nleading features of two crafts in which good design and handicraft are\nof the utmost importance, namely, Furniture and Embroidery; and\nendeavours were made to get together good examples of each It may be noted that while some well-known firms, who had hitherto\nheld aloof, now exhibited with us, the old difficulty about the names\nof the responsible executants continued; but while some evaded the\nquestion, others were models of exactitude in this respect, proving\nthat in this as in other questions where there is a will there is a way The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, while at first, of necessity,\ndepending on the work of a comparatively limited circle, had no wish\nto be narrower than the recognition of certain fundamental principles\nin design will allow, and, indeed, desired but to receive and to show\nthe best after its kind in contemporary design and handicraft Judgment is not always infallible, and the best is not always\nforthcoming, and in a mixed exhibition it is difficult to maintain an\nunvarying standard At present, indeed, an exhibition may be said to\nbe but a necessary evil; but it is the only means of obtaining a\nstandard, and giving publicity to the works of Designer and\nCraftsman; but it must be more or less of a compromise, and of course\nno more can be done than to make an exhibition of contemporary\nwork representative of current ideas and skill, since it is impossible to\nget outside our own time In some quarters it appears to have been supposed that our\nExhibitions are intended to appeal, by the exhibition of cheap and\nsaleable articles, to what are rudely termed \"the masses\"; we appeal to\nall certainly, but it should be remembered that cheapness in art and\nhandicraft is well-nigh impossible, save in some forms of more or less\nmechanical reproduction In fact, cheapness as a rule, in the sense of\nlow-priced production, can only be obtained at the cost of cheapness\n—that is, the cheapening of human life and labour; surely, in reality, a\n\n\nmost wasteful and extravagant cheapness It is difficult to see how,\nunder present economic conditions, it can be otherwise Art is, in its\ntrue sense, after all, the crown and flowering of life and labour, and\nwe cannot reasonably expect to gain that crown except at the true\nvalue of the human life and labour of which it is the result Of course there is the difference of cost between materials to be taken\ninto account: a table may be of oak or of deal; a cloth may be of silk\nor of linen; but the labour, skill, taste, intelligence, thought, and\nfancy, which give the sense of art to the work, are much the same,\nand, being bound up with human lives, need the means of life in its\ncompletion for their proper sustenance At all events, I think it may be said that the principle of the essential\nunity and interdependence of the arts has been again asserted—the\nbrotherhood of designer and craftsman; that goes for something, with\nwhatever imperfections or disadvantages its acknowledgment may\nhave been obscured In putting this principle before the public, the Arts and Crafts\nExhibition Society has availed itself from the first of both lecture and\nessay, as well as the display of examples Lectures and demonstrations\nwere given during the progress of the Exhibitions, and essays written\nby well-known workers in the crafts of which they treated have\naccompanied the catalogues These papers have now been collected\ntogether, and revised by their authors, and appear in book form under\nthe editorship of Mr William Morris, whose name has been practically\nassociated with the revival of beauty in the arts and crafts of design in\nmany ways before our Society came into existence, and who with his\nco-workers may be said to have been the pioneer of our English\nRenascence, which it is our earnest desire to foster and perpetuate Every movement which has any substance and vitality must expect to\nencounter misrepresentation, and even abuse, as well as sympathy\nand support In its work, so far, the Society to which I have the\nhonour to belong has had its share of both, perhaps Those pledged to the support of existing conditions, whether in art or\nsocial life, are always sensitive to attacks upon their weak points, and\nit is not possible to avoid touching them to any man who ventures to\nlook an inch or two beyond the immediate present But the hostility of\nsome is as much a mark of vitality and progress as the sympathy of\n\n\nothers The sun strikes hottest as the traveller climbs the hill; and we\nmust be content to leave the value of our work to the unfailing test of\ntime",
    "The sun strikes hottest as the traveller climbs the hill; and we\nmust be content to leave the value of our work to the unfailing test of\ntime Walter Crane Walter Crane TEXTILES\nThere are several ways of ornamenting a woven cloth: (1) real\ntapestry, (2) carpet-weaving, (3) mechanical weaving, (4) printing or\npainting, and (5) embroidery There has been no improvement\n(indeed, as to the main processes, no change) in the manufacture of\nthe wares in all these branches since the fourteenth century, as far as\nthe wares themselves are concerned; whatever improvements have\nbeen introduced have been purely commercial, and have had to do\nmerely with reducing the cost of production; nay, more, the\ncommercial improvements have on the whole been decidedly\ninjurious to the quality of the wares themselves The noblest of the weaving arts is Tapestry, in which there is nothing\nmechanical: it may be looked upon as a mosaic of pieces of colour\nmade up of dyed threads, and is capable of producing wall ornament\nof any degree of elaboration within the proper limits of duly\nconsidered decorative work As in all wall-decoration, the first thing to be considered in the\ndesigning of Tapestry is the force, purity, and elegance of the\nsilhouette of the objects represented, and nothing vague or\nindeterminate is admissible But special excellences can be expected\nfrom it Depth of tone, richness of colour, and exquisite gradation of\ntints are easily to be obtained in Tapestry; and it also demands that\ncrispness and abundance of beautiful detail which was the especial\ncharacteristic of fully developed Mediæval Art The style of even the\nbest period of the Renaissance is wholly unfit for Tapestry:\naccordingly we find that Tapestry retained its Gothic character longer\nthan any other of the pictorial arts A comparison of the wall-hangings\nin the Great Hall at Hampton Court with those in the Solar or\nDrawing-room, will make this superiority of the earlier design for its\npurpose clear to any one not lacking in artistic perception: and the\ncomparison is all the fairer, as both the Gothic tapestries of the Solar\nand the post-Gothic hangings of the Hall are pre-eminently good of\ntheir kinds Not to go into a description of the process of weaving\ntapestry, which would be futile without illustrations, I may say that in\ncontradistinction to mechanical weaving, the warp is quite hidden,\nwith the result that the colours are as solid as they can be made in\n\n\npainting Carpet-weaving is somewhat of the nature of Tapestry: it also is\nwholly unmechanical, but its use as a floor-cloth somewhat degrades\nit, especially in our northern or western countries, where people come\nout of the muddy streets into rooms without taking off their shoes Carpet-weaving undoubtedly arose among peoples living a tent life,\nand for such a dwelling as a tent, carpets are the best possible\nornaments Carpets form a mosaic of small squares of worsted, or hair, or silk\nthreads, tied into a coarse canvas, which is made as the work\nprogresses Owing to the comparative coarseness of the work, the\ndesigns should always be very elementary in form, and suggestive\nmerely of forms of leafage, flowers, beasts and birds, etc The soft\ngradations of tint to which Tapestry lends itself are unfit for Carpet-\nweaving; beauty and variety of colour must be attained by\nharmonious juxtaposition of tints, bounded by judiciously chosen\noutlines; and the pattern should lie absolutely flat upon the ground On the whole, in designing carpets the method of contrast is the best\none to employ, and blue and red, quite frankly used, with white or\nvery light outlines on a dark ground, and black or some very dark\ncolour on a light ground, are the main colours on which the designer\nshould depend In making the above remarks I have been thinking only of the genuine\nor hand-made carpets The mechanically-made carpets of to-day must\nbe looked upon as makeshifts for cheapness' sake Of these, the velvet\npile and Brussels are simply coarse worsted velvets woven over wires\nlike other velvet, and cut, in the case of the velvet pile; and\nKidderminster carpets are stout cloths, in which abundance of warp (a\nwarp to each weft) is used for the sake of wear and tear The velvet\ncarpets need the same kind of design as to colour and quality as the\nreal carpets; only, as the colours are necessarily limited in number,\nand the pattern must repeat at certain distances, the design should be\nsimpler and smaller than in a real carpet A Kidderminster carpet calls\nfor a small design in which the different planes, or plies, as they are\ncalled, are well interlocked Mechanical weaving has to repeat the pattern on the cloth within\ncomparatively narrow limits; the number of colours also is limited in\n\n\nmost cases to four or five In most cloths so woven, therefore, the best\nplan seems to be to choose a pleasant ground colour and to\nsuperimpose a pattern mainly composed of either a lighter shade of\nthat colour, or a colour in no very strong contrast to the ground; and\nthen, if you are using several colours, to light up this general\narrangement either with a more forcible outline, or by spots of\nstronger colour carefully disposed Often the lighter shade on the\ndarker suffices, and hardly calls for anything else: some very beautiful\ncloths are merely damasks, in which the warp and weft are of the\nsame colour, but a different tone is obtained by the figure and the\nground being woven with a longer or shorter twill: the tabby being\ntied by the warp very often, the satin much more rarely In any case,\nthe patterned webs produced by mechanical weaving, if the ornament\nis to be effective and worth the doing, require that same Gothic\ncrispness and clearness of detail which has been spoken of before: the\ngeometrical structure of the pattern, which is a necessity in all\nrecurring patterns, should be boldly insisted upon, so as to draw the\neye from accidental figures, which the recurrence of the pattern is apt\nto produce The meaningless stripes and spots and other tormentings of the simple\ntwill of the web, which are so common in the woven ornament of the\neighteenth century and in our own times, should be carefully avoided:\nall these things are the last resource of a jaded invention and a\ncontempt of the simple and fresh beauty that comes of a sympathetic\nsuggestion of natural forms: if the pattern be vigorously and firmly\ndrawn with a true feeling for the beauty of line and silhouette, the play\nof light and shade on the material of the simple twill will give all the\nnecessary variety I invite my readers to make another comparison: to\ngo to the South Kensington Museum and study the invaluable\nfragments of the stuffs of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries of\nSyrian and Sicilian manufacture, or the almost equally beautiful webs\nof Persian design, which are later in date, but instinct with the purest\nand best Eastern feeling; they may also note the splendid stuffs\nproduced mostly in Italy in the later Middle Ages, which are\nunsurpassed for richness and effect of design, and when they have\nimpressed their minds with the productions of this great historic\nschool, let them contrast with them the work of the vile Pompadour\nperiod, passing by the early seventeenth century as a period of\ntransition into corruption They will then (if, once more, they have\n\n\nreal artistic perception) see at once the difference between the results\nof irrepressible imagination and love of beauty, on the one hand, and,\non the other, of restless and weary vacuity of mind, forced by the\nexigencies of fashion to do something or other to the innocent surface\nof the cloth in order to distinguish it in the market from other cloths;\nbetween the handiwork of the free craftsman doing as he pleased with\nhis work, and the drudgery of the \"operative\" set to his task by the\ntradesman competing for the custom of a frivolous public, which had\nforgotten that there was such a thing as art The next method of ornamenting cloth is by painting it or printing on\nit with dyes As to the painting of cloths with dyes by hand, which is\nno doubt a very old and widely practised art, it has now quite\ndisappeared (modern society not being rich enough to pay the\nnecessary price for such work), and its place has now been taken by\nprinting by block or cylinder-machine The remarks made on the\ndesign for mechanically woven cloths apply pretty much to these\nprinted stuffs: only, in the first place, more play of delicate and pretty\ncolour is possible, and more variety of colour also; and in the second,\nmuch more use can be made of hatching and dotting, which are\nobviously suitable to the method of block-printing In the many-\ncoloured printed cloths, frank red and blue are again the mainstays of\nthe colour arrangement; these colours, softened by the paler shades of\nred, outlined with black and made more tender by the addition of\nyellow in small quantities, mostly forming part of brightish greens,\nmake up the colouring of the old Persian prints, which carry the art as\nfar as it can be carried It must be added that no textile ornament has suffered so much as\ncloth-printing from those above-mentioned commercial inventions A\nhundred years ago the processes for printing on cloth differed little\nfrom those used by the Indians and Persians; and even up to within\nforty years ago they produced colours that were in themselves good\nenough, however inartistically they might be used Then came one of\nthe most wonderful and most useless of the inventions of modern\nChemistry, that of the dyes made from coal-tar, producing a series of\nhideous colours, crude, livid—and cheap,—which every person of\ntaste loathes, but which nevertheless we can by no means get rid of\nuntil we are able to struggle successfully against the doom of cheap\nand nasty which has overtaken us Last of the methods of ornamenting cloth comes Embroidery: of the\ndesign for which it must be said that one of its aims should be the\nexhibition of beautiful material Furthermore, it is not worth doing\nunless it is either very copious and rich, or very delicate—or both For\nsuch an art nothing patchy or scrappy, or half-starved, should be\ndone: there is no excuse for doing anything which is not strikingly\nbeautiful; and that more especially as the exuberance of beauty of the\nwork of the East and of Mediæval Europe, and even of the time of the\nRenaissance, is at hand to reproach us It may be well here to warn\nthose occupied in Embroidery against the feeble imitations of\nJapanese art which are so disastrously common amongst us The\nJapanese are admirable naturalists, wonderfully skilful draughtsmen,\ndeft beyond all others in mere execution of whatever they take in\nhand; and also great masters of style within certain narrow\nlimitations But with all this, a Japanese design is absolutely worthless\nunless it is executed with Japanese skill In truth, with all their\nbrilliant qualities as handicraftsmen, which have so dazzled us, the\nJapanese have no architectural, and therefore no decorative, instinct Their works of art are isolated and blankly individualistic, and in\nconsequence, unless where they rise, as they sometimes do, to the\ndignity of a suggestion for a picture (always devoid of human\ninterest), they remain mere wonderful toys, things quite outside the\npale of the evolution of art, which, I repeat, cannot be carried on\nwithout the architectural sense that connects it with the history of\nmankind To conclude with some general remarks about designing for textiles:\nthe aim should be to combine clearness of form and firmness of\nstructure with the mystery which comes of abundance and richness of\ndetail; and this is easier of attainment in woven goods than in flat\npainted decoration and paper-hangings; because in the former the\nstuffs usually hang in folds and the pattern is broken more or less,\nwhile in the latter it is spread out flat against the wall Do not\nintroduce any lines or objects which cannot be explained by the\nstructure of the pattern; it is just this logical sequence of form, this\ngrowth which looks as if, under the circumstances, it could not have\nbeen otherwise, which prevents the eye wearying of the repetition of\nthe pattern Never introduce any shading for the purpose of making an object look\nround; whatever shading you use should be used for explanation only,\n\n\nto show what you mean by such and such a piece of drawing; and\neven that you had better be sparing of Do not be afraid of large patterns; if properly designed they are more\nrestful to the eye than small ones: on the whole, a pattern where the\nstructure is large and the details much broken up is the most useful Large patterns are not necessarily startling; this comes more of violent\nrelief of the figure from the ground, or inharmonious colouring:\nbeautiful and logical form relieved from the ground by well-managed\ncontrast or gradation, and lying flat on the ground, will never weary\nthe eye Very small rooms, as well as very large ones, look best\nornamented with large patterns, whatever you do with the middling-\nsized ones As final maxims: never forget the material you are working with, and\ntry always to use it for doing what it can do best: if you feel yourself\nhampered by the material in which you are working, instead of being\nhelped by it, you have so far not learned your business, any more than\na would-be poet has, who complains of the hardship of writing in\nmeasure and rhyme The special limitations of the material should be\na pleasure to you, not a hindrance: a designer, therefore, should\nalways \nthoroughly \nunderstand \nthe \nprocesses \nof \nthe \nspecial\nmanufacture he is dealing with, or the result will be a mere tour de\nforce On the other hand, it is the pleasure in understanding the\ncapabilities of a special material, and using them for suggesting (not\nimitating) natural beauty and incident, that gives the raison d'être of\ndecorative art William Morris",
    "William Morris OF DECORATIVE PAINTING AND DESIGN\nThe term Decorative painting implies the existence of painting which\nis not decorative: a strange state of things for an art which primarily\nand pre-eminently appeals to the eye If we look back to the times\nwhen the arts and crafts were in their most flourishing and vigorous\ncondition, and dwelt together, like brethren, in unity—say to the\nfifteenth century—such a distinction did not exist Painting only\ndiffered in its application, and in degree, not in kind In the painting\nof a MS , of the panels of a coffer, of a ceiling, a wall, or an altar-\npiece, the painter was alike—however different his theme and\nconception—possessed with a paramount impulse to decorate, to\nmake the space or surface he dealt with as lovely to the eye in design\nand colour as he had skill to do The art of painting has, however, become considerably differentiated\nsince those days We are here in the nineteenth century encumbered\nwith many distinctions in the art There is obviously much painting\nwhich is not decorative, or ornamental in any sense, which has indeed\nquite other objects It may be the presentment of the more superficial\nnatural facts, phases, or accidents of light; the pictorial dramatising of\nlife or past history; the pointing of a moral; or the embodiment of\nromance and poetic thought or symbol Not but what it is quite\npossible for a painter to deal with such things and yet to produce a\nwork that shall be decorative A picture, of course, may be a piece of decorative art of the most\nbeautiful kind; but to begin with, if it is an easel picture, it is not\nnecessarily related to anything but itself: its painter is not bound to\nconsider anything outside its own dimensions; and, indeed, the\npractice of holding large and mixed picture-shows has taught him the\nuselessness of so doing Then, too, the demand for literal presentment of the superficial facts\nor phases of nature often removes the painter and his picture still\nfarther from the architectural, decorative, and constructive artist and\nthe handicraftsman, who are bound to think of plan, and design, and\nmaterials—of the adaptation of their work, in short—while the\npainter seeks only to be an unbiassed recorder of all accidents and\n\n\nsensational conditions of nature and life,—and so we get our\nillustrated newspapers on a grand scale An illustrated newspaper, however, in spite of the skill and enterprise\nit may absorb, is not somehow a joy for ever; and, after all, if\nliteralism and instantaneous appearances are the only things worth\nstriving for in painting, the photograph beats any painter at that If truth is the object of the modern painter of pictures—truth as\ndistinct from or opposed to beauty—beauty is certainly the object of\nthe decorative painter, but beauty not necessarily severed from truth Without beauty, however, decoration has no reason for existence;\nindeed it can hardly be said to exist Next to beauty, the first essential of a decoration is that it shall be\nrelated to its environment, that it shall express or acknowledge the\nconditions under which it exists If a fresco on a wall, for instance, it\nadorns the wall without attempting to look like a hole cut in it\nthrough which something is accidentally seen; if a painting on a vase,\nit acknowledges the convexity of the shape, and helps to express\ninstead of contradicting it; if on a panel in a cabinet or door, it\nspreads itself in an appropriate filling on an organic plan to cover it;\nbeing, in short, ornamental by its very nature, its first business is to\nornament There exist, therefore, certain definite tests for the work of the\ndecorative artist Does the design fit its place and material Is it in\nscale with its surroundings and in harmony with itself Is it fair and\nlovely in colour Has it beauty and invention Has it thought and\npoetic feeling These are the demands a decorator has to answer, and\nby his answer he must stand or fall; but such questions show that the\nscope of decoration is no mean one It must be acknowledged that a mixed exhibition does not easily\nafford the fairest or completest tests of such qualities An exhibition is\nat best a compromise, a convenience, a means of comparison, and to\nenable work to be shown to the public; but of course is, after all, only\nreally and properly exhibited when it is in the place and position and\nlight for which it was destined The tests by which to judge a\ndesigner's work are only complete then As the stem and branches to the leaves, flowers, and fruit of a tree, so\n\n\nis design to painting In decoration one cannot exist without the other,\nas the beauty of a figure depends upon the well-built and well-\nproportioned skeleton and its mechanism You cannot separate a\nhouse from its plan and foundations",
    "You cannot separate a\nhouse from its plan and foundations So it is in decoration; often\nthought of lightly as something trivial and superficial, a merely\naimless combination of curves and colours, or a mere réchauffé of the\ndead languages of art, but really demanding the best thought and\ncapacity of a man; and in the range of its application it is not less\ncomprehensive The mural painter is not only a painter, but a poet, historian,\ndramatist, philosopher What should we know, how much should we\nrealise, of the ancient world and its life without him, and his brother\nthe architectural sculptor How would ancient Egypt live without her\nwall paintings—or Rome, or Pompeii, or Mediæval Italy How much\nof beauty as well as of history is contained in the illuminated pages of\nthe books of the Middle Ages Some modern essays in mural painting show that the habit of mind\nand method of work fostered by the production of trifles for the\npicture market is not favourable to monumental painting Neither the\nmood nor the skill, indeed, can be grown like a mushroom; such\nworks as the Sistine Chapel, the Stanzi of Raphael, or the Apartimenti\nBorgia, are the result of long practice through many centuries, and\nintimate relationship and harmony in the arts, as well as a certain\nunity of public sentiment The true soil for the growth of the painter in this higher sense is a rich\nand varied external life: familiarity from early youth with the uses of\nmaterials and methods, and the hand facility which comes of close\nand constant acquaintanceship with the tools of the artist, who sums\nup and includes in himself other crafts, such as modelling, carving,\nand the hammering of metal, architectural design, and a knowledge of\nall the ways man has used to beautify and deck the surroundings and\naccessories of life to satisfy his delight in beauty We know that painting was strictly an applied art in its earlier history,\nand all through the Middle Ages painters were in close alliance with\nthe other crafts of design, and their work in one craft no doubt\nreacted on and influenced that in another, while each was kept\ndistinct At all events, painters like Albert Dürer and Holbein were\n\n\nalso masters of design in all ways Through the various arts and crafts of the Greek, Mediæval, or Early\nRenaissance periods, there is evident, from the examples which have\ncome down to us, a certain unity and common character in design,\nasserting itself through all diverse individualities: each art is kept\ndistinct, with a complete recognition of the capacity and advantages\nof its own particular method and purpose In our age, for various reasons (social, commercial, economic), the\nspecialised and purely pictorial painter is dominant His aims and\nmethods influence other arts and crafts, but by no means\nadvantageously as a rule; since, unchecked by judicious ideas of\ndesign, attempts are made in unsuitable materials to produce so-called\nrealistic force, and superficial and accidental appearances dependent\non peculiar qualities of lighting and atmosphere, quite out of place in\nany other method than painting, or in any place but an easel picture From such tendencies, such influences as these, in the matter of\napplied art and design, we are striving to recover One of the first\nresults is, perhaps, this apparently artificial distinction between\ndecorative and other painting But along with this we have painters\nwhose easel pictures are in feeling and treatment quite adaptable as\nwall and panel decorations, and they are painters who, as a rule, have\nstudied other methods in art, and drawn their inspiration from the\nmode of Mediæval or Early Renaissance times Much might be said of different methods and materials of work in\ndecorative painting, but I have hardly space here The decorative\npainter prefers a certain flatness of effect, and therefore such methods\nas fresco, in which the colours are laid on while the plaster ground is\nwet, and tempera naturally appeal to him In the latter the colours\nground in water and used with size, or white and yolk of egg, or\nprepared with starch, worked on a dry ground, drying lighter than\nwhen they are put on, have a peculiar luminous quality, while the\nsurface is free from any gloss Both these methods need direct\npainting and finishing as the work proceeds By a method of working in ordinary oil colours on a ground of fibrous\nplaster, using rectified spirit of turpentine or benzine as a medium,\nmuch of the quality of fresco or tempera may be obtained, with the\nadvantage that the plaster ground may be a movable panel There are, however, other fields for the decorative painter than wall\npainting; as, for instance, domestic furniture, which may vary in\ndegree of elaboration from the highly ornate cassone or marriage\ncoffer of Mediæval Italy to the wreaths and sprays which decked\nchairs and bed-posts even within our century There has been of late\nsome revival of painting as applied chiefly to the panels of cabinets,\nor the decoration of piano fronts and cases",
    "There has been of late\nsome revival of painting as applied chiefly to the panels of cabinets,\nor the decoration of piano fronts and cases The same causes produce the same results With the search after, and\ndesire for, beauty in life, we are again driven to study the laws of\nbeauty in design and painting; and in so doing painters will find again\nthe lost thread, the golden link of connection and intimate association\nwith the sister arts and handicrafts, whereof none is before or after\nanother, none is greater or less than the other Walter Crane Walter Crane OF WALL PAPERS\nWhile the tradition and practice of mural painting as applied to\ninterior walls and ceilings of houses still linger in Italy, in the form of\noften skilful if not always tasteful tempera work, in more western\ncountries, like England, France, and America, under the economic\nconditions and customs of commercial civilisation, with its smoky\ncities, and its houses built by the hundred to one pattern, perhaps,\nand let on short terms, as regards domestic decoration—except in the\ncase of a few wealthy freeholders—mural painting has ceased to exist Its place has been taken by what after all is but a substitute for it,\nnamely, wall paper I am not aware that any specimen of wall paper has been discovered\nthat has claims to any higher antiquity than the sixteenth century, and\nit only came much into use in the last, increasing in the present, until\nit has become well-nigh a universal covering for domestic walls, and\nat the same time has shown a remarkable development in design,\nvarying from very unpretending patterns and printings in one colour\nto elaborate block-printed designs in many colours, besides cheap\nmachine-printed papers, where all the tints are printed from the\ndesign on a roller at once Since Mr William Morris has shown what beauty and character in\npattern, and good and delicate choice of tint can do for us, giving in\nshort a new impulse in design, a great amount of ingenuity and\nenterprise has been spent on wall papers in England, and in the better\nkinds a very distinct advance has been made upon the patterns of\ninconceivable hideousness, often of French origin, of the period of the\nSecond Empire—a period which perhaps represents the most degraded\nlevel of taste in decoration generally The designer of patterns for wall papers heretofore has been content\nto imitate other materials, and adapt the characteristics of the\npatterns found, say, in silk damask hangings or tapestry, or even\nimitate the veining of wood, or marble, or tiles; but since the revival\nof interest in art, the study of its history, and knowledge of style, a\nnew impulse has been given, and patterns are constructed with more\ndirect reference to their beauty, and interest as such, while strictly\n\n\nadapted to the methods of manufacture Great pains are often taken\nby our principal makers to secure good designs and harmonious\ncolourings, and though a manufacturer and director of works is\nalways more or less controlled by the exigencies of the market and the\ndemands of the tentative salesman—considerations which have no\nnatural connection with art, though highly important as economic\nconditions affecting its welfare—very remarkable results have been\nproduced, and a special development of applied design may almost be\nsaid to have come into existence with the modern use of wall papers The manufacture suffers like most others from the keenness and\nunscrupulousness of commercial competition, which leads to the\nproduction of specious imitations of bonâ fide designs, and\nunauthorised use of designs originally intended for other purposes,\nand this of course presses unfairly upon the more conscientious\nmaker, so long as the public do not decline to be deceived English wall papers are made in lengths 21 inches wide French wall\npapers are 18 inches wide This has probably been found most\nconvenient in working in block-printing: it is obvious to any one who\nhas seen the printers at work that a wider block than 21 inches would\nbe unwieldy, since the block is printed by hand, being suspended from\nabove by a cord, and guided by the workman's hand from the well of\ncolour, into which it is dipped, to the paper flat on a table before him The designer must work to the given width, and though his design\nmay vary in depth, must never exceed 21 inches square, except where\ndouble blocks are used His main business is to devise his pattern so\nthat it will repeat satisfactorily over an indefinite wall space without\nrunning into awkward holes or lines It may be easy enough to draw a\nspray or two of leaves or flowers which will stand by themselves, but\nto combine them in an organic pattern which shall repeat pleasantly\nover a wall surface requires much ingenuity and a knowledge of the\nconditions of the manufacture, apart from play of fancy and artistic\nskill One way of concealing the joints of the repeat of the pattern is by\ncontriving what is called a drop-repeat, so that, in hanging, the paper-\nhanger, instead of placing each repeat of pattern side by side, is\nenabled to join the pattern at a point its own depth below, which\nvaries the effect, and arranges the chief features or masses on an\nalternating plan The modern habit of regarding the walls of a room chiefly as a\nbackground to pictures, furniture, or people, and perhaps the\nsmallness of the average room, has brought rather small, thickly\ndispersed, leafy patterns into vogue, retiring in colour for the most\npart While, however, we used to see rotund and accidental bunches\nof roses (the pictorial or sketchy treatment of which contrasted\nawkwardly with their formal repetition), we now get a certain sense\nof adaptation, and the necessity of a certain flatness of treatment; and\nmost of us who have given much thought to the subject feel that when\nnatural forms are dealt with, under such conditions, suggestion is\nbetter than any attempt at realisation, or naturalistic or pictorial\ntreatment, and that a design must be constructed upon some\nsystematic plan, if not absolutely controlled by a geometric basis Wall papers are printed from blocks prepared from designs, the\noutlines of which are reproduced by means of flat brass wire driven\nedgeways into the wood block One block for each tint is used First\none colour is printed on a length of paper, a piece of 12 yards long\nand 21 inches wide, which is passed over sticks suspended across the\nworkshop When the first colour is dry the next is printed, and so on;\nthe colours being mixed with size and put in shallow trays or wells,\ninto which the blocks are dipped A cheaper kind is printed by steam power from rollers on which the\ndesign has been reproduced in the same way by brass wire, which\nholds the colour; but in the case of machine-printed papers all the\ntints are printed at once Thus the pattern is often imperfect and\nblurred A more elaborate and costly kind of wall paper is that which is\nstamped and gilded, in emulation of stamped and gilded leather,\nwhich it resembles in effect and quality of surface For this method\nthe design is reproduced in relief as a repoussée brass plate, and from\nthis a mould or matrix is made, and the paper being damped is\nstamped in a press into the matrix, and so takes the pattern in relief,\nwhich is generally covered with white metal and lacquered to a gold\nhue, and this again may be rubbed in with black, which by filling the\ninterstices gives emphasis to the design and darkens the gold to\nbronze; or the gilded surface may be treated in any variety of colour\nby means of painting or lacquer, or simply relieved by colouring the\nground But few of us own our own walls, or the ground they stand upon: but\nfew of us can afford to employ ourselves or skilled artists and\ncraftsmen in painting our rooms with beautiful fancies: but if we can\nget well-designed repeating patterns by the yard, in agreeable tints,\nwith a pleasant flavour perchance of nature or antiquity, for a few\nshillings or pounds, ought we not to be happy At all events, wall-\npaper makers should naturally think so Walter Crane FICTILES\nEarliest amongst the inventions of man and his endeavour to unite Art\nwith Craft is the Fictile Art His first needs in domestic life, his first\nutensils, his first efforts at civilisation, came from the Mother Earth,\nwhose son he believed himself to be, and his ashes or his bones\nreturned to Earth enshrined in the fictile vases he created from their\ncommon clay And these Fictiles tell the story of his first Art-instincts,\nand of his yearnings to unite beauty with use They tell, too, more of\nhis history than is enshrined and preserved by any other art; for\nalmost all we know of many a people and many a tongue is learned\nfrom the fictile record, the sole relic of past civilisations which the\nDestroyer Time has left us Begun in the simplest fashion, fashioned by the simplest means,\ncreated from the commonest materials, Fictile Art grew with man's\nintellectual growth, and Fictile Craft grew with his knowledge; the\nlatter conquering, in this our day, when the craftsman strangles the\nartist alike in this as in all other arts To truly foster and forward the\nart, the craftsman and the artist should, where possible, be united, or\nat least should work in common, as was the case when, in each\ncivilisation, the Potter's Art flourished most, and when the scientific\nbase was of less account than was the art employed upon it In its\nearliest stages the local clay sufficed for the formative portion of the\nwork, and the faiences of most European countries offer more artistic\nresults to us than do the more scientifically compounded porcelains In the former case the native clay seemed more easily to ally itself\nwith native art, to record more of current history, to create artistic\ngenius rather than to be content with attempting to copy\nmisunderstood efforts of other peoples and other times But when\nscience ransacked the earth for foreign bodies and ingredients, foreign\ndecorative ideas came with them and Fictile Art was no more a\nvernacular one It attempted to disguise itself, to show the craftsman\nsuperior to the artist; and then came the Manufacturer and the reign\nof quantity over quality, the casting in moulds by the gross and the\nprinting by the thousands Be it understood these remarks only apply\nto the introduction of porcelain into Europe In the East where the\nclay is native, the art is native; the potter's hand and the wheel yet\n\n\nmaintain the power of giving the potter his individuality as the\ncreator and the artist, and save him from being but the servant and\nthe slave of a machine Between faience and porcelain comes, midway, Stoneware, in which\nmany wonderfully, and some fearfully, made things have been done of\nlate, but which possesses the combined qualities of faience and\nporcelain—the ease of manipulation of the former, and the hardness\nand durability of the latter; but the tendency to over-elaborate the\ndetail of its decoration, and rely less on the beauty of its semi-glossy\nsurface than on meretricious ornament, has rather spoiled a very\nhopeful movement in Ceramic Art Probably the wisest course to\npursue at the present would be to pay more attention to faiences\ndecorated with simple glazes or with \"slip\" decoration, and this\nespecially in modelled work A continuation of the artistic career of\nthe Della Robbia family is yet an unfulfilled desideratum,\nnotwithstanding that glazed faiences have never since their time\nceased to be made, and that glazed figure work of large scale\nprevailed in the eighteenth century Unglazed terra cotta, an artistic\nproduct eminently suited to our climate and to our urban architecture,\nhas but partially developed itself, and this more in the direction of\nmoulded and cast work than that of really plastic art; and albeit that\nfrom its dawn to this present the Fictile Art has been exercised\nabundantly, its rôle is by no means exhausted The artist and the\ncraftsman have yet a wide field before them, but it would be well that\nthe former should, for some while to come, take the lead Science has\ntoo long reigned supreme in a domain wherein she should have been\nnot more than equal sovereign She has had her triumphs, great\ntriumphs too, triumphs which have been fraught with good in an\nutilitarian sense, but she has tyrannised too rigidly over the realm of\nArt Let us now try to equalise the dual rule G T Robinson",
    "Robinson METAL WORK\nIn discussing the artistic aspect of metal work, we have to take into\naccount the physical properties and appropriate treatment of the\nfollowing metals: the precious metals, gold and silver; copper, both\npure and alloyed with other metals, especially tin and zinc in various\nproportions to form the many kinds of brass and bronze; lead, with a\ngroup of alloys of which pewter is typical; and iron, in the three forms\nof cast iron, wrought iron, and steel All these have been made to\nserve the purpose of the artist, and the manipulation of them, while\npresenting many differences in detail, presents certain broad\ncharacteristics in common which distinguish them from the raw\nmaterial of other crafts Whether they are found native in the metallic\nstate as is usual in the case of gold, or combined with many other\nminerals in the form of ore as is more common with other metals, fire\nis the primal agency by which they are made available for our needs The first stage in their manipulation is to melt and cast them into\ningots of a size convenient to the purpose intended Secondly, all\nthese metals when pure, and many alloys, are in varying degree\nmalleable and ductile, are, in fact, if sufficient force be applied,\nplastic Hence arises the first broad division in the treatment of\nmetals The fluid metal may, by the use of suitable moulds, be cast at\nonce to the shape required, or the casting may be treated merely as\nthe starting-point for a whole series of operations—forging, rolling,\nchipping, chasing, wire-drawing, and many more Another property of\nthe metals which must be noticed is, that not only can separate\nmasses of metals be melted down and fused into one, but it is\npossible, under various conditions, of which the one invariably\nnecessary is perfectly clean surfaces of contact, to unite separate\nportions of the same or different metals without fusion of the mass For our present purpose the most important instance of this is the\nprocess of soldering, by which two surfaces are united by the\napplication of sufficient heat to melt more fusible metal which is\nintroduced between them, and which combines with both so as firmly\nto unite them on solidifying Closely allied to this are the processes by\nwhich one metal is, for purposes of adornment or preservation from\ncorrosion, coated with a thin film or deposit of another, usually more\ncostly, metal Though hereafter electro-metallurgy may assert its claim to artistic\noriginality as a third division, for the present all metal work, so far as\nits artistic aspect depends upon process, falls naturally into one of the\ntwo broad divisions of cast metal and wrought metal Both have been\nemployed from a time long anterior to written history; ornaments of\nbeaten gold, and tools of cast bronze, are alike found among the relics\nof very early stages of civilisation, and in early stages both alike are\nartistic The choice between the two processes is determined by such\nconsiderations as convenience of manufacture and the physical\nproperties of the metals, and the different purposes in view When a\nthick and comparatively massive shape is required, it is often easier to\ncast it at once For thinner and lighter forms it is usually more\nconvenient to treat the ingot or crude product of the furnace as mere\nraw material for a long series of workings under the hammer, or its\npatent mechanical equivalents, the rolling and pressing mills of\nmodern mechanics The choice is further influenced by the toughness\ngenerally characteristic of wrought metal, whereas the alloys which\nyield the cleanest castings are by no means universally the best in\nother respects Iron is the extreme instance of this: ordinary cast iron\nbeing an impure form of the metal, which is too brittle to be worked\nunder the hammer, but is readily cast into moulds, being fluid at a\ntemperature which, though high, is easily obtained in a blast furnace Wrought iron, however, which is usually obtained from cast iron by a\nprocess called puddling, whereby the impurities are burnt out, does\nnot become fluid enough to pour into moulds; but on the other hand,\npieces at a white heat can be united into a solid mass by skilful\nhammering, a process which is called welding, and, together with the\nfact that from its great hardness it is usually worked hot, is specially\ndistinctive of the blacksmith's craft In no other metal is the separation\nbetween the two branches so wide as in iron The misdirected skill of\nsome modern iron-founders has caused the name of cast iron to be\nregarded as the very negative of art, and has even thrown suspicion\non the process of casting itself as one of questionable honesty Nevertheless, as a craft capable of giving final shape to metal, it has\nmanifestly an artistic aspect, and, in fact, bronze statuary, a fine art\npure and simple, is reproduced from the clay model merely by\nmoulding and casting We must therefore look for the artistic\nconditions in the preparation of the model or pattern, the impress of\nwhich in sand or loam forms the mould; the pattern may be carved in\nwood or modelled in clay, but the handling of the wood or clay is\n\n\nmodified by the conditions under which the form is reproduced And\nlastly, the finished object may either retain the surface formed as the\nmetal solidifies, as in the case of the bronzes cast by the wax process,\nor the skin may be removed by the use of cutting tools, chisels and\nfiles and gravers, so that, as in the case of many of the better French\nbronzes, the finished work is strictly carved work On the contrary,\nmuch silversmith's work, as well as such simple objects as Chinese\ngongs and Indian \"lotahs,\" after being cast approximately to shape are\nfinished by hammer work, that is, treated as plastic material with\ntools that force the material into shape instead of cutting the shape\nout of the mass by removing exterior portions of material Attempts to\nimitate both processes by casting only, thus dispensing with the cost\nof finishing, are common, but as they dispense likewise with all\nbeauty in the product, even if they do not substitute varnished and\ntinted zinc for better metal, their success is commercial only We have thus three characteristic kinds of surface resulting from the\nconditions of treatment, marking out three natural divisions of the art:\nand be it noted that questions of surface or texture are all-important\nin the arts; beauty is skin deep First, the natural skin of the metal\nsolidified in contact with the mould, and more or less closely imitative\nof the surface of the original model, usually for our purposes a plastic\nsurface; secondly, there is carved, technically called chased, work; and\nthirdly, beaten or wrought work, which in ornament is termed\nembossing Superimposed on these we have the cross divisions of the crafts\naccording to the special metal operated on, and in the existing\nindustrial organisation the groups thus obtained have to be further\ndivided into many sub-heads, according to the articles produced; and\nfinally, another commercial distinction has to be drawn which greatly\naffects the present condition of handicraft, that is, the division of the\nseveral trades into craftsmen and salesmen There can be no doubt\nthat the extent of the existing dissociation of the producing craftsman\nfrom the consumer is an evil for the arts, and that the growing\npreponderance of great stores is inimical to excellence of\nworkmanship It is, perhaps, an advantage for the workman to be\nrelieved from the office of salesman; the position of the village smith\nplying his calling in face of his customers might not suit every craft,\nbut the services of the middleman are dearly bought at the price of\nartistic freedom It is too often in the power of the middleman to\n\n\ndictate the quality of workmanship, too often his seeming interest to\nordain that it shall be bad The choice of a metal for any particular purpose is determined by\nphysical properties combined with considerations of cost Iron, if only\nfor its cheapness, is the material for the largest works of metal; while\nin the form of steel it is the best available material for many very\nsmall works, watch-springs for instance: it has the defect of liability to\nrust; the surfaces of other metals may tarnish, but iron rusts through For the present only one application of cast iron concerns us—its use\nfor grates and stoves The point to remember is, that as the material\nhas but little beauty, its employment should be restricted to the\nquantity prescribed by the demands of utility Wrought iron, on the\ncontrary, gives very great scope to the artist, and it offers this peculiar\nadvantage, that the necessity of striking while the iron is hot enforces\nsuch free dexterity of handling in the ordinary smith, that he has\ncomparatively little to learn if set to produce ornamental work, and\nthus renewed interest in the art has found craftsmen enough who\ncould readily respond to the demand made upon them Copper, distinguished among metals by its glowing red tint, has as a\nmaterial for artistic work been overshadowed by its alloys, brass and\nbronze; partly because they make sounder castings, partly it is to be\nfeared from the approach of their colour to gold Holding an\nintermediate position between iron and the precious metals, they are\nthe material of innumerable household utensils and smaller\narchitectural fittings Lead, tin, and zinc scarcely concern the artist to-day, though neither\nplumber nor pewterer has always been restricted to plain\nutilitarianism Gold and silver have been distinguished in all ages as\nthe precious metals, both for their comparative rarity and their\nfreedom from corrosion, and their extreme beauty They are both\nextremely malleable and very readily worked Unhappily there is little\noriginal English work being done in these metals The more ordinary\nwares have all life and feeling taken out of them by mechanical finish,\nan abrasive process being employed to remove every sign of tool-\nmarks The all-important surface is thus obliterated",
    "The all-important surface is thus obliterated As to design,\nfashion oscillates between copies of one past period and another A\ncomparison of one of these copies with an original will make the\ndistinction between the work of a man paid to do his quickest and one\n\n\npaid to do his best clearer than volumes of description Indeed, when\nall is said, a writer can but indicate the logic that underlies the craft,\nor hint at the relation which subsists between the process, the\nmaterial, and the finished ware: the distinction between good and bad\nin art eludes definition; it is not an affair of reason, but of perception W A S Benson STONE AND WOOD CARVING\nThe crafts of the stone and wood carver may fairly be taken in review\nat the same time, although they differ in themselves It is a misfortune that there should be so great a gulf as there is\nbetween the craftsman who is called, and considers himself to be\nproperly called, \"a sculptor\" and his fellow-craftsman who is called \"a\ncarver \" In these days the \"sculptor\" is but too often a man who would\nthink it a condescension to execute what, for want of a better name,\nwe must call decorative work In truth, the sculptor is the outcome of\nthat entire separation which has come about between the love of\nbeauty, once common in everyday life, and art, as it is now called—a\nthing degraded to the purposes of a toy, a mere ornament for the rich The sculptor is trained to make these ornaments, things which have\nno relation to their surroundings, but which may be placed now in a\ndrawing-room, now in a conservatory or a public square, alone and\nunsheltered He is a child of the studio The result of this training is, he has lost all knowledge how to produce\nwork of a decorative character He understands nothing of design in a\nwide sense, but being able to model a figure with tolerable success he\nrests therewith content Being designed, as it is, in the studio, his\nwork is wanting in sympathy with its surroundings; it does not fall\ninto its place, it is not a part of a complete conception Things were not so when sculpture and what, for want of a better\nterm, we have called \"stone and wood carving\" were at their prime The Greek craftsman could produce both the great figure of the god,\nwhich stood alone as the central object in the temple, and (working in\nthorough sympathy with the architect) the decorative sculpture of less\nimportance which was attached to the building round about, and\nwithout which the beauty of the fabric was incomplete So also the great Florentine sculptors spent themselves with equal zeal\non a door, the enclosure of a choir, a pulpit, or a tomb, which in those\ndays meant not merely the effigy of the departed, but a complete\ndesign of many parts all full of beauty and skill In the great days of Mediæval Art sculpture played a part of the\nhighest importance The works then produced are not only excellent\nin themselves, but are so designed as to form a part of the building\nthey adorn How thoroughly unfinished would be the west front of the\nCathedral at Wells, or the portals of Amiens or Reims, without their\nsculpture How rarely can we feel this sense of satisfaction, of unity of result,\nbetween the work of the sculptor and the architect in our buildings of\nto-day The figures are \"stood about\" like ornaments on the\nmantelpiece The architect seems as unable to prepare for them as the\nsculptor to make them We seldom see congruity even between the\nfigure and the pedestal on which it stands The want of this extended sympathy leads to another ill result",
    "The want of this extended sympathy leads to another ill result Wood,\nstone, and metal, different as they are, are treated by the artist in\nmuch the same fashion The original model in clay seems to stand\nbehind everything The \"artist\" makes the clay model; his subordinates\nwork it out in one or another material The result can only be\nunsatisfactory because the natural limitations fixed by the qualities of\nthe different materials have been neglected, whereas they should\nstand forth prominently in the mind of the artist from the moment he\nfirst conceives his design Marble, stones—some hard, some soft,—terra cotta, metals, or wood,\neach demand a difference of treatment For example, the fibrous\nnature of wood enables the craftsman to produce work which would\nfall to pieces at the first blow if executed in stone The polished and\nvaried surface of marble demands a treatment of surface and section\nof mouldings which in stone would seem tame and poor Again, it\nmust not be forgotten that most works in stone or marble are built up They are composed of many blocks standing one on the other With\nwood it is quite different Used in thick pieces it splits; good wood-\nwork is therefore framed together, the framing and intermediate\npanelling lending itself to the richest decoration; but anything in the\ndesign which suggests stone construction is obviously wrong In short,\nwood must be treated as a material that is fibrous and tenacious, and\nin planks or slabs; stone or marble as of close, even texture, brittle\nand in blocks Consequent on these differences of texture, we find that the tools and\n\n\nmethod of handling them used by the wood-carver differ in many\nrespects from those used by the worker in stone or marble One\nmaterial is scooped and cut out, the other is attacked by a constant\nrepetition of blows In the history of Mediæval Art we find that the craft of the stone-\ncarver was perfectly understood long before that of his brother\ncraftsman in wood Whilst the first had all through Europe attained\ngreat perfection in the thirteenth century, the second did not reach\nthe same standard till the fifteenth, and with the classic revival it died\nout Nothing displays more fully the adaptation of design and\ndecoration to the material than much of the fifteenth-century stall-\nwork in our English cathedrals These could only be executed in\nwood; the design is suited to that material only; but when the Italian\ninfluence creeps in, the designs adopted are in fact suited to fine\nstone, marble, or alabaster, and not to wood Until the craftsman in stone and wood is more of an architect, and the\narchitect more of a craftsman, we cannot hope for improvement Somers Clarke FURNITURE\nThe institution of schools of art and design, and the efforts of serials\nand magazines devoted to artistic matters, have had their proper\neffect in the creation of a pretty general distaste for the clumsy and\ninartistic forms which characterised cabinets and furniture generally\nsome \nyears \nback Unfortunately \nfor \nthe \nmovement, \nsome\nmanufacturers saw their opportunity in the demand thus created for\nbetter and more artistic shapes to produce bad and ill-made copies of\ngood designs, which undermined the self-respect of the unfortunate\nman (frequently a good and sufficient craftsman) whose ill hap it was\nto be obliged to make them, and vexed the soul of the equally\nunfortunate purchaser The introduction of machinery for moulding, which left only the\nfitting and polishing to be done by the craftsman, and which enabled\nmanufacturers to produce two or three cabinets in the time formerly\noccupied in the making of one, was all against the quality and\nstability of the work No good work was ever done in a hurry: the\ncraftsman may be rapid, but his rapidity is the result of very\ndeliberate thought, and not of hurry Good furniture, however, cannot\nbe made rapidly All wood, no matter how long it is kept, nor how dry\nit may be superficially, will always shrink again when cut into It follows that the longer the interval between the cutting up of the\nwood, and its fitting together, the better for the work In the old times\nthe parts of a cabinet lay about in the workman's benchway for weeks,\nand even months, and were continually turned over and handled by\nhim while he was engaged on the mouldings and other details The\nwood thus became really dry, and no further shrinkage could take\nplace after it was put together A word here about the designing of cabinets Modern furniture designers are far too much influenced by\nconsiderations of style, and sacrifice a good deal that is valuable in\norder to conform to certain rules which, though sound enough in their\nrelation to architecture, do not really apply to furniture at all Much\nmore pleasing, and not necessarily less artistic work would be\nproduced, were designers, and handicraftsmen too, encouraged to\n\n\nallow their imagination more scope, and to get more of their own\nindividuality into their work, instead of being the slaves of styles\ninvented by people who lived under quite different conditions from\nthose now prevailing Mouldings as applied to cabinets are nearly always too coarse, and\nproject too much This applies equally to the carvings, which should\nalways be quite subordinate to the general design and mouldings, and\n(in its application to surfaces) should be in low relief This is quite\ncompatible with all necessary vigour as well as refinement The idea\nthat boldness—viz high projection of parts in carving—has anything\nto do with vigour is a common one, but is quite erroneous All the\npower and vigour which he is capable of putting into anything, the\nclever carver can put into a piece of ornament which shall not project\nmore than a quarter of an inch from the ground in any part Indeed, I\nhave known good carvers who did their best work within those limits Knowledge of line, of the management of planes, with dexterity in the\nhandling of surfaces, is all he requires Another common mistake is to\nsuppose that smoothness of surface has anything to do with finish\nproperly so called If only half the time which is commonly spent in\nsmoothing and polishing carved surfaces was devoted to the more\nthorough study and development of the various parts of the design,\nand the correction of the outlines, the surface might very well be left\nto take care of itself, and the work would be the better for it There is not space in this paper to do more than glance at a few other\nmethods in ordinary use for cabinet decoration Marquetry, inlays of\nivory, and various other materials have always been extensively used,\nand sometimes with excellent effect In many old examples the surface\nof the solid wood was cut away to the pattern, and various other\nkinds of wood pressed into the lines so sunk The method more\ngenerally adopted now is to insert the pattern into veneer which has\nbeen prepared to receive it, and mount the whole on a solid panel or\nshape with glue The besetting sin of the modern designer or maker of marquetry is a\ntendency to \"loud\" colour and violent contrasts of both colour and\ngrain It is common to see as many as a dozen different kinds of wood\nused in the decoration of a modern cabinet—some of them stained\nwoods, and the colours of no two of them in harmony The best work in this kind depends for its effect on a rich, though it\nmay be low tone of colour It is seldom that more than two or three\ndifferent kinds of wood are used, but each kind is so carefully selected\nfor the purpose of the design, and is used in so many different ways,\nthat, while the all-important \"tone\" is kept throughout, the variety of\nsurface is almost infinite For this reason, though it is not necessary\nthat the designer should actually cut the work himself, it is most\nessential that he should always be within call of the cutter, and should\nhimself select every piece of wood which is introduced into the\ndesign This kind of work is sometimes shaded with hot sand; at other\ntimes a darker wood is introduced into the pattern for the shadows The latter is the better way; the former is the cheaper The polishing of cabinet work I have so strong an objection in this\nconnection to the French polisher and all his works and ways, that,\nnotwithstanding the popular prejudice in favour of brilliant surfaces, I\nwould have none of him Formerly the cabinetmaker was accustomed\nto polish his own work, sometimes by exposing the finished surfaces\nto the light for a few weeks in order to darken them, and then\napplying beeswax with plentiful rubbing This was the earliest and the\nbest method, but in later times a polish composed of naphtha and\nshellac was used The latter polish, though open to many of the\nobjections which may be urged against that now in use, was at least\nhard and lasting, which can hardly be said of its modern substitute The action of the more reputable cabinetmaking firms has been, of\nlate, almost wholly in the direction of better design and construction;\nbut a still better guarantee of progress in the future of the craft is\nfound in the fact that the craftsman who takes an artistic and\nintelligent, and not a merely mechanical interest in his work, is now\noften to be met To such men greater individual freedom is alone\nwanting Stephen Webb STAINED GLASS\nIn these days there is a tendency to judge the merits of stained glass\nfrom the standpoint of the archæologist It is good or bad in so far as\nit is directly imitative of work of the fourteenth or fifteenth century The art had reached to a surprising degree of beauty and perfection in\nthe fifteenth century, and although under the influence of the\nRenaissance some good work was done, it rapidly declined only to lift\nits head once more with the revived study of the architecture of the\nMiddle Ages The burning energy of Pugin, which nothing could escape, was\ndirected towards this end, but the attainment of a mere archæological\ncorrectness was the chief aim in view The crude draughtsmanship of\nthe ancient craftsman was diligently imitated, but the spirit and\ncharm of the original was lost, as, in a mere imitation, it must be In\nthe revival of the art, whilst there was an attempt to imitate the\ndrawing, there was no attempt to reproduce the quality of the ancient\nglass Thus, brilliant, transparent, and unbroken tints were used,\nlacking all the richness and splendour of colour so characteristic of\nthe originals Under these conditions of blind imitation the modern\nworker in stained glass produced things probably more hideous than\nthe world ever saw before Departing altogether from the traditions of the mediæval schools,\nwhether ancient or modern, there has arisen another school which has\nfound its chief exponents at Munich",
    "Departing altogether from the traditions of the mediæval schools,\nwhether ancient or modern, there has arisen another school which has\nfound its chief exponents at Munich The object of these people has\nbeen, ignoring the condition under which they must necessarily work,\nto produce an ordinary picture in enamelled colours upon sheets of\nglass The result has been the production of mere transparencies no\nbetter than painted blinds What then, it may be asked, are the limiting conditions, imposed upon\nhim by the nature of the materials, within which the craftsman must\nwork to produce a satisfactory result In the first place, a stained glass window is not an easel picture It\ndoes not stand within a frame, as does the easel picture, in isolation\nfrom the objects surrounding it; it is not even an object to be looked\nat by itself; its duty is, not only to be beautiful, but to play its part in\n\n\nthe adornment of the building in which it is placed, being\nsubordinated to the effect the interior is intended to produce as a\nwhole It is, in fact, but one of many parts that go to produce a\ncomplete result A visit to one of our mediæval churches, such as York\nMinster, Gloucester Cathedral, or Malvern Priory, church buildings,\nwhich still retain much of their ancient glass, and a comparison of the\nunity of effect there experienced with the internecine struggle\nexhibited in most buildings furnished by the glass painters of to-day,\nwill surely convince the most indifferent that there is yet much to be\nlearned Secondly, the great difference between coloured glass and painted\nglass must be kept in view A coloured glass window is in the nature\nof a mosaic Not only are no large pieces of glass used, but each piece\nis separated from and at the same time joined to its neighbour by a\nthin grooved strip of lead which holds the two \"Coloured glass is\nobtained by a mixture of metallic oxides whilst in a state of fusion This colouring pervades the substance of the glass and becomes\nincorporated with it \"[1] It is termed \"pot-metal \" An examination of\nsuch a piece of glass will show it to be full of varieties of a given\ncolour, uneven in thickness, full of little air-bubbles and other\naccidents which cause the rays of light to play in and through it with\nendless variety of effect It is the exact opposite to the clear sheet of\nordinary window-glass To build up a decorative work (and such a form of expression may be\nfound very appropriate in this craft) in coloured glass, the pieces must\nbe carefully selected, the gradations of tint in a given piece being\nmade use of to gain the result aimed at The leaded \"canes\" by which\nthe whole is held together are made use of to aid the effect Fine lines\nand hatchings are painted as with \"silver stain,\" and in this respect\nonly is there any approach to enamelling in the making of a coloured\nglass window The glass mosaic as above described is held in its place\nin the window by horizontal iron bars, and the position of these is a\nmatter of some importance, and is by no means overlooked by the\nartist in considering the effect of his finished work A well-designed\ncoloured glass window is, in fact, like nothing else in the world but\nitself It is not only a mosaic; it is not merely a picture It is the honest\noutcome of the use of glass for making a beautiful window which\nshall transmit light and not look like anything but what it is The\neffect of the work is obtained by the contrast of the rich colours of the\n\n\npot-metal with the pearly tones of the clear glass We must now describe a painted window, so that the distinction\nbetween a coloured and a painted window may be clearly made out Quoting from the same book as before—\"To paint glass the artist uses\na plate of translucent glass, and applies the design and colouring with\nvitrifiable colours These colours, true enamels, are the product of\nmetallic oxides combined with vitreous compounds called fluxes Through the medium of these, assisted by a strong heat, the colouring\nmatters are fixed upon the plate of glass \" In the painted window we\nare invited to forget that glass is being used Shadows are obtained by\nloading the surface with enamel colours; the fullest rotundity of\nmodelling is aimed at; the lead and iron so essentially necessary to the\nconstruction and safety of the window are concealed with\nextraordinary skill and ingenuity The spectator perceives a hole in\nthe wall with a very indifferent picture in it—overdone in the high\nlights, smoky and unpleasant in the shadows, in no sense decorative We need concern ourselves no more with painted windows; they are\nthoroughly false and unworthy of consideration Of coloured or stained windows, as they are more commonly called,\nmany are made, mostly bad, but there are amongst us a few who\nknow how to make them well, and these are better than any made\nelsewhere in Europe at this time Somers Clarke FOOTNOTES:\n[1] Industrial Arts, \"Historical Sketches,\" p 195, published for\nthe Committee of Council on Education",
    "195, published for\nthe Committee of Council on Education Chapman and Hall TABLE GLASS\nFew materials lend themselves more readily to the skill of the\ncraftsman than glass The fluid or viscous condition of the \"metal\" as it\ncomes from the \"pot,\" the way in which it is shaped by the breath of\nthe craftsman, and by his skill in making use of centrifugal force,\nthese and many other things too numerous to mention are all\nmanifested in the triumphs of the Venetian glass-blower At the first\nglance we see that the vessel he has made is of a material once liquid He takes the fullest advantage of the conditions under which he\nworks, and the result is a beautiful thing which can be produced in\nbut one way For many centuries the old methods were followed, but with the\npower to produce the \"metal,\" or glass of extreme purity and\ntransparency, came the desire to leave the old paths, and produce\nwork in imitation of crystal The wheel came into play, and cut and\nengraved glass became general At first there was nothing but a\ngenuine advance or variation on the old modes The specimens of clear glass made at the end of the seventeenth and\nbeginning of the eighteenth centuries are well designed to suit the\ncapabilities of the material The form given to the liquid metal by the\ncraftsman's skill is still manifest, its delicate transparency accentuated\nhere and there by cutting the surface into small facets, or engraving\nupon it graceful designs; but as skill increased so taste degraded The\ngraceful outlines and natural curves of the old workers gave place to\ndistortions of line but too common in all decorative works of the\nperiod A little later and the material was produced in mere lumps,\ncut and tormented into a thousand surfaces, suggesting that the work\nwas made from the solid, as, in part, it was This miserable stuff\nreached its climax in the early years of the present reign Since then a great reaction has taken place For example, the old\ndecanter, a massive lump of misshapen material better suited to the\npurpose of braining a burglar than decorating a table, has given place\nto a light and gracefully formed vessel, covered in many cases with\nwell-designed surface engraving, and thoroughly suited both to the\nuses it is intended to fulfil and the material of which it is made And\n\n\nnot only so, but a distinct variation and development upon the old\ntypes has been made The works produced have not been merely\ncopies, but they have their own character It is not necessary to\ndescribe the craft of the glass-blower It is sufficient to say that he\ndeals with a material which, when it comes to his hands, is a liquid,\nsolidifying rapidly on exposure to the air; that there is hardly a limit\nto the delicacy of the film that can be made; and, in addition to using\na material of one colour, different colours can be laid one over the\nother, the outer ones being afterwards cut through by the wheel,\nleaving a pattern in one colour on a ground of another There has developed itself of late an unfortunate tendency to stray\nfrom the path of improvement,[1] but a due consideration on the part\nboth of the purchaser and of the craftsman of how the material should\nbe used will result, it may be hoped, in farther advances on the right\nroad Somers Clarke FOOTNOTES:\n[1] Novelty rather than improvement is the rock on which our\ncraftsmen are but too often wrecked PRINTING\nPrinting, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned,\ndiffers from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the\nExhibition in being comparatively modern For although the Chinese\ntook impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries\nbefore the wood-cutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process,\nproduced the block books, which were the immediate predecessors of\nthe true printed book, the invention of movable metal letters in the\nmiddle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the\ninvention of the art of printing And it is worth mention in passing\nthat, as an example of fine typography, the earliest book printed with\nmovable types, the Gutenberg, or \"forty-two line Bible\" of about 1455,\nhas never been surpassed Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of\nmaking books by means of movable types Now, as all books not\nprimarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types\ncomposed to form letterpress, it is of the first importance that the\nletter used should be fine in form; especially as no more time is\noccupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful\nletters than in the same operations with ugly ones And it was a\nmatter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took\ncare that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions\nwhatever they were, the forms of printed letters should be beautiful,\nand that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a\nhelp to the shapeliness of the letters themselves The Middle Ages\nbrought caligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore that the\nforms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the\nwritten character, and they followed them very closely The first\nbooks were printed in black letter, i e",
    "e the letter which was a Gothic\ndevelopment of the ancient Roman character, and which developed\nmore completely and satisfactorily on the side of the \"lower-case\" than\nthe capital letters; the \"lower-case\" being in fact invented in the early\nMiddle Ages The earliest book printed with movable type, the\naforesaid Gutenberg Bible, is printed in letters which are an exact\nimitation of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at\nthat time; this has since been called \"missal type,\" and was in fact the\nkind of letter used in the many splendid missals, psalters, etc ,\n\n\nproduced by printing in the fifteenth century But the first Bible\nactually dated (which also was printed at Maintz by Peter Schœffer in\nthe year 1462) imitates a much freer hand, simpler, rounder, and less\nspiky, and therefore far pleasanter and easier to read On the whole\nthe type of this book may be considered the ne-plus-ultra of Gothic\ntype, especially as regards the lower-case letters; and type very similar\nwas used during the next fifteen or twenty years not only by Schœffer,\nbut by printers in Strasburg, Basle, Paris, Lubeck, and other cities But\nthough on the whole, except in Italy, Gothic letter was most often\nused, a very few years saw the birth of Roman character not only in\nItaly, but in Germany and France In 1465 Sweynheim and Pannartz\nbegan printing in the monastery of Subiaco near Rome, and used an\nexceedingly beautiful type, which is indeed to look at a transition\nbetween Gothic and Roman, but which must certainly have come\nfrom the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century MSS They\nprinted very few books in this type, three only; but in their very first\nbooks in Rome, beginning with the year 1468, they discarded this for\na more completely Roman and far less beautiful letter But about the\nsame year Mentelin at Strasburg began to print in a type which is\ndistinctly Roman; and the next year Gunther Zeiner at Augsburg\nfollowed suit; while in 1470 at Paris Udalric Gering and his associates\nturned out the first books printed in France, also in Roman character The Roman type of all these printers is similar in character, and is\nvery simple and legible, and unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by\nno means without beauty It must be said that it is in no way like the\ntransition type of Subiaco, and though more Roman than that, yet\nscarcely more like the complete Roman type of the earliest printers of\nRome A further development of the Roman letter took place at Venice John\nof Spires and his brother Vindelin, followed by Nicholas Jenson,\nbegan to print in that city, 1469, 1470; their type is on the lines of the\nGerman and French rather than of the Roman printers Of Jenson it\nmust be said that he carried the development of Roman type as far as\nit can go: his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least as\nbeautiful as any other Roman type After his death in the \"fourteen\neighties,\" or at least by 1490, printing in Venice had declined very\nmuch; and though the famous family of Aldus restored its technical\nexcellence, rejecting battered letters, and paying great attention to the\n\"press work\" or actual process of printing, yet their type is artistically\n\n\non a much lower level than Jenson's, and in fact they must be\nconsidered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,\nsome of which—as, e",
    "Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,\nsome of which—as, e g , that of Jacobus Rubeus or Jacques le Rouge—\nis scarcely distinguishable from his It was these great Venetian\nprinters, together with their brethren of Rome, Milan, Parma, and one\nor two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the\nClassics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art, and are\nworthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived\nlearning of that epoch By far the greater part of these Italian printers,\nit should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under\nthe influence of Italian opinion and aims It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the\nfirst quarter of the sixteenth centuries the Roman letter was used side\nby side with the Gothic Even in Italy most of the theological and law\nbooks were printed in Gothic letter, which was generally more\nformally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen, many of\nwhose types, indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a\ntransitional character This was notably the case with the early works\nprinted at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg In fact\nGunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is\nremarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed\nbooks, Gothic was the favourite The characteristic Dutch type, as\nrepresented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced\nand uncompromising Gothic This type was introduced into England\nby Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor, and was used there with\nvery little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, and indeed into the eighteenth Most of Caxton's own types\nare of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish\nor Cologne letter After the end of the fifteenth century the\ndegradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy, went on\napace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really\nbeautiful printing done: the best, mostly French or Low-Country, was\nneat and clear, but without any distinction; the worst, which perhaps\nwas the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier\npresses; and things got worse and worse through the whole of the\nseventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very\n\n\nmiserably performed In England about this time, an attempt was\nmade (notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-\nfounder in 1720) to improve the letter in form Caslon's type is clear\nand neat, and fairly well designed; he seems to have taken the letter\nof the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model: type cast\nfrom his matrices is still in everyday use In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one\nlast degradation to undergo The seventeenth century founts were bad\nrather negatively than positively But for the beauty of the earlier\nwork they might have seemed tolerable It was reserved for the\nfounders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are\npositively ugly, and which, it may be added, are dazzling and\nunpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar\nthinning of the lines: for the seventeenth-century letters are at least\npure and simple in line The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman,\nDidot, were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own\nBaskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on\nthe same lines; but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not\nnearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the\nFrenchman With this change the art of printing touched bottom, so far as fine\nprinting is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about\n1840 The Chiswick press in 1844 revived Caslon's founts, printing for\nMessrs Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby This experiment was\nso far successful that about 1850 Messrs Miller and Richard of\nEdinburgh were induced to cut punches for a series of \"old style\"\nletters These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,\nhave now come into general use and are obviously a great\nimprovement on the ordinary \"modern style\" in use in England, which\nis in fact the Bodoni type a little reduced in ugliness The design of the\nletters of this modern \"old style\" leaves a good deal to be desired, and\nthe whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the\nletters It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is\ndone by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press, and\nthese somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process,\nwhich would not do justice to letters of more generous design It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years\nis almost wholly confined to Great Britain Here and there a book is\n\n\nprinted in France or Germany with some pretension to good taste, but\nthe general revival of the old forms has made no way in those\ncountries Italy is contentedly stagnant America has produced a good\nmany showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of which\nare, however, all wrong, oddity rather than rational beauty and\nmeaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and\nthe illustrations To say a few words on the principles of design in typography: it is\nobvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of\nthe letters; this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational\nswellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of\nline Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in\nthis respect: the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are\nhooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way, instead of ending in the\nsharp and clear stroke of Jenson's letters; there is a grossness in the\nupper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on, an ugly pear-\nshaped swelling defacing the form of the letter: in short, it happens to\nthis craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes\nto avoid ornament, still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood\nconventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no\nmeans useful; which title can only be claimed by artistic practice,\nwhether the art in it be conscious or unconscious In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar\nillegibility of the modern type and the elegance and legibility of the\nancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals In the old print\neach figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken\nfor the other; in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained\nbefore the reader can have any reasonable assurance that he has a 5,\nan 8, or a 3 before him, unless the press work is of the best: this is\nawkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must\nprobably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial\nnecessity: this is the narrowing of the modern letters Most of Jenson's\nletters are designed within a square, the modern letters are narrowed\nby a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much\nhampers the possibility of beauty of design, it is not a real gain, for\nthe modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide\nspaces between his lines, which, probably, the lateral compression of\n\n\nhis letters renders necessary Commercialism again compels the use of\ntype too small in size to be comfortable reading: the size known as\n\"Long primer\" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be\nread Here, again, if the practice of \"leading\" were retrenched larger\ntype could be used without enhancing the price of a book One very important matter in \"setting up\" for fine printing is the\n\"spacing,\" that is, the lateral distance of words from one another In\ngood printing the spaces between the words should be as near as\npossible equal (it is impossible that they should be quite equal except\nin lines of poetry); modern printers understand this, but it is only\npractised in the very best establishments But another point which\nthey should attend to they almost always disregard; this is the\ntendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or \"rivers\"\nin the page, a blemish which can be nearly, though not wholly,\navoided by care and forethought, the desirable thing being \"the\nbreaking of the line\" as in bonding masonry or brickwork, thus:\n\n\nThe general solidity of a page is much to be sought for: modern\nprinters generally overdo the \"whites\" in the spacing, a defect\nprobably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters For where these are boldly and carefully designed, and each letter is\nthoroughly individual in form, the words may be set much closer\ntogether, without loss of clearness No definite rules, however, except\nthe avoidance of \"rivers\" and excess of white, can be given for the\nspacing, which requires the constant exercise of judgment and taste\non the part of the printer The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the\nbook is to have a satisfactory look Here once more the almost\ninvariable modern practice is in opposition to a natural sense of\nproportion From the time when books first took their present shape\ntill the end of the sixteenth century, or indeed later, the page so lay\non the paper that there was more space allowed to the bottom and\nfore margin than to the top and back of the paper, thus:\nthe unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming an\nopening The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his\nown eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in\nthe middle of his paper—only nominally so, however, in many cases,\nsince when he uses a headline he counts that in, the result as\nmeasured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top\none, and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically,\nand that laterally the page looks as if it were being driven off the\npaper The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of\nour subject: of this it may be said that though there is some good\npaper made now, it is never used except for very expensive books,\nalthough it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very\ncheapest The paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad\neven in this country, but is beaten in the race for vileness by that\nmade in America, which is the worst conceivable There seems to be\nno reason why ordinary paper should not be better made, even\nallowing the necessity for a very low price;

    "There seems to be\nno reason why ordinary paper should not be better made, even\nallowing the necessity for a very low price; but any improvement\n\n\nmust be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap, e g g the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a\nsmooth and white surface, which should be indications of a delicacy\nof material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its\ncost One fruitful source of badness in paper is the habit that\npublishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick\npaper almost of the substance of cardboard, a device which deceives\nnobody, and makes a book very unpleasant to read On the whole, a\nsmall book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be\nwithout being transparent The paper used for printing the small\nhighly ornamented French service-books about the beginning of the\nsixteenth century is a model in this respect, being thin, tough, and\nopaque However, the fact must not be blinked that machine-made\npaper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as\nthat made by hand The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt\nwith fully here; but one thing must be said on it The essential point\nto be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether\npicture or pattern-work, should form part of the page, should be a part\nof the whole scheme of the book Simple as this proposition is, it is\nnecessary to be stated, because the modern practice is to disregard the\nrelation between the printing and the ornament altogether, so that if\nthe two are helpful to one another it is a mere matter of accident The\ndue relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly\nunderstood by the old printers; so that even when the woodcuts are\nvery rude indeed, the proportions of the page still give pleasure by the\nsense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey When, as is\nmost often the case, there is actual beauty in the cuts, the books so\nornamented are amongst the most delightful works of art that have\never been produced Therefore, granted well-designed type, due\nspacing of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on the\npaper, all books might be at least comely and well-looking: and if to\nthese good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and\npictures, printed books might once again illustrate to the full the\nposition of our Society that a work of utility might be also a work of\nart, if we cared to make it so William Morris Emery Walker BOOKBINDING\nModern bookbinding dates from the application of printing to\nliterature, and in essentials has remained unchanged to the present\nday, though in those outward characteristics, which appeal to the\ntouch and to the eye, and constitute binding in an artistic sense, it has\ngone through many changes for better and for worse, which, in the\nopinion of the writer, have resulted, in the main, in the exaggeration\nof technical skill and in the death of artistic fancy The first operation of the modern binder is to fold or refold the\nprinted sheet into a section, and to gather the sections, numbered or\nlettered at the foot, in their proper order into a volume The sections are then taken, one by one, placed face downwards in a\nframe, and sewn through the back by a continuous thread running\nbackwards and forwards along the backs of the sections to upright\nstrings fastened at regular intervals in the sewing frame This process\nunites the sections to one another in series one after the other, and\npermits the perusal of the book by the simple turning of leaf after leaf\nupon the hinge formed by the thread and the back of the section A volume, or series of sections, so treated, the ends of the string being\nproperly secured, is essentially \"bound\"; all that is subsequently done\nis done for the protection or for the decoration of the volume or of its\ncover The sides of a volume are protected by millboards, called shortly\n\"boards \" The boards themselves and the back are protected by a cover\nof leather, vellum, silk, linen, or paper, wholly or in part The edges of\nthe volume are protected by the projection of the boards beyond them\nat top, bottom, and fore-edge, and usually by being cut smooth and\ngilt A volume so bound and protected may be decorated by tooling or\notherwise upon all the exposed surfaces (upon the edges, the sides,\nand the back) and may be designated by lettering upon the back or\n\n\nthe sides The degree in which a bound book is protected and decorated will\ndetermine the class to which the binding will belong (1) In cloth binding, the cover, called a \"case,\" is made apart from the\nbook, and is attached as a whole after the book is sewn (2) In half binding, the cover is built up for and on each individual\nbook, but the boards of which it is composed are only partly covered\nwith the leather or other material which covers the back (3) In whole binding, the boards are wholly covered with leather or\nother durable material, which in half binding covers only a portion of\nthem (4) In extra binding, whole binding is advanced a stage higher by\ndecoration Of course in the various stages the details vary\ncommensurately with the stage itself, being more or less elaborate as\nthe stage is higher or lower in the scale The process of extra binding set out in more detail is as follows:—\n(1) First the sections are folded or refolded (2) Then \"end-papers\"—sections of plain paper added at the beginning\nand end of the volume to protect the first and last, the most exposed,\nsections of printed matter constituting the volume proper—having\nbeen prepared and added, the sections are beaten, or rolled, or\npressed, to make them \"solid \"\nThe end-papers are usually added at a later stage, and are pasted on,\nand not sewn, but, in the opinion of the writer, it is better to add\nthem at this stage, and to sew them and not to paste them (3) Then the sections are sewn as already described (4) When sewn the volume passes into the hands of the \"forwarder,\"\nwho\n(5) \"Makes\" the back, beating it round, if the back is to be round, and\n\"backing\" it, or making it fan out from the centre to right and left and\nproject at the edges, to form a kind of ridge to receive and to protect\nthe edges of the boards which form the sides of the cover (6) The back having been made, the \"boards\" (made of millboard, and\noriginally of wood) for the protection of the sides are made and cut to\nshape, and attached by lacing into them the ends of the strings upon\nwhich the book has been sewn (7) The boards having been attached, the edges of the book are now\ncut smooth and even at the top, bottom, and fore-edge, the edges of\nthe boards being used as guides for the purpose In some cases the\norder is reversed, and the edges are first cut and then the boards (8) The edges may now be coloured and gilt, and if it is proposed to\n\"gauffer\" or to decorate them with tooling, they are so treated at this\nstage (9) The head-band is next worked on at head and tail, and the back\nlined with paper or leather or other material to keep the head-band in\nits place and to strengthen the back itself The book is now ready to be covered (10) If the book is covered with leather, the leather is carefully pared\nall round the edges and along the line of the back, to make the edges\nsharp and the joints free (11) The book having been covered, the depression on the inside of\nthe boards caused by the overlap of the leather is filled in with paper,\nso that the entire inner surface may be smooth and even, and ready to\nreceive the first and last leaves of the end-papers, which finally are\ncut to shape and pasted down, leaving the borders only uncovered Sometimes, however, the first and last leaves of the \"end-papers\" are\nof silk, and the \"joint\" of leather, in which case, of course, the end-\npapers are not pasted down, but the insides of the boards are\nindependently treated, and are covered, sometimes with leather,\nsometimes with silk or other material The book is now \"forwarded,\" and passes into the hands of the\n\"finisher\" to be tooled or decorated, or \"finished\" as it is called The decoration in gold on the surface of leather is wrought out, bit by\nbit, by means of small brass stamps called \"tools \"\nThe steps of the process are shortly as follows:—\n\n\n(12) The pattern having been settled and worked out on paper, it is\n\"transferred\" to, or marked out on, the various surfaces to which it is\nto be applied Each surface is then prepared in succession, and, if large, bit by bit, to\nreceive the gold (13) First the leather is washed with water or with vinegar (14) Then the pattern is pencilled over with \"glaire\" (white of egg\nbeaten up and drained off), or the surface is wholly washed with it (15) Next it is smeared lightly with grease or oil (16) And, finally, the gold (gold leaf) is applied by a pad of cotton\nwool, or a flat thin brush called a \"tip \"\n(17) The pattern, visible through the gold, is now reimpressed or\nworked with the tools heated to about the temperature of boiling\nwater, and the unimpressed or waste gold is removed by an oiled rag,\nleaving the pattern in gold and the rest of the leather clear",

    "Cobden-Sanderson OF MURAL PAINTING\nThere seems no precise reason why the subject of this note should\ndiffer much from that of Mr Crane's article on \"Decorative Painting\"\n(pp 39-51) 39-51) \"Mural Painting\" need not, as such, consist of any one sort\nof painting more than another \"Decorative Painting\" does seem, on\nthe other hand, to indicate a certain desire or undertaking to render\nthe object painted more pleasant to the beholder's eye From long habit, however, chiefly induced by the constant practice of\nthe Italians of modern times, \"Mural Painting\" has come to be looked\nupon as figure painting (in fact, the human figure exclusively) on\nwalls—and no other sort of objects can sufficiently impart that dignity\nto a building which it seems to crave for I can think of no valid\nreason why a set of rooms, or walls, should not be decorated with\nanimals in lieu of \"humans,\" as the late Mr Trelawney used to call us:\none wall to be devoted to monkeys, a second to be filled in with\ntigers, a third to be given up to horses, etc etc I know men in\nEngland, and, I believe, some artists, who would be delighted with the\nsubstitution But I hope the general sense of the public would be set\nagainst such subjects, and the lowering effects of them on every one,\nand the kind of humiliation we should feel at knowing them to exist I have been informed that in Berlin the walls of the rooms where the\nantique statues are kept have been painted with mixed subjects\nrepresenting antique buildings with antique Greek views and\nlandscapes, to back up, as it were, the statues I must own it, that\nwithout having seen the decoration in question, I feel filled with\nextreme aversion for the plan The more so when one considers the\nextreme unlikelihood of the same being made tolerable in colour at\nBerlin I have also been told that some painters in the North of\nEngland, bitten with a desire to decorate buildings, have painted one\nset of rooms with landscapes This, without the least knowledge of the\nworks in question, as landscapes, I must allow I regret There is, it\nseems to me, an unbridgeable chasm, not to be passed, between\nlandscape art and the decoration of walls; for the very essence of the\nlandscape art is distance, whereas the very essence of the wall-picture\nis its solidity, or, at least, its not appearing to be a hole in the wall On\nthe matter of subjects fit for painting on walls I may have a few words\n\n\nto say farther on in this paper, but first I had better set down what\nlittle I have to advise with regard to the material and mode of\nexecuting The old-fashioned Italian or \"Buon Fresco\" I look upon as practically\ngiven up in this country, and every other European country that has\nnot a climate to equal Italy If the climate of Paris will not admit of\nthis process, how much less is our damp, foggy, changeable\natmosphere likely to put up with it for many years It is true that the\nfrescoes of William Dyce have lasted for some thirty years without\napparent damage; but also it is the case that the Queen's Robing\nRooms in the House of Lords have been specially guarded against\natmospheric changes of temperature Next to real fresco, there has\nbeen in repute for a time the waterglass process, in which Daniel\nMaclise's great paintings have been executed I see no precise reason\nwhy these noble works should not last, and defy climate for many,\nmany long years yet; though from want of experience he very much\nendangered this durability through the too lavish application of the\nmedium But in Germany, the country of waterglass, the process is\nalready in bad repute The third alternative, \"spirit fresco,\" or what we\nin England claim as the Gambier-Parry process, has, I understand,\nsuperseded it I have myself painted in this system seven works on the\nwalls of the Manchester Town Hall, and have had no reason to\ncomplain of their behaviour Since beginning the series, however, a\nfresh change has come over the fortunes of mural art in the fact that,\nin France (what most strongly recommends itself to common sense),\nthe mural painters have now taken to painting on canvas, which is\nafterwards cemented, or what the French call \"maronflée,\" on to the\nwall White-lead and oil, with a very small admixture of rosin melted\nin oil, are the ingredients used It is laid on cold and plentifully on the\nwall and on the back of the picture, and the painting pressed down\nwith a cloth or handkerchief: nothing further being required, saving to\nguard the edges of the canvas from curling up before the white-lead\nhas had time to harden The advantage of this process of cementing\nlies in the fact that with each succeeding year it must become harder\nand more like stone in its consistency The canvases may be prepared\nas if for oil painting, and painted with common oil-colours flatted (or\nmatted) afterwards by gum-elemi and spike-oil Or the canvas may be\nprepared with the Gambier-Parry colour and painted in that very mat\nmedium The canvases should if possible be fine in texture, as better\n\n\nadapted for adhering to the wall The advantage of this process is\nthat, should at any time, through neglect, damp invade the wall, and\nthe canvas show a tendency to get loose, it would be easy to replace\nit; or the canvas might be altogether detached from the wall and\nstrained as a picture I must now return to the choice of subject, a matter of much\nimportance, but on which it is difficult to give advice One thing,\nhowever, may be urged as a rule, and that is, that very dark or\nRembrandtesque subjects are particularly unsuited for mural\npaintings I cannot go into the reasons for this, but a slight experiment\nought to satisfy the painter, having once heard the principle\nenunciated: that is, if he belong to the class likely to succeed at such\nwork Another sine qua non as to subject is that the painter himself must be\nallowed to select it It is true that certain limitations may be accorded\n—for instance, the artist may be required to select a subject with\ncertain tendencies in it—but the actual invention of the subject and\nworking out of it must be his In fact, the painter himself is the only\njudge of what he is likely to carry out well and of the subjects that are\npaintable Then much depends on whom the works are for; if for the\ngeneral public, and carried out with their money, care (it seems to me\nbut fair) should be taken that the subjects are such as they can\nunderstand and take interest in If, on the contrary, you are painting\nfor highly-cultured people with a turn for Greek myths, it is quite\nanother thing; then, such a subject as \"Eros reproaching his brother\nAnteros for his coldness\" might be one offering opportunities for\nshades of sentiment suited to the givers of the commissions\nconcerned But for such as have not been trained to entertain these\nrefinements, downright facts, either in history or in sociology, are\ncalculated most to excite the imagination It is not always necessary\nfor the spectator to be exact in his conclusions",
    "It is not always necessary\nfor the spectator to be exact in his conclusions I remember once at\nManchester, the members of a Young Men's Christian Association had\ncome to a meeting in the great hall Some of them were there too\nsoon, and so were looking round the room One observed: \"What's this\nabout \" His friend answered: \"Fallen off a ladder, the police are\nrunning him in \" Well, this was not quite correct A wounded young\nDanish chieftain was being hurried out of Manchester on his\ncomrade's shoulders, with a view to save his life The Phrygian\nhelmets of the Danes indicated neither firemen nor policemen; but the\n\n\nidea was one of misfortune, and care bestowed on it—and did as well,\nand showed sympathy in a somewhat uncultivated, though well-\nintentioned, class of Lancastrians On the other hand, I have noticed\nthat subjects that interest infallibly all classes, educated or illiterate,\nare religious subjects It is not a question of piety—but comes from\nthe simple breadth of poetry and humanity usually involved in this\nclass of subject That the amount of religiosity in either spectator or\nproducer has nothing to do with the feeling is clear if we consider The Spaniards are one of the most religious peoples ever known, and\nyet their art is singularly deficient in this quality Were there ever two\ngreat painters as wanting in the sacred feeling as Velasquez and\nMurillo and yet, in all probability, they were more religious than\nourselves It only remains for me to point to the fact that mural painting, when it\nhas been practised jointly by those who were at the same time easel-\npainters, has invariably raised those painters to far higher flights and\ninstances of style than they seem capable of in the smaller path Take\nthe examples left us, say by Raphael and Michel Angelo, or some of\nthe earlier masters, such as the \"Fulminati\" of Signorelli, compared\nwith his specimens in our National Gallery; or the works left on walls\nby even less favoured artists, such as Domenichino and Andrea del\nSarto, or the French de la Roche's \"Hémicycle,\" or our own great\npainters Dyce and Maclise's frescoes; the same rise in style, the same\nimprovement, is everywhere to be noticed, both in drawing, in colour,\nand in flesh-painting F Madox Brown",
    "Madox Brown OF SGRAFFITO WORK\nThe Italian words Graffiato, Sgraffiato, or Sgraffito, mean \"Scratched,\"\nand scratched work is the oldest form of graphic expression and\nsurface decoration used by man The term Sgraffito is, however, specially used to denote decoration\nscratched or incised upon plaster or potter's clay while still soft, and\nfor beauty of effect depends either solely upon lines thus incised\naccording to design, with the resulting contrast of surfaces, or partly\nupon such lines and contrast, and partly upon an under-coat of colour\nrevealed by the incisions; while, again, the means at disposal may be\nincreased by varying the colours of the under-coat in accordance with\nthe design Of the potter's sgraffito I have no experience, but it is my present\npurpose briefly and practically to examine the method, special\naptitudes, and limitations of polychrome sgraffito as applied to the\nplasterer's craft First, then, as to method Given the wall intended to be treated:\ngranted the completion of the scheme of decoration, the cartoons\nhaving been executed in several colours and the outlines firmly\npricked, and further, all things being ready for beginning work Hack\noff any existing plaster from the wall: when bare, rake and sweep out\nthe joints thoroughly: when clean, give the wall as much water as it\nwill drink: lay the coarse coat, leaving the face rough in order to make\na good key for the next coat: when sufficiently set, fix your cartoon in\nits destined position with slate nails: pounce through the pricked\noutlines: remove the cartoon: replace the nails in the register holes:\nmark in with a brush in white oil paint the spaces for the different\ncolours as shown in the cartoon, and pounced in outline on the coarse\ncoat, placing the letters B, R, Y, etc , as the case may be, in order to\nshow the plasterer where to lay the different colours—Black, Red,\nYellow, etc : give the wall as much water as it will drink: lay the\ncolour coat in accordance with the lettered spaces on the coarse coat,\ntaking care not to displace the register nails, and leaving plenty of key\nfor the final surface coat In laying the colour coat, calculate how much of the colour surface it\n\n\nmay be advisable to get on the wall, as the same duration of time\nshould be maintained throughout the work between the laying of the\ncolour coat and the following on with the final surface coat—for this\nreason, if the colour coat sets hard before the final coat is laid, it will\nnot be possible to scrape up the colour to its full strength wherever it\nmay be revealed by incision of the design When sufficiently set, i e in\nabout 24 hours, follow on with the final surface coat, only laying as\nmuch as can be cut and cleaned up in a day: when this is sufficiently\nsteady, fix up the cartoon in its registered position: pounce through\nthe pricked outlines: remove the cartoon and cut the design in the\nsurface coat before it sets: then, if your register is correct, you will cut\nthrough to different colours according to the design, and in the course\nof a few days the work should set as hard and homogeneous as stone,\nand as damp-proof as the nature of things permits The three coats above referred to may be gauged as follows:—\nCoarse Coat —2 or 3 of sharp clean sand to 1 of Portland, to be laid\nabout ¾ inch in thickness This coat is to promote an even suction and\nto keep back damp Colour Coat —1 of colour to 1½ of old Portland, to be laid about 1/8\ninch in thickness Specially prepared distemper colours should be\nused, and amongst such may be mentioned golden ochre, Turkey red,\nIndian red, manganese black, lime blue, and umber Final Surface Coat —Aberthaw lime and selenitic cement, both sifted\nthrough a fine sieve—the proportions of the gauge depend upon the\nheat of the lime: or, Parian cement sifted as above—air-slaked for 24\nhours, and gauged with water coloured with ochre, so as to give a\ncreamy tone when the plaster dries out: or, 3 of selenitic cement to 2\nof silver sand, both sifted as above—this may be used for out-door\nwork Individual taste and experience must decide as to the thickness of the\nfinal coat, but if laid between 1/8 and 1/12 inch, and the lines cut with\nslanting edges, a side light gives emphasis to the finished result,\nmaking the outlines tell alternately as they take the light or cast a\nshadow Plasterers' small tools of various kinds and knife-blades fixed\nin tool handles will be found suited to the simple craft of cutting and\nclearing off the final surface coat; but as to this a craftsman finds his\nown tools by experience, and indeed by the same acquired perception\n\n\nmust be interpreted all the foregoing directions, and specially that\nambiguous word, dear to the writers of recipes,—Sufficient Thus far method Now, as to special aptitudes and limitations Sgraffito work may claim a special aptitude for design whose centre of\naim is line It has no beauty of material like glass, no mystery of\nsurface like mosaic, no pre-eminence of subtly-woven tone and colour\nlike tapestry; yet it gives freer play to line than any of these\nmentioned fields of design, and a cartoon for sgraffito can be executed\nin facsimile, undeviated by warp and woof, and unchecked by angular\ntesseræ or lead lines True, hardness of design may easily result from\nthis aptitude, indeed is to a certain extent inherent to the method\nunder examination, but in overcoming this danger and in making the\nmost of this aptitude is the artist discovered Sgraffito from its very nature \"asserts the wall\"; that is, preserves the\nsolid appearance of the building which it is intended to decorate The\ndecoration is in the wall rather than on the wall It seems to be\norganic The inner surface of the actual wall changes colour in\npuzzling but orderly sequence, as the upper surface passes into\nexpressive lines and spaces, delivers its simple message, and then\nrelapses into silence; but whether incised with intricate design, or left\nin plain relieving spaces, the wall receives no further treatment, the\nmarks of float, trowel, and scraper remain, and combine to make a\nnatural surface It compels the work to be executed in situ The studio must be\nexchanged for the scaffold, and the result should justify the\ninconvenience However carefully the scheme of decoration may be\ndesigned, slight yet important modifications and readjustments will\nprobably be found necessary in the transfer from cartoon to wall; and\nthough the ascent of the scaffold may seem an indignity to those who\nprefer to suffer vicariously in the execution of their works, and though\nwe of the nineteenth know, as Cennini of the fifteenth century knew,\n\"that painting pictures is the proper employment of a gentleman, and\nwith velvet on his back he may paint what he pleases,\" still the fact\nremains, that if decoration is to attain that inevitable fitness for its\nplace which is the fulfilment of design, this \"proper employment of a\ngentleman\" must be postponed, and velvet exchanged for blouse It compels a quick, sure manner of work; and this quickness of\n\n\nexecution, due to the setting nature of the final coat, and to the\nconsequent necessity of working against time, gives an appearance of\nstrenuous ease to the firm incisions and spaces by which the design is\nexpressed, and a living energy of line to the whole Again, the setting\nnature of the colour coat suggests, and naturally lends itself to, an\noccasional addition in the shape of mosaic to the means at disposal,\nand a little glitter here and there will be found to go a long way in\ngiving points of emphasis and play to large surfaces It compels the artist to adopt a limited colour scheme—a limitation,\nand yet one which may almost be welcomed as an aptitude, for of\ncolours in decorative work multiplication may be said to be a\nvexation Finally, the limitations of sgraffito as a method of expression are the\nsame as those of all incised or line work By it you can express ideas\nand suggest life, but you cannot realise,—cannot imitate the natural\nobjects on which your graphic language is founded The means at\ndisposal are too scanty Item: white lines and spaces relieved against\nand slightly raised on a coloured ground; coloured lines and spaces\nslightly sunk on a white surface; intricacy relieved by simplicity of\nline, and again either relieved by plain spaces of coloured ground or\nwhite surface Indeed they are simple means Yet line still remains the\nreadiest manner of graphic expression; and if in the strength of\nlimitation our past masters of the arts and crafts have had power to\n\"free, arouse, dilate\" by their simple record of hand and soul, we also\nshould be able to bring forth new achievement from old method, and\nto suggest the life and express the ideas which sway the latter years of\nour own century Heywood Sumner",
    "Heywood Sumner OF STUCCO AND GESSO\nFew things are more disheartening to the pursuer of plastic art than\nfinding that, when he has carried his own labour to a certain point, he\nhas to entrust it to another in order to render it permanent and useful If he models in clay and wishes it burnt into terra cotta, the shrinkage\nand risk in firing, and the danger in transport to the kiln, are a\nnightmare to him If he wishes it cast in plaster, the distortion by\nwaste-moulding, or the cost of piece-moulding, are serious grievances\nto him, considering that after all he has but a friable result; and\nthough this latter objection is minimised by Mrs Laxton Clark's\ningenious process of indurating plaster, yet I am persuaded that most\nmodellers would prefer to complete their work in some permanent\nform with their own hands Having this desirable end in view, I wish to draw their attention to\nsome disused processes which once largely prevailed, by which the\nartist is enabled to finish, and render durable and vendible, his work,\nwithout having to part with it or pay for another's aid These old processes are modelling in Stucco-duro and Gesso Stucco-duro, although of very ancient practice, is now practically a\nlost art The materials required are simply well-burnt and slacked\nlime, a little fine sand, and some finely-ground unburnt lime-stone or\nwhite marble dust These are well tempered together with water and\nbeaten up with sticks until a good workable paste results In fact, the\npreparation of the materials is exactly the same as that described by\nVitruvius, who recommends that the fragments of marble be sifted\ninto three degrees of fineness, using the coarser for the rough bossage,\nthe medium for the general modelling, and the finest for the surface\nfinish, after which it can be polished with chalk and powdered lime if\nnecessary Indeed, to so fine a surface can this material be brought,\nand so highly can it be polished, that he mentions its use for mirrors The only caution that it is needful to give is to avoid working too\nquickly; for, as Sir Henry Wooton, King James's ambassador at Venice,\nwho greatly advocated the use of stucco-duro, observed, the stucco\nworker \"makes his figures by addition and the carver by subtraction,\"\nand to avoid too great risk of the work cracking in drying, these\n\n\nadditions must be made slowly where the relief is great If the relief is\nvery great, or if a figure of large dimensions is essayed, it may be\nneedful even to delay the drying of the stucco, and the addition of a\nlittle stiff paste will insure this, so that the work may be consecutively\nworked upon for many days From the remains of the stucco work of classic times left us, we can\nrealise how perfectly workable this material was; and if you examine\nthe plaster casts taken from some most delicate low-relief plaques in\nstucco exhumed some ten years ago near the Villa Farnesina at Rome,\nor the rougher and readier fragments of stucco-duro itself from some\nItalo-Greek tombs, both of which are to be seen in the South\nKensington Museum, you will at once be convinced of the great\napplicability of the process With the decadence of classic art some portion of the process seems to\nhave been lost, and the use of pounded travertine was substituted for\nwhite marble; but, as the bassi-relievi of the early Renaissance were\nmostly decorated with colour, this was not important The ground\ncolours seem generally to have been laid on whilst the stucco was\nwet, as in fresco, and the details heightened with tempera or encaustic\ncolours, sometimes with accessories enriched in gilt \"gesso\" (of which\nhereafter) Many remains of these exist, and in the Nineteenth Winter\nExhibition of the Royal Academy there were no less than twelve very\ninteresting examples of it exhibited, and in the South Kensington\nMuseum are some few moderately good illustrations of it It was not, however, until the sixteenth century that the old means of\nproducing the highly-finished white stucchi were rediscovered, and\nthis revival of the art as an architectonic accessory is due to the\nexhumation of the baths of Titus under Leo X Raphael and Giovanni\nda Udine were then so struck with the beauty of the stucco work thus\nexposed to view that its re-use was at once determined upon, and the\nLoggia of the Vatican was the first result of many experiments, though\nthe re-invented process seems to have been precisely that described by\nVitruvius Naturally, the art of modelling in stucco at once became\npopular: the patronage of it by the Pope, and the practice of it by the\nartists who worked for him, gave it the highest sanction, and hardly a\nbuilding of any architectural importance was erected in Italy during\nthe sixteenth century that did not bear evidence of the artistic craft of\nthe stuccatori There has just (Autumn, 1889) arrived at the South Kensington\nMuseum a model of the central hall of the Villa Madama in Rome,\nthus decorated by Giulio Romano and Giovanni da Udine, which\nexemplifies the adaptability of the process; and in this model Cav Mariani has employed stucco-duro for its execution, showing to how\nhigh a pitch of finish this material is capable of being carried Indeed,\nit was used by goldsmiths for the models for their craft, as being less\nliable to injury than wax, yet capable of receiving equally delicate\ntreatment; and Benvenuto Cellini modelled the celebrated \"button,\"\nwith \"that magnificent big diamond\" in the middle, for the cope of\nPope Clement, with all its intricate detail, in this material How\nminute this work of some six inches diameter was may be inferred\nfrom Cellini's own description of it Above the diamond, in the centre\nof the piece, was shown God the Father seated, in the act of giving the\nbenediction; below were three children, who, with their arms\nupraised, were supporting the jewel One of them, in the middle, was\nin full relief, the other two in half-relief \"All round I set a crowd of\ncherubs in divers attitudes A mantle undulated to the wind around\nthe figure of the Father, from the folds of which cherubs peeped out;\nand there were many other ornaments besides, which,\" adds he, and\nfor once we may believe him, \"made a very beautiful effect \" At the\nsame time, figures larger than life, indeed colossal figures, were\nexecuted in it, and in our own country the Italian artists brought over\nby our Henry VIII worked in that style for his vanished palace of\nNonsuch Gradually, stucco-duro fell into disuse, and coarse pargetry\nand modelled plaster ceilings became in later years its sole and\ndegenerate descendants Gesso is really a painter's art rather than a sculptor's, and consists in\nimpasto painting with a mixture of plaster of Paris or whiting in glue\n(the composition with which the ground of his pictures is laid) after\nroughly modelling the higher forms with tow or some fibrous material\nincorporated with the gesso; but it is questionable if gesso is the best\nvehicle for any but the lowest relief By it the most subtle and delicate\nvariation of surface can be obtained, and the finest lines pencilled,\nanalogous, in fact, to the fine pâte sur pâte work in porcelain Its chief\nuse in early times was in the accessories of painting, as the nimbi,\nattributes, and jewellery of the personage represented, and it was\nalmost entirely used as a ground-work for gilding upon Abundant\nillustration of this usage will be found in the pictures by the early\n\n\nItalian masters in the National Gallery The retables of altars were\nlargely decorated in this material, a notable example being that still\nexisting in Westminster Abbey Many of the gorgeous accessories to the panoply of war in mediæval\ntimes, such as decorative shields and the lighter military\naccoutrements, were thus ornamented in low relief, and on the high-\ncruppered and high-peaked saddles it was abundantly displayed In\nthe sixteenth-century work of Germany it seems to have received an\nadmixture of finely-pounded lithographic stone, or hone stone, by\nwhich it became of such hardness as to be taken for sculpture in these\nmaterials Its chief use, however, was for the decoration of the caskets\nand ornamental objects which make up the refinement of domestic\nlife, and the base representative of it which figures on our picture-\nframes claims a noble ancestry Its tenacity, when well prepared, is exceedingly great, and I have used\nit on glass, on polished marble, on porcelain, and such like non-\nabsorbent surfaces, from which it can scarcely be separated without\ndestruction of its base Indeed, for miniature art, gesso possesses\ninnumerable advantages not presented by any other medium, but it is\nhardly available for larger works Time and space will not permit my entering more fully into these two\nforms of plastic art; but seeing that we are annually receiving such\nlarge accessions to the numbers of our modellers, and as, of course, it\nis not possible for all these to achieve success in, or find a means of\nliving by, the art of sculpture in marble, I have sought to indicate a\nhome-art means by which, at very moderate cost, they can bring their\nlabours in useful form before the world, and at the same time learn\nand live G T Robinson",
    "Robinson OF CAST IRON\nCast iron is nearly our humblest material, and with associations less\nthan all artistic, for it has been almost hopelessly vulgarised in the\npresent century, so much so that Mr Ruskin, with his fearless use of\nparadox to shock one into thought, has laid it down that cast iron is\nan artistic solecism, impossible for architectural service now, or at any\ntime And yet, although we can never claim for iron the beauty of\nbronze, it is in some degree a parallel material, and has been used\nwith appreciation in many ways up to the beginning of this century Iron was already known in Sussex at the coming of the Romans Throughout this county and Kent, in out-of-the-way farm-houses, iron\nfire-backs to open hearths, fine specimens of the founder's art, are still\nin daily use as they have been for three hundred years or more Some\nhave Gothic diapers and meanders of vine with heraldic badges and\ninitials, and are evidently cast from models made in the fifteenth\ncentury, patterns that remained in stock and were cast from again and\nagain Others, of the following centuries, have coat-arms and\nsupporters, salamanders in the flames, figures, a triton or centaur, or\neven a scene, the Judgment of Solomon, or Marriage of Alexander, or,\nmore appropriately, mere pattern-work, vases of flowers and the like However crude they may be, and some are absurdly inadequate as\nsculpture, the sense of treatment and relief suitable to the material\nnever fails to give them a fit interest With these backs cast-iron fire-dogs are often found, of which some\nGothic examples also remain, simple in form with soft dull modelling;\nlater, these were often a mere obelisk on a base surmounted by a ball\nor a bird, or rude terminal figures; sometimes a more delicate full\nfigure, the limbs well together, so that nothing projects from the\ngeneral post-like form; and within their limitations they are not\nwithout grace and character In Frant church, near Tunbridge, are several cast-iron grave slabs\nabout six feet long by half that width, perfectly flat, one with a single\nshield of arms and some letters, others with several; they are quite\nsuccessful, natural, and not in the least vulgar Iron railings are the most usual form of cast iron as an accessory to\n\n\narchitecture; the earlier examples of these in London are thoroughly\nfit for their purpose and their material; sturdily simple forms of gently\nswelling curves, or with slightly rounded reliefs The original railing\nat St Paul's, of Lamberhurst iron, is the finest of these, a large portion\nof which around the west front was removed in 1873 Another\nexample encloses the portico of St Martin's-in-the-Fields",
    "Martin's-in-the-Fields The railing\nof the central area of Berkeley Square is beautifully designed, and\nthere are instances here, as in Grosvenor Square, where cast iron is\nused together with wrought, a difficult combination Balcony railings and staircase balustrades are quite general to houses\nof the late eighteenth century Refined and thoroughly good of their\nkind, they never fail to please, and never, of course, imitate wrought\niron The design is always direct, unpretentious and effortless, in a\nmanner that became at this time quite a tradition The verandahs also, of which there are so many in Piccadilly or\nMayfair, with posts reeded and of delicate profiles, are of the same\nkind, confessedly cast iron, and never without the characterising\ndulness of the forms, so that they have no jutting members to be\nbroken off, to expose a repulsive jagged fracture The opposite of all\nthese qualities may be found in the \"expensive\"-looking railing on the\nEmbankment enclosing the gardens, whose tiny fretted and fretful\nforms invite an experiment often successful It must be understood that cast iron should be merely a flat lattice-like\ndesign, obviously cast in panels, or plain post and rail construction\nwith cast uprights and terminal knops tenoned into rails, so that there\nis no doubt of straightforward unaffected fitting The British Museum\nscreen may be taken to instance how ample ability will not redeem\nfalse principles of design: the construction is not clear, nor are the\nforms sufficiently simple, the result being only a high order of\ncommonplace grandeur Even the lamp-posts set up in the beginning of the century for oil\nlights, a few of which have not yet been improved away from back\nstreets, show the same care for appropriate form Some of the Pall\nMall Clubs, again, have well-designed candelabra of a more\npretentious kind; also London and Waterloo Bridges The fire-grates, both with hobs and close fronts, that came into use\nabout the middle of the last century, are decorated all over the field\n\n\nwith tiny flutings, beads, and leaf mouldings, sometimes even with\nlittle figure medallions, and carry delicacy to its limit The better\nexamples are entirely successful, both in form and in the\nornamentation, which, adapted to this new purpose, does no more\nthan gracefully acknowledge its debt to the past, just as the best\nornament at all times is neither original nor copied: it must recognise\ntradition, and add something which shall be the tradition of the\nfuture The method followed is to keep the general form quite simple\nand the areas flat, while the decoration, just an embroidery of the\nsurface, is of one substance and in the slightest possible relief Other\nlarger grates there were with plain surfaces simply framed with\nmouldings Even the sculptor has not refused iron Pliny says there were two\nstatues in Rhodes, one of iron and copper, and the other, a Hercules,\nentirely of iron",
    "Pliny says there were two\nstatues in Rhodes, one of iron and copper, and the other, a Hercules,\nentirely of iron In the palace at Prague there is a St In the palace at Prague there is a St George horsed\nand armed, the work of the fourteenth century The qualities natural\nto iron which it has to offer for sculpture may best be appreciated by\nseeing the examples at the Museum of Geology, in Jermyn Street On\nthe staircase there are two large dogs, two ornamental candelabra,\nand two figures; the dogs, although not fine as sculpture, are well\ntreated, in mass and surface, for the metal In the same museum there\nis a smaller statue still better for surface and finish, a French work\nsigned and dated 1841, and, therefore, half an antique But for\nordinary foundry-work without surface finish—probably the most\nappropriate, certainly the most available, method—the little lions on\nthe outer rail at the British Museum are proof of how sufficient feeling\nfor design will dignify any material for any object; they are by the late\nAlfred Stevens, and are thoroughly iron beasts, so slightly modelled\nthat they would be only blocked out for bronze In the Geological\nMuseum are also specimens of Berlin and Ilsenburg manufacture; they\nserve to point the moral that ingenuity is not art, nor tenuity\nrefinement The question of rust is a difficult one, the oxide not being an added\nbeauty like the patina acquired by bronze, yet the decay of cast iron is\nmuch less than is generally thought, especially on large smooth\nsurfaces, if the casting has been once treated by an oil bath or a\ncoating of hot tar: the celebrated iron pillar of Delhi, some twenty feet\nhigh, has stood for fourteen centuries, and shows, it is said, little\nevidence of decay It would be interesting to see how cast spheres of\n\n\ngood iron would be affected in our climate, if occasionally coated\nwith a lacquer In painting, the range of tints best approved is black\nthrough gray to white: the simple negative gray gives a pleasant\nunobtrusiveness to the well-designed iron-work of the Northern\nStation in Paris, whereas our almost universal Indian red is a very bad\nchoice—a hot coarse colour, you must see it, and be irritated, and it is\nsurely the only colour that gets worse as it bleaches in the sun Gilding is suitable to a certain extent; but for internal work the\nhomely black-leading cannot be bettered To put together the results obtained in our examination of examples (1) The metal must be both good and carefully manipulated (2) The design must be thought out through the material and its\ntraditional methods (3) The pattern must have the ornament modelled, not carved, as is\nalmost universally the case now, carving in wood being entirely unfit\nto give the soft suggestive relief required both by the nature of the\nsand-mould into which it is impressed, and the crystalline structure of\nthe metal when cast (4) Flat surfaces like grate fronts may be decorated with some\nintricacy if the relief is delicate But the relief must be less than the\nbasis of attachment, so that the moulding may be easily practicable,\nand no portions invite one to test how easily they might be detached (5) Objects in the round must have a simple and substantial bounding\nform with but little ornament, and that only suggested This applies\nequally to figures In them homogeneous structure is of the first\nimportance (6) When possible, the surface should be finished and left as a metal\ncasting It may, however, be entirely gilt If painted, the colour must\nbe neutral and gray Casting in iron has been so abased and abused that it is almost\ndifficult to believe that the metal has anything to offer to the arts At\nno other time and in no other country would a national staple\ncommodity have been so degraded Yet in its strength under pressure,\nbut fragility to a blow, in certain qualities of texture and of required\nmanipulation, it invites a specially characterised treatment in the\n\n\ndesign, and it offers one of the few materials naturally black available\nin the colour arrangement of interiors W R Lethaby",
    "Lethaby OF DYEING AS AN ART\nDyeing is a very ancient art; from the earliest times of the ancient\ncivilisations till within about forty years ago there had been no\nessential change in it, and not much change of any kind Up to the\ntime of the discovery of the process of Prussian-blue dyeing in about\n1810 (it was known as a pigment thirty or forty years earlier), the\nonly changes in the art were the result of the introduction of the\nAmerican insect dye (cochineal), which gradually superseded the\nEuropean one (kermes), and the American wood-dyes now known as\nlogwood and Brazil-wood: the latter differs little from the Asiatic and\nAfrican Red Saunders, and other red dye-woods; the former has\ncheapened and worsened black-dyeing, in so far as it has taken the\nplace of the indigo-vat as a basis The American quercitron bark gives\nus also a useful additional yellow dye These changes, and one or two others, however, did little towards\nrevolutionising the art; that revolution was left for our own days, and\nresulted from the discovery of what are known as the Aniline dyes,\ndeduced by a long process from the plants of the coal-measures Of\nthese dyes it must be enough to say that their discovery, while\nconferring the greatest honour on the abstract science of chemistry,\nand while doing great service to capitalists in their hunt after profits,\nhas terribly injured the art of dyeing, and for the general public has\nnearly destroyed it as an art Henceforward there is an absolute\ndivorce between the commercial process and the art of dyeing Anyone\nwanting to produce dyed textiles with any artistic quality in them\nmust entirely forgo the modern and commercial methods in favour of\nthose which are at least as old as Pliny, who speaks of them as being\nold in his time Now, in order to dye textiles in patterns or otherwise, we need four\ncolours to start with—to wit, blue, red, yellow, and brown; green,\npurple, black, and all intermediate shades can be made from a\nmixture of these colours Blue is given us by indigo and woad, which do not differ in colour in\nthe least, their chemical product being the same Woad may be called\nnorthern indigo; and indigo tropical or sub-tropical woad Note that until the introduction of Prussian blue about 1810 there was\nno other blue dye except this indigotine that could be called a dye; the\nother blue dyes were mere stains which would not bear the sun for\nmore than a few days Red is yielded by the insect dyes kermes, lac-dye, and cochineal, and\nby the vegetable dye madder Of these, kermes is the king; brighter\nthan madder and at once more permanent and more beautiful than\ncochineal: the latter on an aluminous basis gives a rather cold\ncrimson, and on a tin basis a rather hot scarlet (e",
    "Of these, kermes is the king; brighter\nthan madder and at once more permanent and more beautiful than\ncochineal: the latter on an aluminous basis gives a rather cold\ncrimson, and on a tin basis a rather hot scarlet (e g the dress-coat of a\nline officer) Madder yields on wool a deep-toned blood-red,\nsomewhat bricky and tending to scarlet On cotton and linen, all\nimaginable shades of red according to the process It is not of much\nuse in dyeing silk, which it is apt to \"blind\"; i e it takes off the gloss Lac-dye gives a hot and not pleasant scarlet, as may be noted in a\nprivate militiaman's coat The French liners' trousers, by the way, are,\nor were, dyed with madder, so that their countrymen sometimes call\nthem the \"Madder-wearers\"; but their cloth is somewhat too cheaply\ndyed to do credit to the drysaltery Besides these permanent red dyes there are others produced from\nwoods, called in the Middle Ages by the general name of \"Brazil\";\nwhence the name of the American country, because the conquerors\nfound so much dyeing-wood growing there Some of these wood-dyes\nare very beautiful in colour; but unluckily they are none of them\npermanent, as you may see by examining the beautiful stuffs of the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries at the South Kensington Museum,\nin which you will scarcely find any red, but plenty of fawn-colour,\nwhich is in fact the wood-red of 500 years ago thus faded If you turn\nfrom them to the Gothic tapestries, and note the reds in them, you\nwill have the measure of the relative permanence of kermes and\n\"Brazil,\" the tapestry reds being all dyed with kermes, and still\nretaining the greater part of their colour The mediæval dyers must be\npartly excused, however, because \"Brazil\" is especially a silk dye,\nkermes sharing somewhat in the ill qualities of madder for silk;\nthough I have dyed silk in kermes and got very beautiful and powerful\ncolours by means of it Yellow dyes are chiefly given us by weld (sometimes called wild\nmignonette), quercitron bark (above mentioned), and old fustic, an\nAmerican dye-wood Of these weld is much the prettiest, and is the\n\n\nyellow silk dye par excellence, though it dyes wool well enough But\nyellow dyes are the commonest to be met with in nature, and our\nfields and hedgerows bear plenty of greening-weeds, as our\nforefathers called them, since they used them chiefly for greening blue\nwoollen cloth; for, as you may well believe, they, being good\ncolourists, had no great taste for yellow woollen stuff Dyers'-broom,\nsaw-wort, the twigs of the poplar, the osier, and the birch, heather,\nbroom, flowers and twigs, will all of them give yellows of more or less\npermanence Of these I have tried poplar and osier twigs, which both\ngave a strong yellow, but the former not a very permanent one Speaking generally, yellow dyes are the least permanent of all, as once\nmore you may see by looking at an old tapestry, in which the greens\nhave always faded more than the reds or blues; the best yellow dyes,\nhowever, lose only their brighter shade, the \"lemon\" colour, and leave\na residuum of brownish yellow, which still makes a kind of a green\nover the blue Brown is best got from the roots of the walnut tree, or in their default\nfrom the green husks of the nuts This material is especially best for\n\"saddening,\" as the old dyers used to call it The best and most\nenduring blacks also were done with this simple dye-stuff, the goods\nbeing first dyed in the indigo or woad-vat till they were a very dark\nblue and then browned into black by means of the walnut-root Catechu, the inspissated juice of a plant or plants, which comes to us\nfrom India, also gives rich and useful permanent browns of various\nshades Green is obtained by dyeing a blue of the required shade in the\nindigo-vat, and then greening it with a good yellow dye, adding what\nelse may be necessary (as, e g , madder) to modify the colour\naccording to taste Purple is got by blueing in the indigo-vat, and afterwards by a bath of\ncochineal, or kermes, or madder; all intermediate shades of claret and\nmurrey and russet can be got by these drugs helped out by\n\"saddening \"\nBlack, as aforesaid, is best made by dyeing dark blue wool with\nbrown; and walnut is better than iron for the brown part, because the\niron-brown is apt to rot the fibre; as once more you will see in some\npieces of old tapestry or old Persian carpets, where the black is quite\n\n\nperished, or at least in the case of the carpet gone down to the knots All intermediate shades can, as aforesaid, be got by the blending of\nthese prime colours, or by using weak baths of them For instance, all\nshades of flesh colour can be got by means of weak baths of madder\nand walnut \"saddening\"; madder or cochineal mixed with weld gives\nus orange, and with saddening all imaginable shades between yellow\nand red, including the ambers, maize-colour, etc The crimsons in\nGothic tapestries must have been got by dyeing kermes over pale\nshades of blue, since the crimson red-dye, cochineal, had not yet come\nto Europe A word or two (entirely unscientific) about the processes of this old-\nfashioned or artistic dyeing In the first place, all dyes must be soluble colours, differing in this\nrespect from pigments; most of which are insoluble, and are only very\nfinely divided, as, e",
    "In the first place, all dyes must be soluble colours, differing in this\nrespect from pigments; most of which are insoluble, and are only very\nfinely divided, as, e g , ultramarine, umber, terre-verte Next, dyes may be divided into those which need a mordant and those\nwhich do not; or, as the old chemist Bancroft very conveniently\nexpresses it, into adjective and substantive dyes Indigo is the great substantive dye: the indigo has to be de-oxidised\nand thereby made soluble, in which state it loses its blue colour in\nproportion as the solution is complete; the goods are plunged into this\nsolution and worked in it \"between two waters,\" as the phrase goes,\nand when exposed to the air the indigo they have got on them is\nswiftly oxidised, and once more becomes insoluble This process is\nrepeated till the required shade is got All shades of blue can be got by\nthis means, from the pale \"watchet,\" as our forefathers called it, up to\nthe blue which the eighteenth-century French dyers called \"Bleu\nd'enfer \" Navy Blue is the politer name for it to-day in England I must\nadd that, though this seems an easy process, the setting of the blue-vat\nis a ticklish job, and requires, I should say, more experience than any\nother dyeing process The brown dyes, walnut and catechu, need no mordant, and are\nsubstantive dyes; some of the yellows also can be dyed without\nmordant, but are much improved by it The red dyes, kermes and\nmadder, and the yellow dye weld, are especially mordant or adjective\ndyes: they are all dyed on an aluminous basis To put the matter\nplainly, the goods are worked in a solution of alum (usually with a\n\n\nlittle acid added), and after an interval of a day or two (ageing) are\ndyed in a bath of the dissolved dye-stuff A lake is thus formed on the fibre which is in most cases very durable The effect of this \"mordanting\" of the fibre is clearest seen in the\nmaddering of printed cotton goods, which are first printed with\naluminous mordants of various degrees of strength (or with iron if\nblack is needed, or a mixture of iron with alumina for purple), and\nthen dyed wholesale in the madder-beck: the result being that the\nparts which have been mordanted come out various shades of red,\netc , according to the strength or composition of the mordant, while\nthe unmordanted parts remain a dirty pink, which has to be \"cleared\"\ninto white by soaping and exposure to the sun and air; which process\nboth brightens and fixes the dyed parts Pliny saw this going on in Egypt, and it puzzled him very much, that a\ncloth dyed in one colour should come out coloured diversely That reminds me to say a word on the fish-dye of the ancients: it was\na substantive dye and behaved somewhat as indigo It was very\npermanent The colour was a real purple in the modern sense of the\nword, i e a colour or shades of a colour between red and blue The\nreal Byzantine books which are written on purple vellum give you\nsome, at least, of its shades The ancients, you must remember, used\nwords for colours in a way that seems vague to us, because they were\ngenerally thinking of the tone rather than the tint When they wanted\nto specify a red dye they would not use the word purpureus, but\ncoccineus, i e scarlet of kermes The art of dyeing, I am bound to say, is a difficult one, needing for its\npractice a good craftsman, with plenty of experience Matching a\ncolour by means of it is an agreeable but somewhat anxious game to\nplay As to the artistic value of these dye-stuffs, most of which, together\nwith the necessary mordant alumina, the world discovered in early\ntimes (I mean early historical times), I must tell you that they all make\nin their simplest forms beautiful colours; they need no muddling into\nartistic usefulness, when you need your colours bright (as I hope you\nusually do), and they can be modified and toned without dirtying, as\nthe foul blotches of the capitalist dyer cannot be Like all dyes, they\nare not eternal; the sun in lighting them and beautifying them\n\n\nconsumes them; yet gradually, and for the most part kindly, as (to use\nmy example for the last time in this paper) you will see if you look at\nthe Gothic tapestries in the drawing-room at Hampton Court These\ncolours in fading still remain beautiful, and never, even after long\nwear, pass into nothingness, through that stage of livid ugliness which\ndistinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances, even more than their\nshort and by no means merry life I may also note that no textiles dyed blue or green, otherwise than by\nindigo, keep an agreeable colour by candle-light: many quite bright\ngreens turning into sheer drab A fashionable blue which simulates\nindigo turns into a slaty purple by candle-light; and Prussian blues are\nalso much damaged by it I except from this condemnation a\ncommercial green known as gas-green, which is as abominable as its\nname, both by daylight and gaslight, and indeed one would almost\nexpect it to make unlighted midnight hideous William Morris",
    "William Morris OF EMBROIDERY\nThe technicalities of Embroidery are very simple and its tools few—\npractically consisting of a needle, and nothing else The work can be\nwrought loose in the hand, or stretched in a frame, which latter mode\nis often advisable, always when smooth and minute work is aimed at There are no mysteries of method beyond a few elementary rules that\ncan be quickly learnt; no way to perfection except that of care and\npatience and love of the work itself This being so, the more is\ndemanded from design and execution: we look for complete triumph\nover the limitations of process and material, and, what is equally\nimportant, a certain judgment and self-restraint; and, in short, those\nmental qualities that distinguish mechanical from intelligent work The latitude allowed to the worker; the lavishness and ingenuity\ndisplayed in the stitches employed; in short, the vivid expression of\nthe worker's individuality, form a great part of the success of\nneedlework The varieties of stitch are too many to be closely described without\ndiagrams, but the chief are as follows:—\nChain-stitch consists of loops simulating the links of a simple chain Some of the most famous work of the Middle Ages was worked in this\nstitch, which is enduring, and of its nature necessitates careful\nexecution We are more familiar with it in the dainty work of the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in the airy brightness and\nsimplicity of which lies a peculiar charm, contrasted with the more\npompous and pretentious work of the same period This stitch is also\nwrought with a hook on any loose material stretched in a tambour\nframe Tapestry-stitch consists of a building-up of stitches laid one beside\nanother, and gives a surface slightly resembling that of tapestry I give\nthe name as it is so often used, but it is vague, and leads to the\nconfusion that exists in people's minds between loom-tapestry and\nembroidery The stitch is worked in a frame, and is particularly\nsuitable for the drapery of figures and anything that requires skilful\nblending of several colours, or a certain amount of shading This\nfacility of \"painting\" with the needle is in itself a danger, for it tempts\n\n\nsome people to produce a highly shaded imitation of a picture, an\nattempt which must be a failure both as a decorative and as a pictorial\nachievement It cannot be said too often that the essential qualities of\nall good needlework are a broad surface, bold lines and pure, brilliant\nand, as a rule, simple colouring; all of which being qualities attainable\nthrough, and prescribed by, the limitations of this art Appliqué has been, and is still, a favourite method of work, which\nVasari tells us Botticelli praised as being very suitable to processional\nbanners and hangings used in the open air, as it is solid and enduring,\nalso bold and effective in style It is more accurately described as a\nmethod of work in which various stitches are made use of, for it\nconsists of designs embroidered on a stout ground and then cut out\nand laid on silk or velvet, and edged round with lines of gold or silk,\nand sometimes with pearls It requires considerable deftness and\njudgment in applying, as the work could well be spoilt by clumsy and\nheavy finishing It is now looked upon as solely ecclesiastical, I\nbelieve, and is associated in our minds with garish red, gold and\nwhite, and with dull geometric ornament, though there is absolutely\nno reason why church embroidery of to-day should be limited to\nungraceful forms and staring colours A certain period of work, thick\nand solid, but not very interesting, either as to method or design, has\nbeen stereotyped into what is known as Ecclesiastical Embroidery, the\nmechanical characteristics of the style being, of course, emphasised\nand exaggerated in the process Church work will never be of the\nfinest while these characteristics are insisted on; the more pity, as it is\nseemly that the richest and noblest work should be devoted to\nchurches, and to all buildings that belong to and are an expression of\nthe communal life of the people Another and simpler form of applied\nwork is to cut out the desired forms in one material and lay upon\nanother, securing the appliqué with stitches round the outline, which\nare hidden by an edging cord The work may be further enriched by\nlight ornament of lines and flourishes laid directly on the ground\nmaterial Couching is an effective method of work, in which broad masses of\nsilk or gold thread are laid down and secured by a network or diaper\nof crossing threads, through which the under surface shines very\nprettily It is often used in conjunction with appliqué There are as\nmany varieties of couching stitches as the worker has invention for; in\nsome the threads are laid simply and flatly on the form to be covered,\n\n\nwhile in others a slight relief is obtained by layers of soft linen thread\nwhich form a kind of moulding or stuffing, and which are covered by\nthe silk threads or whatever is to be the final decorative surface The ingenious patchwork coverlets of our grandmothers, formed of\nscraps of old gowns pieced together in certain symmetrical forms,\nconstitute the romance of family history, but this method has an older\norigin than would be imagined Queen Isis-em-Kheb's embalmed body\nwent down the Nile to its burial-place under a canopy that was lately\ndiscovered, and is preserved in the Boulak Museum It consists of\nmany squares of gazelle-hide of different colours sewn together and\nornamented with various devices Under the name of patchwork, or\nmosaic-like piecing together of different coloured stuffs, comes also\nthe Persian work made at Resht Bits of fine cloth are cut out for\nleaves, flowers, and so forth, and neatly stitched together with great\naccuracy This done, the work is further carried out and enriched by\nchain and other stitches The result is perfectly smooth flat work, no\neasy feat when done on a large scale, as it often is Darning and running need little explanation The former stitch is\nfamiliar to us in the well-known Cretan and Turkish cloths: the stitch\nhere is used mechanically in parallel lines, and simulates weaving, so\nthat these handsome borders in a deep rich red might as well have\ncome from the loom as from the needle Another method of darning is\nlooser and coarser, and suitable only for cloths and hangings not\nsubject to much wear and rubbing; the stitches follow the curves of\nthe design, which the needle paints, as it were, shading and blending\nthe colours It is necessary to use this facility for shading temperately,\nhowever, or the flatness essential to decorative work is lost The foregoing is a rough list of stitches which could be copiously\nsupplemented, but that I am obliged to pass on to another important\npoint, that of design If needlework is to be looked upon seriously, it is\nnecessary to secure appropriate and practicable designs Where the\nworker does not invent for herself, she should at least interpret her\ndesigner, just as the designer interprets and does not attempt to\nimitate nature It follows from this, that it is better to avoid using\ndesigns of artists who know nothing of the capacities of needlework,\nand design beautiful and intricate forms without reference to the\nexecution, the result being unsatisfactory and incomplete Regarding\nthe design itself, broad bold lines should be chosen, and broad\n\n\nharmonious colour (which should be roughly planned before setting\nto work), with as much minute work, and stitches introducing play of\ncolour, as befits the purpose of the work and humour of the worker;\nthere should be no scratching, no indefiniteness of form or colour, no\nvagueness that allows the eye to puzzle over the design—beyond that\nindefinable sense of mystery which arrests the attention and\nwithholds the full charm of the work for a moment, to unfold it to\nthose who stop to give it more than a glance But there are so many\ndifferent stitches and so many different modes of setting to work, that\nit will soon be seen that these few hints do not apply to all of them One method, for instance, consists of trusting entirely to design, and\nleaves colour out of account: white work on white linen, white on\ndark ground, or black or dark blue upon white Again, some work\ndepends more on magnificence of colour than on form, as, for\nexample, the handsome Italian hangings of the seventeenth century,\nworked in floss-silk, on linen sometimes, and sometimes on a dusky\nopen canvas which makes the silks gleam and glow like precious\nstones In thus slightly describing the methods chiefly used in embroidery, I\ndo so principally from old examples, as modern embroidery, being a\ndilettante pastime, has little distinct character, and is, in its best\npoints, usually imitative Eastern work still retains the old professional\nskill, but beauty of colour is rapidly disappearing, and little attention\nis paid to durability of the dyes used In speaking rather slightingly of\nmodern needlework, I must add that its non-success is often due more\nto the use of poor materials than to want of skill in working It is\nsurely folly to waste time over work that looks shabby in a month The worker should use judgment and thought to procure materials,\nnot necessarily rich, but each good and genuine of its kind Lastly, she\nshould not be sparing of her own handiwork, for, while a slightly\nexecuted piece of work depends wholly on design, in one where the\nactual stitchery is more elaborate, but the design less masterly, the\npatience and thought lavished on it render it in a different way\nequally pleasing, and bring it more within the scope of the amateur May Morris OF LACE\nLace is a term freely used at the present time to describe various sorts\nof open ornament in thread work, the successful effect of which\ndepends very much upon the contrasting of more or less closely-\ntextured forms with grounds or intervening spaces filled in with\nmeshes of equal size or with cross-ties, bars, etc Whence it has come\nto pass that fabrics having an appearance of this description, such as\nembroideries upon nets, cut linen works, drawn thread works, and\nmachine-woven counterfeits of lace-like fabrics, are frequently called\nlaces But they differ in make from those productions of certain\nspecialised handicrafts to which from the sixteenth to the eighteenth\ncenturies lace owes its fame These specialised handicrafts are divisible into two branches The one\nbranch involves the employment of a needle to loop a continuous\nthread into varieties of shapes and devices; the other is in the nature\nof making corresponding or similar ornament by twisting and plaiting\ntogether a number of separate threads, the loose ends of which have\nto be fastened in a row on a cushion or pillow, the supply of the\nthreads being wound around the heads of lengthened bobbins, so\nshaped for convenience in handling The first-named branch is\nneedlepoint lace-making; the second, bobbin or pillow lace-making Needlepoint lace-making may be regarded as a species of embroidery,\nwhilst bobbin or pillow lace-making is closely allied to the twisting\nand knotting together of threads for fringes Embroidery, however,\npostulates a foundation of material to be enriched with needlework,\nwhereas needlepoint and pillow lace are wrought independently of\nany corresponding foundation of material The production of slender needles and small metal pins is an\nimportant incident in the history of lace-making by hand Broadly\nspeaking, the manufacture for a widespread consumption of such\nmetal pins and needles does not date earlier than the fourteenth\ncentury Without small implements of this character delicate lace-\nmaking is not possible It is therefore fair to assume that although\nhistoric nations like the Egyptian, Assyrian, Hebrew, Greek, and\nRoman, made use of fringes and knotted cords upon their hangings,\ncloaks, and tunics, lace was unknown to them Their bone, wooden, or\n\n\nmetal pins and needles were suited to certain classes of embroidery\nand to the making of nets, looped cords, etc , but not to such lace-\nmaking as we know it from the early days of the sixteenth century About the end of the fifteenth century, with the development in\nEurope of fine linen for underclothing, collars and cuffs just visible\nbeyond the outer garments came into vogue, and a taste was speedily\nmanifested for trimming linen undershirts, collars and cuffs, with\ninsertions and borders of kindred material This taste seems to have\nbeen first displayed in a marked manner by Venetian and Flemish\nwomen; for the earliest known books of engraved patterns for linen\nornamental borders and insertions are those which were published\nduring the commencement of the sixteenth century at Venice and\nAntwerp But such patterns were designed in the first place for various\nsorts of embroidery upon a material, such as darning upon canvas\n(punto fa su la rete a maglia quadra), drawn thread work of reticulated\npatterns (punto tirato or punto a reticella), and cut work (punto tagliato) Patterns for quite other sorts of work, such as point in the air (punto in\naere) and thread work twisted and plaited by means of little leaden\nweights or bobbins (merletti a piombini), were about thirty years later\nin publication These two last-named classes of work are respectively\nidentifiable (punto in aere) with needlepoint and (merletti a piombini)\nwith bobbin lace-making; and they seem to date from about 1540 The sixteenth-century and earliest known needlepoint laces (punto in\naere) are of narrow lengths or bands, the patterns of which are\ncomposed principally of repeated open squares filled in with circular,\nstar, and other geometric shapes, set upon diagonal and cross lines\nwhich radiate from the centre of each square to its corners and sides When the bands were to serve as borders they would have a dentated\nedging added to them; this edging might be made of either\nneedlepoint or bobbin lace As time went on the dimensions of both\nlace bands and lace vandykes increased so that, whilst these served as\ntrimmings to linen, lace of considerable width and various shapes\ncame to be made, and ruffs, collars, and cuffs were wholly made of it Such lace was thin and wiry in appearance The leading lines of the\npatterns formed squares and geometrical figures, amongst which were\ndisposed small wheel and seed forms, little triangles, and such like A\nfew years later the details of these geometrically planned patterns\nbecame more varied, tiny human figures, fruits, vases and flowers,\nbeing used as ornamental details But a more distinct change in\n\n\ncharacter of pattern was effected when flowing scrolls with leaf and\nblossom devices, held together by means of little ties or bars, were\nadopted Different portions of the scrolls and blossoms with their\nconnecting links or bars would often be enriched with little loops or\npicots, with stitched reliefs, and varieties of close and open work Then\ncame a taste for arranging the bars or ties into trellis grounds, or\ngrounds of hexagons, over which small ornamental devices would be\nscattered in balanced groups At the same time, the bobbin or pillow\nlace-workers produced grounds of small equal-size meshes in plaited\nthreads This inventiveness on the part of the bobbin or pillow\nworkers reacted upon the needlepoint workers, who in their turn\nproduced still more delicate grounds with meshes of single and double\ntwisted threads Lace, passing from stage to stage, thus became a filmy tissue or fabric,\nand its original use as a somewhat stiff, wiry-looking trimming to\nlinen consequently changed Larger articles than borders, collars, and\ncuffs were made of the new filmy material, and lace flounces, veils,\nloose sleeves, curtains, and bed-covers were produced This transition\nmay be traced through the first hundred and twenty years of lace-\nmaking It culminated during the succeeding ninety years in a\ndevelopment \nof \nfanciful \npattern-making, \nin \nwhich \nrealistic\nrepresentation of flowers, trees, cupids, warriors, sportsmen, animals\nof the chase, emblems of all sorts, rococo and architectural ornament,\nis typical Whilst the eighteenth century may perhaps be regarded as a\nperiod of questionable propriety in the employment of ornament\nhardly appropriate to the twisting, plaiting, and looping together of\nthreads, it is nevertheless notable for tours de force in lace-making\nachieved without regard to cost or trouble From this stage, the climax\nof which may be placed about 1760, the designing of lace patterns\ndeclined; and from the end of the eighteenth to the first twenty years\nor so of the nineteenth centuries, laces, although still made with the\nneedle and bobbins, became little more than finely-meshed nets\npowdered over with dots or leaves, or single blossoms, or tiny sprays Within the limits of a brief note like the present, it is not possible to\ndiscuss local peculiarities in methods of work and styles of design\nwhich established the characters of the various Venetian and other\nItalian points, of the French points of Alençon and Argentan, of the\ncloudy Valenciennes, Mechlin, and Brussels laces Neither can one\ntouch upon the nurturing of the industry by nuns in convents, by\n\n\nworkers subsidised by State grants, and so forth It would require\nmore space than is available to fairly discuss what styles of ornament\nare least or most suited to lace-making; or whether lace is less rightly\nemployed as a tissue for the making of entire articles of costume or of\nhousehold use, than as an ornamental accessory or trimming to\ncostume Whilst very much lace is a fantastic adjunct to costume, serving a\npurpose sometimes like that of appoggiature and fioriture in music,\nother lace, such as the carved-ivory-looking scrolls of Venetian raised\npoints, which are principally associated with the jabots and ruffles of\nkings, ministers, and marshals, and with the ornamentation of priests'\nvestments, is certainly more dignified in character The loops, twists,\nand plaits of threads are more noticeable in laces of comparatively\nsmall dimensions than they are in laces of great size Size rather\ntempts the lace-worker to strive for ready effect, and to sacrifice the\nminuteness and finish of hand work, which give quality of\npreciousness to lace The via media to this quality lies between two\nextremes; namely, applying dainty threads to the interpretation of\nbadly shaped and ill-grouped forms on the one hand, and on the other\nhand adopting a style of ornament which depends upon largeness of\ndetail and massiveness in grouping, and is therefore unsuited to lace Without finish of handicraft, producing beautiful ornament suited to\nthe material in which it is expressed, lace worthy the name cannot be\nmade The industry is still pursued in France, Belgium, Venice, Austria,\nBohemia, and Ireland Honiton has acquired a notoriety for its pillow\nlaces, many of which some hundred years ago were as varied and well\nexecuted as Brussels pillow laces Other English towns in the Midland\ncounties followed the lead chiefly of Mechlin, Valenciennes, Lille, and\nArras, but were rarely as successful as their leaders Saxony, Russia,\nand the Auvergne produce quantities of pillow laces, having little\npretence to design, though capable of pretty effects when artistically\nworn There is no question that the want of a sustained intelligence in\nappreciating ingenious hand-made laces has told severely upon the\nindustry; and as with other artistic handicrafts, so with lace-making,\nmachinery has very considerably supplanted the hand There is at\npresent a limited revival in the demand for hand-made laces, and\nefforts are made at certain centres to give new life to the industry by\ninfusing into it artistic feeling derived from a study of work done\n\n\nduring the periods when the art flourished Alan S Cole OF BOOK ILLUSTRATION AND BOOK\nDECORATION\nBook illustration is supposed to have made a great advance in the last\nfew years No doubt it has, but this advance has not been made on\nany definite principle, but, as it were, in and out of a network of\ncross-purposes No attempt has been made to classify illustration in\nrelation to the purpose it has to fulfil Broadly speaking, this purpose is threefold It is either utilitarian, or\npartly utilitarian partly artistic, or purely artistic",
    "It is either utilitarian, or\npartly utilitarian partly artistic, or purely artistic The first may be\ndismissed at once Such drawings as technical diagrams must be clear\nand accurate, but by their very nature they are non-artistic, and in\nregard to art it is a case of \"hands off\" to the draughtsman Illustration as an art, that is, book decoration, begins with the second\nclass From this standpoint an illustration involves something more\nthan mere drawing In the first place, the drawing must illustrate the\nsubject, but as the drawing will not be set in a plain mount, but\nsurrounded or bordered by printed type, there is the further problem\nof the relation of the drawing to the printed type The relative\nimportance attached to the printed type or the drawing is the crucial\npoint for the illustrator If all his thoughts are concentrated on his\nown drawing, one line to him will be much as another; but if he\nconsiders his illustration as going with the type to form one\nhomogeneous design, each line becomes a matter of deliberate\nintention Now, in the early days of printing, when both type and illustration\nwere printed off a single block, the latter standpoint was adopted as a\nmatter of course, and as the art developed and men of genuine ability\napplied themselves to design, this intimate relation between printer\nand designer produced results of inimitable beauty Each page of a\nfine Aldine is a work of art in itself The eye can run over page after\npage for the simple pleasure of its decoration No black blots in a sea\nof ignoble type break the quiet dignity of the page; each part of it\nworks together with the rest for one premeditated harmony But\ngradually, with the severance of the arts, the printer lost sight of the\nartist, and the latter cared only for himself; and there came the\n\n\ninevitable result which has followed this selfishness in all the other\narts of design Printing ceased to be an art at all, and the art of book\ndecoration died of neglect; the illustrator made his drawing without\nthought of the type, and left it to the printer to pitch it into the text,\nand reproduce it as best he could The low-water mark in artistic illustration was reached perhaps in the\nearly part of this century, and the greatest offender was Turner\nhimself The illustrations which Turner made for Rogers's Poems show\nno sort of modification of his habitual practice in painting They may\nhave been beautiful in themselves, but it evidently never entered into\nTurner's head that the method, which was admirable in a picture\naided by all the resources of colour, was beside the mark when\napplied to the printed page with all the limitations of black and white\nand the simple line One looks in vain in Turner's illustrations for any\nevidence that he was conscious of the existence of the rest of the page\nat all Something more than a landscape painter's knowledge of\ndrawing is necessary The custom of getting illustrations from painters\nwho have little knowledge of decorative design has led to the\ninvention of all sorts of mechanical processes in order to transfer\neasel-work direct to the printed page The effect of this upon book\ndecoration has been deadly Process-work of this sort has gone far to\nkill wood-engraving; and as to its result, instead of a uniform texture\nof line woven as it were over the entire page, the eye is arrested by\nharsh patches of black or gray which show a disregard of the printed\ntype which is little less than brutal Leaving recent work out of\naccount, one exception only can be made, and that is in the case of\nWilliam Blake The inherent conditions of book decoration point to the line drawn by\nhand, and reproduced, either by wood-engraving or by direct\nfacsimile process, as its proper method Indeed, the ideal of paginal\nbeauty would be reached by leaving both the text and the illustrative\ndesign to hand, if not to one hand This, however, is out of the\nquestion; the cost alone is prohibitive The point for the book-\ndecorator to consider is, what sort of line will range best with the\ntype In the case of the second division of our classification, which, in\ndefault of a better name, may be called \"record work,\" it is impossible\nto apply to the line the amount of abstraction and selection which\nwould be necessary in pure design To do so, for instance, in the case\nof an architectural illustration, would destroy the \"vraisemblance\"\n\n\nwhich is of the essence of such a drawing Even in this case, however,\nthe line ought to be very carefully considered It is important to\nrecollect that the type establishes a sort of scale of its own, and,\ntaking ordinary lettering, this would exclude very minute work where\nthe lines are close together and there is much cross-hatching; and also\nsimple outline work such as Retsch used to labour at, for the latter\nerrs on the side of tenuity and meagreness as much as process-\nreproduction of brush-work sins in the opposite extreme The line\nused in architectural illustration should be free, accurate, and\nunfaltering, drawn with sufficient technical knowledge of architecture\nto enable the draughtsman to know where he can stop without injury\nto his subject The line should not be obstinate, but so light and subtle\nas to reflect without effort each thought that flits across the artist's\nmind Vierge has shown how much can be done in this way With a\nfew free lines and the contrast of some dark piece of shading in\nexactly the right place, he will often tell you more of a subject than\nwill the most elaborately finished picture This is the method to aim at\nin architectural illustration The poetry of architecture and its highest\nqualities of dignity of mass and outline are smothered by that\nlaborious accuracy which covers every part of the drawing with a vain\nrepetition of unfeeling lines Where, however, the illustration is purely imaginative, the decorative\nstandpoint should be kept steadily in view, and the process of\nselection and abstraction carried very much farther Here, at length,\nthe illustrator can so order his design that the drawing and the printed\ntype form a single piece of decoration, not disregarding the type, but\nusing it as in itself a means of obtaining texture and scale and\ndistributed effect The type is, as it were, the technical datum of the\ndesign, which determines the scale of the line to be used with it With\na wiry type no doubt a wiry drawing is desirable, but the types of the\ngreat periods of printing are firm in outline and large and ample in\ndistribution Assuming, then, that one of these types can be used, the\nline of the accompanying design should be strongly drawn, and\ndesigned from end to end with full allowance for the white paper No\nbetter model can be followed than Dürer's woodcuts The amount of\nwork which Dürer would get out of a single line is something\nextraordinary, and perhaps to us impossible; for in view of our\ncomplex modern ideas and total absence of tradition, probably no\nmodern designer can hope to attain to the great German's magnificent\n\n\ndirectness and tremendous intensity of expression Deliberate selection, both in subject and treatment, becomes therefore\na matter of the first importance The designer should reject subjects\nwhich do not admit of a decorative treatment His business is not with\nscience, or morals, but with art for its own sake; he should, therefore,\nselect his subject with a single eye to its artistic possibilities As to the\nline itself, it is impossible to offer any suggestion, for the line used is\nas much a part of the designer's idea as the words of a poem are of a\npoet's poetry; and the invention of these must come of itself But once\nin consciousness, the line must be put under rigid control as simply a\nmeans of expression There is an insidious danger in the line Designers sometimes seem to be inebriated with their own cunning;\nthey go on drawing line after line, apparently for the simple pleasure\nof deftly placing them side by side, or at best to produce some\nspurious imitation of texture As soon as the line is made an end in\nitself, it becomes a wearisome thing The use of the line and the\nimitation of texture should be absolutely subordinated to the\ndecorative purposes of the design, and the neglect of this rule is as\nbad art as if a musician, from perverse delight in the intricacies of a\nfugue, were to lose his theme in a chaos of counterpoint If, then, to conclude, we are to return to the best traditions of book\ndecoration, the artist must abandon the selfish isolation in which he\nhas hitherto worked He must regard the printed type not as a\nnecessary evil, but as a valuable material for the decoration of the\npage, and the type and the illustration should be considered in strict\nrelation to each other This will involve a self-restraint far more rigid\nthan any required in etching, because the point to be aimed at is not\nso much the direct suggestion of nature, as the best decorative\ntreatment of the line in relation to the entire page Thus, to the skill of\nthe draughtsman must be added the far-seeing imagination of the\ndesigner, which, instead of being content with a hole-and-corner\nsuccess, involving disgrace to the rest of the page, embraces in its\nconsciousness all the materials available for the beautification of the\npage as a whole It is only by this severe intellectual effort, by this\nself-abnegation, by this ready acceptance of the union of the arts, that\nthe art of book illustration can again attain to a permanent value",
    "It is only by this severe intellectual effort, by this\nself-abnegation, by this ready acceptance of the union of the arts, that\nthe art of book illustration can again attain to a permanent value Reginald Blomfield OF DESIGNS AND WORKING DRAWINGS\nThe drawings which most deeply interest the workman are working\ndrawings—just the last to be appreciated by the public, because they\nare the last to be understood The most admired of show drawings are\nto us craftsmen comparatively without interest We recognise the\n\"competition\" drawing at once; we see how it was made in order to\nsecure the commission, not with a view to its effect in execution\n(which is the true and only end of a design), and we do not wonder at\nthe failure of competitions in general For the man who cares least, if\neven he knows at all, how a design will appear in execution is the\nmost likely to perpetrate a prettiness which may gain the favour of\nthe inexpert, with whom the selection is likely to rest The general public, and all in fact who are technically ignorant on the\nsubject, need to be warned that the most attractive and what are\ncalled \"taking\" drawings are just those which are least likely to be\ndesigns—still less bonâ fide working drawings The real workman has\nnot the time, even if he had the inclination, to \"finish up\" his drawings\nto the point that is generally considered pleasing; the inventive spirit\nhas not the patience We have each of us the failings complementary\nto our faculties, and vice versâ; and you will usually find—certainly it\nis my experience—that the makers of very elaborately finished\ndrawings seldom do anything but what we have often seen before;\nand that men of any individuality, actual designers that is to say, have\na way of considering a drawing finished as soon as ever it expresses\nwhat they mean You may take it, then, as a general rule that highly finished and\nelaborate drawings are got up for show, \"finished for exhibition\" as\nthey say (in compliance with the supposed requirements of an\nexhibition rather than with a view to practical purposes), and that\ndrawings completed only so far as is necessary, precise in their details,\ndisfigured by notes in writing, sections, and so on, are at least genuine\nworkaday designs If you ask what a design should be like—well, like a design It is\naltogether a different thing from a picture; it is almost the reverse of\nit Practically no man has, as I said, the leisure, even if he had the\n\n\nability, to make an effective finished picture of a thing yet to be\ncarried out—perhaps not to be carried out This last is a most serious\nconsideration for him, and may have a sad effect upon his work The\nartist who could afford thus to give himself away gratis would\ncertainly not do so; the man who might be willing to do it could not;\nfor if he has \"got no work to do\"—that is at least presumptive\nevidence that he is not precisely a master of his craft The design that looks like a picture is likely to be at best a\nreminiscence of something done before; and the more often it has\nbeen done the more likely it is to be pictorially successful—and by so\nmuch the less is it, strictly speaking, a design This applies especially to designs on a small scale, such as are usually\nsubmitted to catch the rare commission To imitate in a full-sized\ncartoon the texture of material, the casualty of reflected light, and\nother such accidents of effect, is sheer nonsense, and no practical\nworkman would think of such a thing A painter put to the\nuncongenial task of decorative design might be excused for\nattempting to make his productions pass muster by workmanship\nexcellent in itself, although not in the least to the point: one does\nwhat one can, or what one must; and if a man has a faculty he needs\nmust show it Only, the perfection of painting will not, for all that,\nmake design In the first small sketch-design, everything need not of course be\nexpressed; but it should be indicated—for the purpose is simply to\nexplain the scheme proposed: so much of pictorial representation as\nmay be necessary to that is desirable, and no more It should be in the\nnature of a diagram, specific enough to illustrate the idea and how it\nis to be worked out It ought by strict rights to commit one definitely\nto a certain method of execution, as a written specification would; and\nmay often with advantage be helped out by written notes, which\nexplain more definitely than any pictorial rendering just how this is to\nbe wrought, that cast, the other chased, and so on, as the case may be Whatever the method of expression the artist may adopt, he should be\nperfectly clear in his own mind how his design is to be worked out;\nand he ought to make it clear also to any one with sufficient technical\nknowledge to understand a drawing In the first sketch for a window, for example, he need not show every\n\n\nlead and every piece of glass; but there should be no possible mistake\nas to how it is to be glazed, or which is \"painted\" glass and which is\n\"mosaic \" To omit the necessary bars in a sketch for glass seems to me\na weak concession to the prejudice of the public One may have to\nconcede such points sometimes; but the concession is due less to\nnecessity than to the—what shall we call it —not perhaps exactly the\ncowardice, but at all events the timidity, of the artist In a full-sized working drawing or cartoon everything material to the\ndesign should be expressed, and that as definitely as possible In a\ncartoon for glass (to take again the same example) every lead-line\nshould be shown, as well as the saddle bars; to omit them is about as\nexcusable as it would be to leave out the sections from a design for\ncabinet work It is contended sometimes that such details are not\nnecessary, that the artist can bear all that in mind Doubtless he can,\nmore or less; but I am inclined to believe more strongly in the less At\nany rate he will much more certainly have them in view whilst he\nkeeps them visibly before his eyes One thing that deters him is the\nfear of offending the client, who will not believe, when he sees leads\nand bars in a drawing, how little they are likely to assert themselves\nin the glass Very much the same thing applies to designs and working drawings\ngenerally A thorough craftsman never suggests a form or colour\nwithout realising in his own mind how he will be able to get such\nform or colour in the actual work; and in his working drawing he\nexplains that fully, making allowance even for some not impossible\ndulness of apprehension on the part of the executant Thus, if a\npattern is to be woven he indicates the cards to be employed, he\narranges what parts are \"single,\" what \"double,\" as the weavers call it,\nwhat changes in the shuttle are proposed, and by the crossing of\nwhich threads certain intermediate tints are to be obtained Or again, if the design is for wall-paper printing, he arranges not only\nfor the blocks, but the order in which they shall be printed; and\nprovides for possible printing in \"flock,\" or for the printing of one\ntransparent colour over another, so as to get more colours than there\nare blocks used, and so on In either case, too, he shows quite plainly the limits of each colour,\nnot so much seeking the softness of effect which is his ultimate aim,\n\n\nas the precision which will enable the block or card cutter to see at a\nglance what he means,—even at the risk of a certain hardness in his\ndrawing; for the drawing is in itself of no account; it is only the means\nto an end; and his end is the stuff, the paper, or whatever it may be,\nin execution A workman intent on his design will sacrifice his drawing to it—\nharden it, as I said, for the sake of emphasis, annotate it, patch it, cut\nit up into pieces to prove it, if need be do anything to make his\nmeaning clear to the workman who comes after him It is as a rule\nonly the dilettante who is dainty about preserving his drawings To an artist very much in repute there may be some temptation to be\ncareful of his designs, and to elaborate them (himself, or by the hands\nof his assistants), because, so finished, they have a commercial value\nas drawings—but this is at best pot-boiling; and the only men who are\nsubject to this temptation are just those who might be proof against it Men of such rank that even their working drawings are in demand\nhave no very urgent need to work for the pot; and the working\ndrawings of men to whom pounds and shillings must needs be a real\nconsideration are not sought after In the case of very smart and highly finished drawings by\ncomparatively unknown designers—of ninety-nine out of a hundred,\nthat is to say, or nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand\nperhaps—elaboration implies either that, having little to say, a man\nfills up his time in saying it at unnecessary length, or that he is\nworking for exhibition And why not work for exhibition it may be asked There is a simple\nanswer to that: The exhibition pitch is in much too high a key, and in\nthe long run it will ruin the faculty of the workman who adopts it It is only fair to admit that an exhibition of fragmentary and\nunfinished drawings, soiled, tattered, and torn, as they almost\ninvariably come from the workshop or factory, would make a very\npoor show—which may be an argument against exhibiting them at all Certainly it is a reason for mending, cleaning, and mounting them,\nand putting them in some sort of frame (for what is not worth the\npains of making presentable is not worth showing), but that is a very\ndifferent thing from working designs up to picture pitch When all is said, designs, if exhibited, appeal primarily to designers We all want to see each other's work, and especially each other's way\nof working; but it should not be altogether uninteresting to the\nintelligent amateur to see what working drawings are, and to compare\nthem with the kind of specious competition drawings by which he is\nso apt to be misled Lewis F Day FURNITURE AND THE ROOM\nThe art of furnishing runs on two wheels—the room and the furniture As in the bicycle, the inordinate development of one wheel at the\nexpense of its colleague has been not without some great feats, yet too\noften has provoked catastrophe; so furnishing makes safest\nprogression when, with a juster proportion, its two wheels are kept to\nmoderate and uniform diameters The room should be for the\nfurniture just as much as the furniture for the room Of late it has not been so; we have been indulging in the\n\"disproportionately wheeled\" type, and the result has been to crowd\nour rooms, and reduce them to insignificance Even locomotion in\nthem is often embarrassing, especially when the upholsterer has been\nallowed carte blanche But, apart from this, there is a sense of repletion\nin these masses of chattel—miscellanies brought together with no\nsubordination to each other, or to the effect of the room as a whole Taken in the single piece, our furniture is sometimes not without its\nmerit, but it is rarely exempt from self-assertion, or, to use a slang\nterm, \"fussiness \" And an aggregation of \"fussinesses\" becomes\nfatiguing One is betrayed into uncivilised longings for the workhouse,\nor even the convict's cell, the simplicity of bare boards and tables But we must not use our dictum for aggressive purposes merely, faulty\nas modern systems may be In the distinction of the two sides of the\nproblem of furnishing—the room for the furniture, and the furniture\nfor the room—there is some historical significance Under these titles\nmight be written respectively the first and last chapters in the history\nof this art—its rise and its decadence Furniture in the embryonic state of chests, which held the possessions\nof early times, and served, as they moved from place to place, for\ntables, chairs, and wardrobes, may have been in existence while the\ntents and sheds which accommodated them were of less value But\nfurnishing began with settled architecture, when the room grew first\ninto importance, and overshadowed its contents The art of the\nbuilder had soared far beyond the ambitions of the furnisher Later, the two constituents of our art came to be produced\nsimultaneously, and under one impulse of design The room, whether\n\n\nchurch or hall, had now its specific furniture In the former this was\nadapted for ritual, in the latter for feasting; but in both the contents\nformed in idea an integral part of the interior in which they stood And while these conditions endured, the art was in its palmy state Later, furniture came to be considered apart from its position It grew\nfanciful and fortuitous The problem of fitting it to the room was no\nproblem at all while both sprang from a common conception: it\nbecame so when its independent design, at first a foible of luxury,\ngrew to be a necessity of production As long, however, as\narchitecture remained dominant, and painting and sculpture were its\nacknowledged vassals, furniture retained its legitimate position and\nshared in their triumphs But when these the elder sisters shook off\ntheir allegiance, furniture followed suit It developed the self-assertion\nof which we have spoken, and, in the belief that it could stand alone,\ndivorced itself from that support which was the final cause of its\nexistence There have been doubtless many slackenings and\ntightenings of the chain which links the arts of design together; but it\nis to be noted how with each slackening furniture grew gorgeous and\nartificial, failed to sympathise with common needs, and sank slowly\nbut surely into feebleness and insipidity We had passed through some such cycle by the middle of this century With the dissolution of old ties the majority of the decorative arts had\nperished Painting remained to us, arrogating to herself the rôle which\nhitherto the whole company had combined to make successful In her\nstruggle to fill the giant's robe, she has run unresistingly in the ruts of\nthe age She has crowded her portable canvases, side by side, into\nexhibitions and galleries, and claimed the title of art for literary rather\nthan æsthetic suggestions The minor coquetries of craftsmanship,\nfrom which once was nourished the burly strength of art, have felt out\nof place in such illustrious company So we have the forced art of\npublic display, but it has ceased to be the habit in which our common\nrooms and homely walls could be dressed The attendant symptom has been the loss from our houses of all that\narchitectural amalgam, which in former times blended the structure\nwith its contents, the screens and panellings, which, half room, half\nfurniture, cemented the one to the other The eighteenth century\ncarried on the tradition to a great extent with plinth and dado, cornice\nand encrusted ceiling; but by the middle of the nineteenth we had our\n\n\ninteriors handed over to us by the architect almost completely void of\narchitectural feature We are asked to take as a substitute, what is\nnaïvely called \"decoration,\" two coats of paint, and a veneer of\nmachine-printed wall-papers In this progress of obliteration an important factor has been the\nincreasing brevity of our tenures Three or four times in twenty years\nthe outgoing tenant will make good his dilapidations, and the house-\nagent will put the premises into tenantable repair—as these things are\nsettled for us by lawyers and surveyors After a series of such\nprocesses, what can remain of internal architecture Can there be left\neven a room worth furnishing, in the true sense of the term The first\nstep to render it so must usually be the obliteration of as much as\npossible of the maimed and distorted construction, which our\nleasehold house offers What wonder, then, if furniture, beginning again to account herself an\nart, should have transgressed her limits and invaded the room Ceilings, walls and floors, chimneypieces, grates, doors and windows,\nall nowadays come into the hands of the artistic furnisher, and are at\nthe mercy of upholsterers and cabinetmakers to begin with, and of the\nantiquity-collector to follow Then we bring in our gardens, and finish\noff our drawing-room as a mixture of a conservatory and a bric-à-brac\nshop The fashion for archæological mimicry has been another pitfall The\nattempt to bring back art by complete reproductions of old-day\nfurnishings has been much the vogue abroad The Parisians\ndistinguish many styles and affect to carry them out in every detail The Americans have copied Paris, and we have done a little ourselves But the weak element in all this is, that the occupier of these\nmediæval or classic apartments remains still the nineteenth-century\nembodiment, which we meet in railway carriage and omnibus We\ncannot be cultured Epicureans in a drawing-room of the Roman\nEmpire, and by the opening of a door walk as Flemish Burgomasters\ninto our libraries The heart of the age will mould its productions\nirrespective of fashion or archæology, and such miserable shams fail\nto reach it If we, who live in this century, can at all ourselves appraise the\nposition, its most essential characteristic in its bearing upon art has\n\n\nbeen the commercial tendency Thereby an indelible stamp is set upon\nour furniture The making of it under the supreme condition of\nprofitable sale has affected it in both its functions On the side of\nutility our furniture has been shaped to the uses of the million, not of\nthe individual Hence its monotonously average character, its failure\nto become part of ourselves, its lack of personal and local charm",

profit, but the customer is just\nwhere he was It may be granted that a genuine necessity of sale is the\nstimulus to which all serious effort in the arts must look for progress,\nand without which they would become faddism and conceit But it is\na different thing altogether when this passes from stimulus into\nmotive—the exclusive motive of profit to the producer The worth of\nthe article is impaired as much as the well-being of the craftsman, and\nfurniture is degraded to the position of a pawn in the game of the\nsweater We must, I fear, be content at present to put up with exhibitions and\nunarchitectural rooms But while making the best of these conditions,\nwe need not acquiesce in them or maintain their permanence At any\nrate we may fight a good fight with commercialism The evils of\nheartless and unloving production, under the grind of an unnecessary\ngreed, are patent enough to lead us to reflect that we have after all in\nthese matters a choice We need not spend our money on that which\nis not bread We can go for our furniture to the individual craftsman\nand not the commercial firm The penalty for so doing is no longer\nprohibitive In closing our remarks we cannot do better than repeat our initial\naxiom—the art of furnishing lies with the room as much as with the\nfurniture The old ways are still the only ways When we care for art\nsufficiently to summon her from her state prison-house of exhibitions\n\n\nand galleries, to live again a free life among us in our homes, she will\nappear as a controlling force, using not only painting and sculpture,\nbut all the decorative arts to shape room and furniture under one\npurpose of design Whether we shall then give her the time-honoured\ntitle of architecture, or call her by another name, is of no moment Edward S Prior OF THE ROOM AND FURNITURE\nThe transient tenure that most of us have in our dwellings, and the\nabsorbing nature of the struggle that most of us have to make to win\nthe necessary provisions of life, prevent our encouraging the\nmanufacture of well-wrought furniture We mean to outgrow our houses—our lease expires after so many\nyears and then we shall want an entirely different class of furniture;\nconsequently we purchase articles that have only sufficient life in\nthem to last the brief period of our occupation, and are content to\nabide by the want of appropriateness or beauty, in the clear intention\nof some day surrounding ourselves with objects that shall be joys to us\nfor the remainder of our life Another deterrent condition to making a\nserious outlay in furniture is the instability of fashion: each decade\nsees a new style, and the furniture that we have acquired in the\nexercise of our experienced taste will in all probability be discarded\nby the impetuous purism of the succeeding generation At present we are suffering from such a catholicity of taste as sees\ngood in everything, and has an indifferent and tepid appreciation of\nall and sundry, especially if consecrated by age This is mainly a reaction against the austerity of those moralists who\npreached the logic of construction, and who required outward proof\nof the principles on which and by which each piece was designed Another cause prejudicial to the growth of modern furniture is the\ncanonisation of old That tables and chairs should have lasted one hundred years is indeed\nproof that they were originally well made: that the conditions of the\nmoment of their make were better than they are now is possible, and\nsuch aureole as is their due let us hasten to offer But, to take\nadvantage of their survival and to increase their number by facsimile\nreproduction is to paralyse all healthy growth of manufacture As an answer to the needs and habits of our ancestors of one hundred\nyears ago—both in construction and design—let them serve us as\nmodels showing the attitude of mind in which we should meet the\n\n\nproblems of our day—and so far as the needs and habits of the present\ntime are unchanged, as models of form, not to be incorporated with\nour vernacular, but which we should recognise as successful form, and\ndiscover the plastic secrets of its shape With this possession we may borrow what forms we will—shapes of\nthe Ind and far Cathay—the whole wide world is open to us—of past\nimaginations and of the dreams of our own But without this master-key the copying is slavish, and the bondage of\nthe task is both cruel and destructive Cruel, because mindless, work can be reproduced more rapidly than\nthoughtful work can be invented, and the rate of production affects\nthe price of other articles of similar kind, so that the one dictates what\nthe other shall receive; and destructive, because it treats the craftsman\nas a mere machine, whose only standard can be mechanical\nexcellence Now, all furniture that has any permanent value has been designed\nand wrought to meet the ends it had to serve, and the careful\nelaboration of it gave its maker scope for his pleasure and occasion for\nhis pride If a man really likes what he has got to do, he will make great shifts to\nexpress and realise his pleasure; he will choose carefully his materials,\nand either in playfulness of fancy, or in grave renunciation of the\ngarniture of his art, will put the stamp of his individuality on his\nwork An example of living art in modern furniture is a costermonger's\nbarrow Affectionately put together, carved and painted, it expresses\nalmost in words the pride and taste of its owner As long as we are incapable of recognising and sympathising with the\ndelight of the workman in the realisation of his art, our admiration of\nhis work is a pretence, and our encouragement of it blind—and this\nblindness makes us insensitive as to whether the delight is really there\nor no; consequently our patronage will most often be disastrous rather\nthan helpful The value of furniture depends on the directness of its response to the\nrequirements that called it into being, and to the nature of the\n\n\nconditions that evoked it To obtain good furniture we must contrive that the conditions of its\nservice are worthy conditions, and not merely the dictates of our\nfancy or our sloth At the present moment modern furniture may be roughly divided into\ntwo classes: furniture for service, and furniture for display Most of us,\nhowever, have to confine ourselves to the possession of serviceable\nfurniture only; and a more frank recognition of this limitation would\nassist us greatly in our selection If only we kept our real needs\nsteadily before us, how much more beauty we could import into our\nhomes Owing to lack of observation, and of experienced canons of taste, our\nfancies are caught by some chance object that pleases—one of that\nhuge collection of ephemeral articles which \"have been created to\nsupply a want\" that hitherto has never been felt—and as the cost of\nthese fictions is (by the nature of the case) so low as to be of no great\nmoment to us, the thing is purchased and helps henceforth to swell\nthe museum of incongruous accumulation that goes by the name of a\n\"furnished drawing-room \"\nA fancy, so caught, is soon outworn, but the precept of economy\nforbids the discharge of the superfluous purchase, and so it adds its\nunit to the sum of daily labour spent on its preservation and its\nappearance This burden of unnecessary toil is the index of the\nneedlessness and cruelty with which we spend the labour of those\nwhom need has put under our service And the sum of money spent on these ill-considered acquisitions\nwhich have gone to swell the general total of distress, an ever-\nwidening ring of bitter ripple, might, concentrated, have purchased\nsome one thing, both beautiful and useful, whose fashioning had been\na pleasure to the artificer, and whose presence was an increasing\ndelight to the owner and an added unit to this world's real wealth Such indiscriminate collection defeats its own aim",
    "Such indiscriminate collection defeats its own aim Compare the way\nGiovanni Bellini fits up St Jerome's study for him in the National\nGallery There is no stint of money evidently; the Saint gets all that he\ncan properly want, and he gets over and above—the addition born of\nhis denial—the look of peace and calm in his room, that can so\n\n\nseldom be found with us Another reason why our rooms are so\nglaringly over-furnished is, that many of us aim at a standard of\nprofusion, in forgetfulness of the circumstances which created that\nstandard Families, whose descent has been historic, and whose home\nhas been their pride, accumulate, in the lapse of time, heirlooms of\nmany kinds—pictures, furniture, trinkets, etc —and as these increase\nin numbers, the rooms in which they are contained become filled and\ncrowded beyond what beauty or comfort permits, and such sacrifice is\njustly made for the demands of filial pride This emotion is so conspicuously an honourable one that we are all\neager to possess and give scope to our own, and so long as the scope is\nhonest there is nothing more laudable But the temptation is to add to our uninherited display in this\nparticular \nby \nsubstitutes, \nand \nto \nsurround \nourselves \nwith\nimmemorable articles, the justification of whose presence really\nshould be that they form part of the history of our lives in more\nimportant respects than the mere occasions of their purchase It is this unreasoning ambition that leads to the rivalling of princely\nhouses by the acquisition of \"family portraits purchased in Wardour\nStreet\"—the rivalling of historic libraries by the purchase of thousands\nof books to form our yesterday's libraries of undisturbed volumes—the\nrivalling of memorable chairs and tables, by recently bought articles\nof our own, crowded in imitation of our model with innumerable\ntrifles, to the infinite tax of our space, our patience, and our purse Our want of care and restraint in the selection of our furniture affects\nboth its design and manufacture Constantly articles are bought for temporary use—we postponing the\nresponsibility of wise purchase until we have more time, or else we\nbuy what is not precisely what we want but which must do, since we\ncannot wait to have the exact things made, and have not the time to\nsearch elsewhere for them Furniture, in response to this demand, must be made either so striking\nas to arrest the eye, or so variedly serviceable as to meet some\nconsiderable proportion of the conflicting requirements made on it by\nthe chance intending purchaser, or else it must fall back on the\nimpregnable basis of antiquity and silence all argument with the\n\n\ncanon that what the late Mr Chippendale did was bound to be \"good\ntaste \"\n\"There should be a place for everything, and everything in its place \"\nVery true But in the exercise of our orderliness we require the hearty\nco-operation of the \"place\" itself 'Tis a wonderful aid when the place\nfits the object it is intended to contain Take the common male chest of drawers as a case in point Its\nfunction is to hold a man's shirts and his clothes, articles of a known\nand constant size Why are the drawers not made proportionate for\ntheir duty Why are they so few and so deep that when filled—as they\nneeds must be—they are uneasy to draw out, and to obtain the\nparticular article of which we are in quest, and which of course is at\nthe bottom, we must burrow into the heavy super-incumbent mass of\nclothes in our search, and—that successful—spend a weary while in\ncontriving to repack the ill-disposed space It can hardly be economy\nof labour and material that dictates this, for—if so—why is the usual\nhanging wardrobe made so preposterously too tall Does the idiot\nmaker suppose that a woman's dress is hung all in one piece, body\nand skirt, from the nape of the neck, to trail its extremest length The art of buying furniture, or having it made for us, is to be acquired\nonly by study and pains, and we must either pursue the necessary\neducation, or depute the furnishing of our rooms to competent hands:\nand the responsibility does not end here, for there is the duty of\ndiscovering who are competent, and this must be done indirectly since\ndirect inquiry only elicits the one criterion, omnipotent, omnipresent,\nof cost The object to be gained in furnishing a room is to supply the just\nrequirements of the occupants, to accentuate or further the character\nof the room, and to indicate the individual habits and tastes of the\nowner Each piece should be beautiful in itself, and, still more important,\nshould minister to and increase the beauty of the others Collective\nbeauty is to be aimed at;

    "Halsey Ricardo THE ENGLISH TRADITION\nThe sense of a consecutive tradition has so completely faded out of\nEnglish art that it has become difficult to realise the meaning of\ntradition, or the possibility of its ever again reviving; and this state of\nthings is not improved by the fact that it is due to uncertainty of\npurpose, and not to any burning fever of individualism Tradition in\nart is a matter of environment, of intellectual atmosphere As the\nresult of many generations of work along one continuous line, there\nhas accumulated a certain amount of ability in design and manual\ndexterity, certain ideas are in the air, certain ways of doing things\ncome to be recognised as the right ways To all this endowment an\nartist born in any of the living ages of art succeeded as a matter of\ncourse, and it is the absence of this inherited knowledge that places\nthe modern craftsman under exceptional disabilities There is evidence to prove the existence in England of hereditary\ncrafts in which the son succeeded the father for generations, and to\nshow that the guilds were rather the guardians of high traditional skill\nthan mere trades unions; but there is surer proof of a common thread\nof tradition in certain qualities all along the line, which gave to\nEnglish work a character peculiar to itself Instances of genuine Gothic\nfurniture are rare; in England at any rate it was usually simple and\nsolid, sufficient to answer the needs of an age without any highly\ndeveloped sense of the luxuries of life It is not till the Renaissance\nthat much material can be found for a history of English furniture Much of the motif of this work came from Italy and the Netherlands;\nindeed cabinet work was imported largely from the latter country It\nwas just here, however, that tradition stepped in, and gave to our\nsixteenth and seventeenth century furniture a distinctly national\ncharacter The delicate mouldings, the skilful turnings, the quiet\ninlays of ebony, ivory, cherry wood, and walnut, above all the breadth\nand sobriety of its design, point to a tradition of craftsmanship strong\nenough to assimilate all the ideas which it borrowed from other ages\nand other countries Contrast, for instance, a piece of Tottenham\nCourt Road marquetry with the mother-of-pearl and ebony inlay on an\nEnglish cabinet at South Kensington So far as mere skill in cutting\ngoes there may be no great difference between the two, but the latter\n\n\nis charming, and the former tedious in the last degree; and the reason\nis that in the seventeenth century the craftsman loved his work, and\nwas master of it He started with an idea in his head, and used his\nmaterial with meaning, and so his inlay is as fanciful as the seaweed,\nand yet entirely subordinated to the harmony of the whole design Perhaps some of the best furniture work ever done in England was\ndone between 1600 and 1660 I refer, of course, to the good\nexamples, to work which depended for its effect on refined design and\ndelicate detail, not to the bulbous legs and coarse carving of ordinary\nElizabethan, though even this had a naïveté and spontaneity entirely\nlacking in modern reproductions After the Restoration, signs of French influence appear in English\nfurniture, but the tradition of structural fitness and dignity of design\nwas preserved through the great architectural age of Wren and Gibbs,\nand lasted till the latter half of the eighteenth century If that century\nwas not particularly inspired, it at least understood consummate\nworkmanship The average of technical skill in the handicrafts was far\nin advance of the ordinary trade work of the present day Some\ncurious evidences of the activity prevailing in what are called the\nminor arts may be found in The Laboratory and School of Arts, a small\noctavo volume published in 1738 The work of this period furnishes a\nstanding instance of the value of tradition By the beginning of the\neighteenth century a school of carvers had grown up in England who\ncould carve, with absolute precision and without mechanical aids, all\nsuch ornament as egg and tongue work, or the acanthus, and other\nconventional foliage used for the decoration of the mouldings of\ndoors, mantelpieces, and the like Grinling Gibbons is usually named\nas the founder of this school, but Gibbons was himself trained by such\nmen as Wren and Gibbs, and for the source from which this work\nderives the real stamp of style one must go back to the austere genius\nof Inigo Jones The importance of the architect, in influencing\ncraftsmen in all such matters as this, cannot be overrated He has, or\nought to have, sufficient knowledge of the crafts to settle for the\ncraftsman the all-important points of scale and proportion to the rest\nof the design; and this is just one of those points in which\ncontemporary architecture, both as regards the education of the\narchitect and current practice, is exceedingly apt to fail Sir William\nChambers and the brothers Adam were the last of the architects\nbefore the cataclysm of the nineteenth century who made designs for\n\n\nfurniture with any degree of skill In the latter half of the eighteenth century occur the familiar names of\nChippendale, Heppelwhite, and Sheraton, and if these excellent\ncabinetmakers did a tenth of the work with which the dealers credit\nthem, they must each have had the hundred hands of Gyas The\nrosewood furniture inlaid with arabesques in thin flat brass, and made\nby Gillow at the end of the last century, is perhaps the last genuine\neffort in English furniture, though the tradition of good work and\nsimple design died very hard in old-fashioned country places The\nmischief began with the ridiculous mediævalism of Horace Walpole,\nwhich substituted amateur fancy for craftsmanship, and led in the\nfollowing century to the complete extinction of any tradition\nwhatever The heavy attempts at furniture in the Greek style which\naccompanied the architecture of Wilkins and Soane were as artificial\nas this literary Gothic, and the two resulted in the chaos of art which\nfound its expression in the great Exhibition of 1851 Three great qualities stamped the English tradition in furniture so\nlong as it was a living force—steadfastness of purpose, reserve in\ndesign, and thorough workmanship Take any good period of English\nfurniture, and one finds certain well-recognised types consistently\nadhered to throughout the country There is no difficulty in grasping\ntheir general characteristics, whereas the very genius of classification\ncould furnish no clue to the labyrinth of nineteenth-century design The men of these earlier times made no laborious search for\nquaintness, no disordered attempt to combine the peculiarities of a\ndozen different ages One general type was adhered to because it was\nthe legacy of generations, and there was no reason for departing from\nsuch an excellent model The designers and the workmen had only to\nperfect what was already good; they made no experiments in\nornament, but used it with nice judgment, and full knowledge of its\neffect The result was that, instead of being forced and unreasonable,\ntheir work was thoroughly happy; one cannot think of it as better\ndone than it is The quality of reserve and sobriety is even more important As\ncompared with the later developments of the Renaissance on the\nContinent, English furniture was always distinguished by its simplicity\nand self-restraint Yet it is this very quality which is most\nconspicuously absent from modern work As a people we rather pride\n\n\nourselves on the resolute suppression of any florid display of feeling,\nbut art in this country is so completely divorced from everyday\nexistence, that it never seems to occur to an Englishman to import\nsome of this fine insular quality into his daily surroundings It has been reserved for this generation to part company with the\ntradition of finished workmanship Good work of course can be done,\nbut it is exceedingly difficult to find the workman, and the average is\nbad We have nothing to take the place of the admirable\ncraftsmanship of the last century, which included not only great\nmanual skill, but also an assured knowledge of the purpose of any\ngiven piece of furniture, of the form best suited for it, and the exact\nstrength of material necessary, a knowledge which came of long\nfamiliarity with the difficulties of design and execution, which never\nhesitated in its technique, which attained a rightness of method so\ncomplete as to seem inevitable Craftsmanship of this order hardly\nexists nowadays It is the result of tradition, of the labour of many\ngenerations of cunning workmen Lastly, as the complement of these lapses on the part of the craftsman,\nthere has been a gradual decadence in the taste of the public Science\nand mechanical ingenuity have gone far to destroy the art of the\nhandicrafts Art is a matter of the imagination, and of the skill of one's\nhands—but the pace nowadays is too much for it Certainly from the\nsixteenth to the eighteenth century a well-educated English gentleman\nhad some knowledge of the arts, and especially of architecture; the\nEarl of Burlington even designed important buildings, though not with\nremarkable success; but at any rate educated people had some insight\ninto the arts, whether inherited or acquired Nowadays good\neducation and breeding are no guarantee for anything of the sort,\nunless it is some miscellaneous knowledge of pictures Few people,\noutside the artists, and not too many of them, give any serious\nattention to architecture and sculpture, and consequently an art such\nas furniture, which is based almost entirely upon these, is hardly\nrecognised by the public as an art at all How much the artist and his\npublic react upon each other is shown by the plain fact that up to the\nlast few years they have steadily marched down hill together, and it is\nnot very certain that they have yet begun to turn the corner That our\nEnglish tradition was once a living thing is shown by the beautiful\nfurniture, purely English in design and execution, still to be seen in\ngreat houses and museums, but it is not likely that such a tradition\n\n\nwill spring up again till the artists try to make the unity of the arts a\nreal thing, and the craftsman grows callous to fashion and\narchæology, and the public resolutely turns its back on what is tawdry\nand silly",

    "Lethaby OF DECORATED FURNITURE\nDecorated or \"sumptuous\" furniture is not merely furniture that is\nexpensive to buy, but that which has been elaborated with much\nthought, knowledge, and skill Such furniture cannot be cheap,\ncertainly, but the real cost of it is sometimes borne by the artist who\nproduces rather than by the man who may happen to buy it Furniture\non which valuable labour is bestowed may consist of—1 Large\nstanding objects which, though actually movable, are practically\nfixtures, such as cabinets, presses, sideboards of various kinds;\nmonumental objects Large\nstanding objects which, though actually movable, are practically\nfixtures, such as cabinets, presses, sideboards of various kinds;\nmonumental objects 2 Chairs, tables of convenient shapes, stands for\nlights and other purposes, coffers, caskets, mirror and picture frames 3 Numberless small convenient utensils Here we can but notice class\n1, the large standing objects which most absorb the energies of artists\nof every degree and order in their construction or decoration Cabinets seem to have been so named as being little strongholds\n—\"offices\" of men of business for stowing papers and documents in\norderly receptacles They are secured with the best locks procurable They often contain secret drawers and cavities, hidden from all eyes\nbut those of the owner Nor are instances wanting of owners leaving\nno information on these matters to their heirs, so that casual buyers\nsometimes come in for a windfall, or such a catastrophe as befell the\nowner of Richard the Third's bed It is not to be expected that elaborate systems of secret drawers and\nhiding-places should be contrived in cabinets of our time Money and\njewels are considered safer when deposited in banks But, ingenuity of\nconstruction in a complicated piece of furniture must certainly be\ncounted as one of its perfections Sound and accurate joinery with\nwell-seasoned woods, properly understood as to shrinkage and as to\nthe relations between one kind of timber and another in these\nrespects, is no small merit Some old English cabinets are to be met with in the construction of\nwhich wood only is used, the morticing admirable, the boards, used to\nhold ends and divisions together from end to end, strained and\nsecured by wedges that turn on pivots, etc Furniture of this kind can\nbe taken to pieces and set up, resuming proper rigidity toties quoties To look at the subject historically, it seems that the cabinet, dresser,\nor sideboard is a chest set on legs, and that the \"press,\" or cupboard\n(closet, not proper cup-board), takes the place of the panelled recess\nclosed by doors, generally contrived, and sometimes ingeniously\nhidden, in the construction of a panelled room The front of the\nelevated chest is hinged, and flaps down, while the lid is a fixture; the\ninterior is more complicated than that of the chest, as its subdivisions\nare more conveniently reached Before leaving this part of the subject, it is worth notice that the\narchitectural, or rather architectonic, character seems to have deeply\nimpressed the makers of cabinets when the chest-type had gradually\nbeen lost Italian, German, English, and other cabinets are often found\nrepresenting a church front or a house front, with columns, doors,\nsometimes ebony and ivory pavements, etc Next as to methods of decorating cabinets, etc The kind which\ndeserves our first attention is that of sculpture Here, undoubtedly, we\nmust look to the Italians as our masters, and to that admirable school\nof wood-carving which maintained itself so long in Flanders, with an\nItalian grace grafted on the ingenuity, vigour, and playfulness of a\nnorthern race Our English carvers, admirable craftsmen during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, seem to have been closely allied\nwith the contemporary Flemings Fronts of cabinets, dressers,\nchimneypieces, etc , were imported from Belgium and were made up\nby English joiners with panelling, supplemented with carving where\nrequired, for our great houses But the best Italian carving remains on\nchests and chest fronts which were made in great numbers in the\nsixteenth century Some of these chests are toilet chests; some have formed wall-seats,\nlaid along the sides of halls and galleries to hold hangings, etc , when\nthe house was empty, and have served as seats or as \"monumental\"\npieces when company was received As the chest grew into the cabinet, or bureau, or dresser, great\nattention was paid to the supports It need hardly be pointed out that,\nfor the support of seats, tables, etc , animals, typical of strength or\nother qualities—the lion or the sphinx, the horse, sometimes the slave\n—have been employed by long traditional usage And carvers of wood\nhave not failed to give full attention to the use and decoration of\n\n\nconventional supports to the furniture now under discussion They are\nmade to unite the central mass to a shallow base, leaving the\nremaining space open Next to sculptured decoration comes incrusted The most costly kinds\nof material, precious stones, such as lapis lazuli, agate, rare marbles,\netc , have been employed on furniture surfaces But such work is\nrather that of the lapidary than of the cabinetmaker It is very costly,\nand seems to have been confined, in fact, to the factories kept up in\nItaly, Russia, and other states, at government expense We do not\nproduce them in this country; and the number of such objects is\nprobably limited wherever we look for them Incrustation of precious woods is a more natural system of wood-\ndecoration Veneered wood, which is laid on a roughened surface with\nthin glue at immense pressure, if well made, is very long-lived The\nwoods used give a coloured surface, and are polished so as to bring\nthe colour fully out, and to protect the material from damp In fine\nexamples the veneers form little pictures, or patterns, either by the\narrangement of the grain of the pieces used, so as to make pictorial\nlines by means of the grain itself, or by using woods of various\ncolours A very fine surface decoration was invented, or carried to perfection,\nby André Charles Boule, for Louis XIV It is a veneer of tortoise-shell\nand brass, with occasional white metal An important element in\nBoule decoration is noticeable in the chiselled angle mounts, lines of\nmoulding, claws, feet, etc , all of which are imposed, though they\nhave the general character of metal angle supports In fact, the\ntortoise-shell is held by glue, and the metal by fine nails of the same\nmaterial, the heads of which are filed down Incrustation, or\nmarquetry, of this kind is costly, and most of it is due to the labours of\nartists and craftsmen employed by the kings of France at the expense\nof the Government A considerable quantity of it is still made in that\ncountry Now as to the way in which sculptors, or incrusters, should dispose of\ntheir decoration, and the fidelity to nature which is to be expected of\nthem, whether in sculpture or wood mosaic, i e wood painting First,\nwe may suppose they will concentrate their more important details in\nrecognisable divisions of their pieces, or in such ways that a\n\n\nproportion and rhythm shall be expressed by their dispositions of\nmasses and fine details; placing their figures in central panels, on\nangles, or on dividing members; leaving some plain surface to set off\ntheir decorative detail; and taking care that the contours of running\nmouldings shall not be lost sight of by the carver But how far is\nabsolute natural truth, even absolute obedience to the laws of his art\nin every particular of his details, to be expected from the artist We\ncannot doubt that such absolute obedience is sometimes departed\nfrom intentionally and with success All Greek sculpture is not always\nabsolutely true to nature nor as beautiful as the sculptor, if free, could\nhave made it Statues are conventionalised, decorative scrolls\nexaggerated, figures turned into columns for good reasons, and in the\nresult successfully In furniture, as in architecture, carved work or\nincrustation is not free, but is in service; and compromises with\nverisimilitude to nature, even violence, may sometimes be required on\ndetails in the interests of the entire structure Next let a word or two be reserved for Painted Furniture Painting has\nbeen employed on furniture of all kinds at many periods The ancients\nmade theirs of bronze, or of ivory, carved or inlaid In the Middle\nAges wood-carving and many kinds of furniture were painted The\ncoronation chair at Westminster was so decorated The chest fronts of\nDelli and other painters are often pictures of great intrinsic merit, and\nvery generally these family chest fronts are valuable records of\ncostumes and fashions of their day In this country the practice of\npainting pianoforte cases, chair-backs, table-tops, panels of all sorts,\nhas been much resorted to Distinguished painters, Angelica\nKauffmann and her contemporaries, and a whole race of coach-\npainters have left monuments of their skill in this line It must suffice\nhere to recall certain modern examples, e g a small dresser, now in\nthe national collections, with doors painted by Mr Poynter, with\nspirited figures representing the Beers and the Wines; the fine piano\ncase painted by Mr Burne-Jones; another by Mr Alma Tadema; lastly,\na tall clock-case by Mr Stanhope, which, as well as other promising\nexamples, have been exhibited by the Arts and Crafts Society",

and, assuming the designer to be fairly dexterous in the\nuse of clay or other plastic material, a sketch model will not occupy\nany more of his time than a drawing would To put it plainly, no designer can ever know what he ought to expect\nfrom a worker in any material if he has not worked in that material\nhimself If he has carved marble, for instance, he knows the extreme\ncare required in under-cutting the projecting parts of the design, and\nthe cost entailed by the processes necessary to be employed for that\npurpose He therefore so arranges the various parts of his design that\nwherever it is possible these projecting portions shall be supported by\nother forms, so avoiding the labour and cost of relieving (or under-\ncutting) them; and if he be skilful his skill will appear in the fact that\nhis motive in this will be apparent only to experts, while to others the\nwhole will appear to grow naturally out of the design Moreover, he\nknows that he must depend for the success of this thing on an effect of\nbreadth and dignity He is not afraid of a somewhat elaborate surface\ntreatment, being aware that nearly any variety of surface which he\ncan readily produce in clay may be rendered in marble with a\nreasonable amount of trouble In designing for the wood-carver he is on altogether different ground He may safely lay aside some portion of his late dignity, and depend\nalmost entirely on vigour of line; the ease with which under-cutting is\ndone in this material enabling him to obtain contrast by the use of\ndelicately relieved forms Here, however, he must not allow the effect\nin his model to depend in any degree on surface treatment Care in\nthat respect will prevent disappointment in the finished work The most noticeable feature in modern carved surface decoration is\nthe almost universal tendency to overcrowding It appears seldom to\nhave occurred to the craftsman or designer that decorating a panel,\nfor instance, is not at all the same thing as covering it with\ndecoration Still less does he seem to have felt that occasionally some\nportions of the ground are much more valuable in the design than\nanything which he can put on them Indeed, the thoughtful designer\nwho understands its use and appreciates its value, frequently has more\ntrouble with his ground than with anything else in the panel Also, if\n\n\nhe have the true decorative spirit, his mind is constantly on the\ngeneral scheme surrounding his work, and he is always ready to\nsubordinate himself and his work in order that it may enhance and\nnot disturb this general scheme We will suppose, for example, that he has to decorate a column with\nraised ornament He feels at once that the outlines of that column are\nof infinitely more importance than anything which he can put on it,\nhowever ingenious or beautiful his design may be He therefore keeps\nhis necessary projecting parts as small and low as possible, leaving as\nmuch of the column as he can showing between the lines of his\npattern By this means the idea of strength and support is not\ninterfered with, and the tout ensemble is not destroyed This may seem somewhat elementary to many who will read it My\nexcuse must be that one sees many columns in which every vestige of\nthe outline is so covered by the carving which has been built round\nthem, that the idea of their supporting anything other than their\nornament appears preposterous There has been no opportunity to do more than glance at such a\nsubject as this in a space so limited; but the purposes of this paper will\nhave been served if it has supplied a useful hint to any craftsman, or if\nby its means any designer shall have been induced to make a more\nthorough study of the materials within his reach Stephen Webb INTARSIA AND INLAID WOOD-WORK\nAlthough decoration by inlaying woods of different colours must\nnaturally have suggested itself in very early times, as soon indeed as\nthere were workmen of skill sufficient for it, the history of this branch\nof art practically begins in the fifteenth century It is eminently an\nItalian art, which according to Vasari had its origin in the days of\nBrunelleschi and Paolo Uccello; and it had its birth in a land which\nhas a greater variety of mild close-grained woods with a greater\nvariety of colour than Northern Europe By the Italians it was\nregarded as a lower form of painting Like all mosaic, of which art it is\nproperly a branch, it has its limitations; and it is only so long as it\nconfines itself to these that it is a legitimate form of decoration Tarsia\nis at the best one of the minor decorative arts, but when well\nemployed it is one that gives an immense deal of pleasure, and one to\nwhich it cannot be denied that the buildings of Italy owe much of\ntheir splendour Their polished and inlaid furniture harmonises with\nthe rare delicacy of their marble and mosaic, and goes far towards\nproducing that air of rich refinement and elaborate culture which is to\nthe severer styles and simpler materials of the North what the velvet-\nrobed Senator of St Mark was to the mail-clad feudal chief from\nbeyond the Alps As to its durability, the experience of four centuries\nsince Vasari's time has proved that with ordinary care, or perhaps\nwith nothing worse than mere neglect, Intarsia will last as long as\npainting Its only real enemy is damp, as will be readily understood\nfrom the nature of the materials and the mode of putting them\ntogether For though in a few instances, when the art was in its\ninfancy, the inlaid pattern may have been cut of a substantial\nthickness and sunk into a solid ground ploughed out to receive it, this\nmethod was obviously very laborious, and admitted only of very\nsimple design, for it is very difficult in this way to keep the lines of\nthe drawing accurately The recognised way of making Intarsia was,\nand is, to form both pattern and ground in thin veneers about 1/16 of\nan inch thick, which are glued down upon a solid panel At first sight\nthis method may appear too slight and unsubstantial for work\nintended to last for centuries, but it has, in fact, stood the test of time\nextremely well, when the work has been kept in the dry even\ntemperature of churches and great houses, where there is neither\n\n\ndamp to melt the glue and swell the veneer, nor excessive heat to\nmake the wood shrink and start asunder When these conditions were\nnot observed, of course the work was soon ruined, and Vasari tells an\namusing story of the humiliation which befell Benedetto da Majano,\nwho began his career as an Intarsiatore, in the matter of two splendid\nchests which he had made for Matthias Corvinus, from which the\nveneers, loosened by the damp of a sea voyage, fell off in the royal\npresence The veneers being so thin, it is of course easy to cut through several\nlayers of them at once, and this suggested, or at all events lent itself\nadmirably to the design of the earlier examples, which are generally\narabesques symmetrically disposed right and left of a central line If\ntwo dark and two light veneers are put together, the whole of one\npanel, both ground and pattern, can be cut at one operation with a\nthin fret saw; the ornamental pattern drops into the space cut out of\nthe ground, which it, of course, fits exactly except for the thickness of\nthe saw-cut, and the two half-patterns thus filled in are \"handed\" right\nand left, and so complete the symmetrical design The line given by\nthe thickness of the saw is then filled in with glue and black colour so\nas to define the outline, and additional saw-cuts are made or lines are\nengraved, and in either case filled in with the same stopping,\nwherever additional lines are wanted for the design It only remains to\nglue the whole down to a solid panel, and to polish and varnish the\nsurface, and it is then ready to be framed into its place as the back of\na church stall, or the lining of a courtly hall, library, or cabinet It was thus that the simpler Italian Intarsia was done, such as that in\nthe dado surrounding Perugino's Sala del Cambio in his native city,\nwhere the design consists of light arabesques in box or some similar\nwood on a walnut ground, defined by black lines just as I have\ndescribed But like all true artists the Intarsiatore did not stand still Having\nsuccessfully accomplished simple outline and accurate drawing, he\nwas dissatisfied until he could carry his art farther by introducing the\nrefinement of shading This was done at different times and by\ndifferent artists in a variety of ways; either by inlaying the shadow in\ndifferent kinds of woods, by scorching it with fire, or by staining it\nwith chemical solutions In the book desks of the choir at the Certosa\nor Charterhouse of Pavia, the effect of shading is got in a direct but\n\n\nsomewhat imperfect way by laying strips of different coloured woods\nside by side Each flower or leaf was probably built up of tolerably\nthick pieces of wood glued together in position, so that they could be\nsliced off in veneers and yield several flowers or leaves from the same\nblock, much in the way of Tunbridge Wells ware, though the Italian\nspecimens are, I believe, always cut with the grain and not across it The designs thus produced are very effective at a short distance, but\nthe method is, of course, suitable only to bold and simple\nconventional patterns The panels of the high screen or back to the stalls at the same church\nafford an instance of a more elaborate method These splendid panels,\nwhich go all round the choir, contain each a three-quarter-length\nfigure of a saint Lanzi deservedly praises them as the largest and most\nperfect figures of tarsia which he had seen They date from 1486, and\nwere executed by an Istrian artist, Bartolommeo da Pola, perhaps\nfrom the designs of Borgognone The method by which their highly\npictorial effect is produced is a mixed one, the shading being partly\ninlaid with woods of different colours, and partly obtained by\nscorching the wood with fire or hot sand in the manner generally in\nuse for marqueterie at the present day The inexhaustible patience as\nwell as the fertility of resource displayed by Messer Bartolommeo is\nastonishing Where the saw-cut did not give him a strong enough line\nhe has inlaid a firm line of black wood, the high lights of the draperies\nare inlaid in white, the folds shaded by burning, and the flowing lines\nof the curling hair are all inlaid, each several tress being shaded by\nthree narrow strips of gradated colour following the curved lines of\nthe lock to which they belong When it is remembered that there are\nsome forty or more of these panels, each differing from the rest, the\nsplendour as well as the laborious nature of the decoration of this\nunrivalled choir will be better understood Of all the examples of pictorial Intarsia the most elaborate are perhaps\nthose in the choir stalls of Sta Maria Maggiore in Bergamo They are\nattributed to Gianfrancesco Capo di Ferro, who worked from the\ndesigns of Lotto, and was either a rival or pupil of Fra Damiano di\nBergamo, a famous master of the art They consist of figure subjects\nand landscapes on a small scale, shaded with all the delicacy and\nroundness attainable in a tinted drawing, and certainly show how\nnear Intarsia can approach to painting Their drawing is excellent and\ntheir execution marvellous; but at the same time one feels that,\n\n\nhowever one may admire them as a tour de force, the limitations of\ngood sense and proper use of the material have been reached and\noverstepped When the delicacy of the work is so great that it requires\nto be covered up or kept under glass, it obviously quits the province\nof decorative art; furniture is meant to be used, and when it is too\nprecious to be usable on account of the over-delicate ornament\nbestowed upon it, it must be admitted that the ornament is out of\nplace, and, therefore, bad art The later Italian Intarsia was betrayed into extravagance by the\ndexterity of the craftsman The temptation before which he fell was\nthat of rivalling the painter, and as he advanced in facility of\ntechnique, and found wider resources at his command, he threw aside\nnot only those restraints which necessity had hitherto imposed, but\nalso those which good taste and judgment still called him to obey In\nthe plain unshaded arabesques of the Sala del Cambio, and even in\nthe figure panels of the Certosa, the treatment is purely decorative;\nthe idea of a plane surface is rightly observed, and there is no attempt\nto represent distance or to produce illusory effects of relief Above all,\nthe work is solid and simple enough to bear handling; the stalls may\nbe sat in, the desks may be used for books, the doors may be opened\nand shut, without fear of injury to their decoration Working within\nthese limits, the art was safe; but they came in time to be disregarded,\nand in this, as in other branches of art, the style was ruined by the\nover-ingenuity of the artists Conscious of their own dexterity, they\nattempted things never done before, with means quite unsuited to the\npurpose, and with the sole result that they did imperfectly and\nlaboriously with their wooden veneers, their glue-pot, and their\nchemicals, what the painter did with crayon and brush perfectly and\neasily Their greatest triumphs after they began to run riot in this way,\nhowever interesting as miracles of dexterity, have no value as works\nof art in the eyes of those who know the true principles of decorative\ndesign; while nothing can be much duller than the elaborate\nplayfulness of the Intarsiatore who loved to cover his panelling with\nsham book-cases, birds in cages, guitars, and military instruments in\nelaborate perspective It would take too long to say much about the art in its application to\nfurniture, such as tables, chairs, cabinets, and other movables, which\nare decorated with inlay that generally goes by the French name of\nmarqueterie Marqueterie and Intarsia are the same thing, though\n\n\nfrom habit the French title is generally used when speaking of work\non a smaller scale And as the methods and materials are the same,\nwhether used on a grand or a small scale, so the same rules and\nrestraints apply to both classes of design, and can no more be\ninfringed with impunity on the door of a tall clock-case than on the\ndoors of a palatial hall of audience Nothing can be a prettier or more\npractical and durable mode of decorating furniture than marqueterie\nin simple brown, black, yellow, and white; and when used with\njudgment there is nothing to forbid the employment of dyed woods;\nwhile the smallness of the scale puts at our disposal ivory, mother-of-\npearl, and tortoise-shell, materials which in larger works are naturally\nout of the question Nothing, on the other hand, is more offensive to\ngood taste than some of the overdone marqueterie of the French\nschool of the last century, with its picture panels, and naturalesque\nfigures, flowers, and foliage, straggling all over the surface, as if the\narticle of furniture were merely a vehicle for the cleverness of the\nmarqueterie cutter Still worse is the modern work of the kind,\nwhether English or foreign, of which so much that is hopelessly\npretentious and vulgar is turned out nowadays, in which the aim of\nthe designer seems to have been to cover the surface as thickly as he\ncould with flowers and festoons of all conceivable colours, without\nany regard for the form of the thing he was decorating, the nature of\nthe material he was using, or the graceful disposition and economy of\nthe ornament he was contriving T G Jackson",
    "Jackson WOODS AND OTHER MATERIALS\nThe woods in ordinary use by cabinetmakers may be divided broadly\ninto two classes, viz those which by their strength, toughness, and\nother qualities are suitable for construction, and those which by\nreason of the beauty of their texture or grain, their rarity, or their\ncostliness, have come to be used chiefly for decorative purposes—\nveneering or inlaying There are certainly several woods which\ncombine the qualities necessary for either purpose, as will be noticed\nlater on At present the above classification is sufficiently accurate for\nthe purposes of this paper The woods chiefly used in the construction\nof cabinet work and furniture are oak, walnut, mahogany, rosewood,\nsatin-wood, cedar, plane, sycamore The oak has been made the standard by which to measure all other\nwoods for the qualities of strength, toughness, and durability There\nare said to be nearly fifty species of oak known, but the common\nEnglish oak possesses these qualities in a far greater degree than any\nother wood It is, however, very cross-grained and difficult to manage\nwhere delicate details are required, and its qualities recommend it to\nthe carpenter rather than to the furniture-maker, who prefers the\nsofter and straight-grained oak from Turkey or wainscot from\nHolland, which, in addition to being more easily worked and taking a\nhigher finish, is not so liable to warp or split There is also a species called white oak, which is imported into this\ncountry from America, and is largely used for interior fittings and\ncabinet-making It is not equal to the British oak in strength or\ndurability, and it is inferior to the wainscot in the beauty of its\nmarkings The better the quality of this oak, the more it shrinks in\ndrying Walnut is a favourite wood with the furniture-maker, as well as the\ncarver, on account of its even texture and straight grain The English\nvariety is of a light grayish-brown colour, which colour improves\nmuch by age under polish That from Italy has more gray in it, and\nthough it looks extremely well when carved is less liked by carvers on\naccount of its brittleness It is but little liable to the attacks of worms In the English kind, the older (and therefore, generally speaking, the\n\n\nbetter) wood may be recognised by its darker colour Of mahogany there are two kinds, viz those which are grown in the\nislands of Cuba and Jamaica, and in Honduras The Cuba or Spanish\nmahogany is much the harder and more durable, and is, in the\nopinion of the writer, the very best wood for all the purposes of the\ncabinet or furniture maker known to us It is beautifully figured, takes\na fine polish, is not difficult to work, when its extreme hardness is\ntaken into account, and is less subject to twisting and warping than\nany other kind of wood It has become so costly of late years,\nhowever, that it is mostly cut into veneers, and used for the\ndecoration of furniture surfaces Honduras mahogany, or, as cabinetmakers call it, \"Bay Wood,\" is that\nwhich is now in most frequent demand for the construction of the best\nkinds of furniture and cabinet work It is fairly strong (though it\ncannot compare in that respect with Cuba or rosewood), works easily,\ndoes not shrink, resists changes of temperature without alteration, and\nholds glue well, all of which qualities specially recommend it for the\npurposes of construction where veneers are to be used Many\ncabinetmakers prefer to use this wood for drawers, even in an oak job Rosewood is one of those woods used indifferently for construction or\nfor the decoration of other woods Though beautiful specimens of\ngrain and figure are often seen, its colour does not compare with good\nspecimens of Cuba veneer Its purple tone (whatever stains are used)\nis not so agreeable as the rich, deep, mellow browns of the mahogany;\nnor does it harmonise so readily with its surroundings in an ordinary\nroom It has great strength and durability, and is not difficult to work Probably the best way to use it constructively is in the making of\nsmall cabinets, chairs, etc —that is, if one wishes for an appearance of\nlightness with real strength The writer does not here offer any\nopinion as to whether a piece of furniture, or indeed anything else,\nshould or should not look strong when it really is so Satin-wood, most of which comes from the West India islands, is well\nknown for its fine lustre and grain, as also for its warm colour, which\nis usually deepened by yellow stain It is much used for painted\nfurniture, and the plain variety is liked by the carver Cedar is too well known to need any description here It is commonly\nbelieved that no worm will touch it, and it is therefore greatly in\n\n\ndemand for the interior fitting of cabinets, drawers, etc It is a\nstraight-grained wood and fairly easy to work, though liable to split It\nis impossible in a short paper like the present to do more than glance\nat a few of the numerous other woods in common use Ebony has\nalways been greatly liked for small or elaborate caskets or cabinets, its\nextreme closeness of grain and hardness enabling the carver to bring\nup the smallest details with all the sharpness of metal work Sycamore, beech, and holly are frequently stained to imitate walnut,\nrosewood, or other materials; of these the first two are used\nconstructively, but the latter, which takes the stain best, is nearly all\ncut into veneer, and, in addition to its use for covering large surfaces,\nforms an important element in the modern marquetry decorations Bass wood, on account of its softness and the facility with which it\ncan be stained to any requisite shade, is extensively used to imitate\nother woods in modern furniture of the cheaper sort It should,\nhowever, never be used for furniture at all, as it has (as a\ncabinetmaker would say) no \"nature\" in it, and in the result there is no\nwear in it Other woods, coming under the second category, as amboyna,\ncoromandel, snake-wood, orange-wood, thuyer, are all woods of a\nbeautiful figure, which may be varied indefinitely by cutting the\nveneers at different angles to the grain of the wood, and the tone may\nalso be varied by the introduction of colour into the polish which is\nused on them Coromandel wood is one of the most beautiful of these,\nbut it is not so available as it would otherwise be on account of its\nresistance to glue Orange-wood, when not stained, is very wasteful in\nuse, as the natural colour is confined to the heart of the tree Silver, white metal, brass, etc , are cut into a veneer of tortoise-shell\nor mother-of-pearl, producing a decorative effect which, in the\nopinion of the writer, is more accurately described as \"gorgeous\" than\n\"beautiful \"\nThere are many processes and materials used to alter or modify the\ncolour of woods and to \"convert\" one wood into another Oak is

    "Ordinary oak is made into brown\noak by being treated with a solution of chromate of potash (which is\nalso used to convert various light woods into mahogany, etc ) ) Pearlash is used for the same purpose, though not commonly For\nconverting pear-tree, sycamore, etc , into ebony, two or more\napplications of logwood chips, with an after application of vinegar\nand steel filings, are used A good deal of bedroom and other furniture is enamelled, and here\nthe ground is prepared with size and whiting, and this is worked over\nwith flake white, transparent polish, and bismuth But by far the most\nbeautiful surface treatment in this kind are the lacquers, composed of\nspirit and various gums, or of shellac and spirit into which colour is\nintroduced But by far the most\nbeautiful surface treatment in this kind are the lacquers, composed of\nspirit and various gums, or of shellac and spirit into which colour is\nintroduced Stephen Webb Stephen Webb OF MODERN EMBROIDERY\nIf we wish to arrive at a true estimate of the value of modern\nembroidery, we must examine the work being sold in the fancy-work\nshops, illustrated in ladies' newspapers or embroidered in the\ndrawing-rooms of to-day, and consider in what respect it differs from\nthe old work such as that exhibited in the South Kensington Museum The old embroidery and the modern differ widely—in design, in\ncolour, and in material; nor would any one deny that a very large\nproportion of modern work is greatly inferior to that of past times What, then, are the special characteristics of the design of the present\nday Modern design is frequently very naturalistic, and seems rather to\nseek after a life-like rendering of the object to be embroidered than\nthe decoration of the material to be ornamented Then again it may be noted that modern designs are often ill adapted\nto the requirements of embroidery This is probably because many of\nthe people who design for embroidery do not understand it Very\noften a design that has been made for this purpose would have been\nbetter suited to a wall paper, a panel of tiles, or a woven pattern The\ndesigner should either be also an embroiderer or have studied the\nsubject so thoroughly as to be able to direct the worker, for the design\nshould be drawn in relation to the colours and stitches in which it is\nto be carried out The more, indeed, people will study the fine designs of the past, and\ncompare with them the designs of the art-needlework of the present,\nthe more they will realise that, where the former is rich, dignified,\nand restrained, obedient to law in every curve and line, the latter is\nflorid, careless, weak, and ignores law And how finished that old\nembroidery was, and how full No grudging of the time or the labour\nspent either on design or needlework; no scamping; no mere\noutlining Border within border we often see, and all the space within\ncovered up to the edges and into the corners Contrast with this very\nmuch of our modern work Let us take as an example one piece that\nwas on view this summer at a well-known place in London where\n\n\nembroidery is sold It is merely a type of many others in many other\nplaces",
    "It is merely a type of many others in many other\nplaces This was a threefold screen made of dark red-brown velveteen All over it ran diagonal crossing lines coarsely worked in light silk, to\nimitate a wire trellis, with occasional upright supports worked in\nbrown wool, imitating knotty sticks Up one side of this trellis climbed\na scrambling mass of white clematis; one spray wandering along the\ntop fell a little way down the other side Thus a good part of the\nscreen was bare of embroidery, except for the trellis Naturalism could\nnot go much farther, design is almost absent, and the result is feeble\nand devoid of beauty If we turn now to material, we shall find that embroidery, like some\nother arts, depends much for its excellence on the minor crafts which\nprovide it with material; and these crafts supplied it with better\nmaterial in former times than they do now A stuff to be used as a\nground for embroidery should have endless capacities for wear This\nwas a quality eminently possessed by hand-spun and hand-woven\nlinen, which, with its rounded and separate thread, and the creamy\ntint of its partial bleaching, made an ideal ground for embroidery Or\nif silk were preferred, the silks of past centuries were at once thick,\nfirm, soft and pure, quite free from the dress or artificial thickening,\nby whose aid a silk nowadays tries to look rich when it is not The\noatmeal cloth, diagonal cloth, cotton-backed satin, velveteen and\nplush, so much used now, are very inferior materials as grounds for\nneedlework to the hand-loom linens and silks on which so large a part\nof the old embroidery remaining to us was worked And so very much\nof the beauty of the embroidery depends on the appropriateness of the\nmaterial [1] Cloth, serge, and plush are not appropriate; embroidery\nnever looks half so well on them as on silk and linen It is equally important that the thread, whether of silk, wool, flax, or\nmetal, should be pure and as well made as it can be, and, if dyed,\ndyed with colours that will stand light and washing Most of the silk,\nwool, and flax thread sold for embroidery is not as good as it should\nbe The filoselles and crewels very soon get worn away from the\nsurface of the material they are worked on The crewels are made of\ntoo soft a wool, and are not twisted tight enough, and the filoselles,\nnot being made of pure silk, should never be used at all, pretty and\nsoft though their effect undoubtedly is while fresh Though every\nimaginable shade of colour can be produced by modern dyers, the\ncraft seems to have been better understood by the dyers of times not\n\n\nvery long past, who, though they may not have been able to produce\nso many shades, could dye colours which would wash and did not\nquickly fade, or when they faded merely lost some colour, instead of\nchanging colour, as so many modern dyes do The old embroidery is\nworked with purer and fewer colours; now all kinds of dull\nintermediate tints are used of gold, brown, olive, and the like, which\ngenerally fade rapidly and will not wash Many people, admiring old\nembroidery and desiring to make their new work look like it at least\nin colour, will use tints as faint and delicate as the faded old colours,\nforgetting that in a few years their work will be almost colourless It is\nwiser to use strong good colours, for a little fading does not spoil but\nreally improves them So we see that many things combine to render embroidery as fine as\nthat of the past difficult of production, and there is nothing more\nagainst it than machinery, which floods the market with its cheap\nimitations, so that an embroidered dress is no longer the choice and\nrare production it once was; the machine-made imitation is so\ncommon and so cheap that a refined taste, sick of the vulgarity of the\nimitation, cares little even for the reality, and seeks refuge in an\nunornamented plainness The hand-worked embroidery glorified and\ngave value to the material it was worked on The machine-work\ncannot lift it above the commonplace When will people understand\nthat the more ornament is slow and difficult of production, the more\nwe appreciate it when we have got it; that it is because we know that\nthe thought of a human brain and the skill of a human hand went into\nevery stroke of a chisel, every touch of a brush, or every stitch placed\nby the needle, that we admire, enjoy, and wonder at the statue, the\npicture, or the needlework that is the result of that patience and that\nskill; and that we do not care about the ornament at all, and that it\nbecomes lifeless always, and often vulgar, when it has been made at\nlittle or no cost by a machine which is ready at any moment to\nproduce any quantity more of the same thing All ornament and\npattern was once produced by hand only, therefore it was always rare\nand costly and was valued accordingly Fashions did not change\nquickly It was worth while to embroider a garment beautifully, for it\nwould be worn for years, for a lifetime perhaps; and the elaborately\nworked counterpane would cover the bed in the guest-chamber for\nmore than one generation These remarks must be understood to apply to the ordinary fancy-\n\n\nwork and so-called \"art-needlework\" of the present day Twenty years\nago there would have been no ray of light in the depths to which the\nart of embroidery had fallen Now for some years steady and\nsuccessful efforts have been made by a few people to produce once\nmore works worthy of the past glories of the art They have proved to\nus that designers can design and that women can execute fine\nembroidery, but their productions are but as a drop in the ocean of\ninferior and valueless work Mary E Turner FOOTNOTES:\n[1] But cf \"Of Materials,\" p 365",
    "365 OF MATERIALS\nAlmost every fabric that is good of its kind is suitable for a ground for\nneedlework, and any thread of silk, linen, cotton, or wool, is suitable\nfor laying on a web, with the purpose of decorating it Yet these\nmaterials should not be wedded indiscriminately, every surface\nrequiring its peculiar treatment; a loose woollen fabric, for example,\nbeing best covered with wool-work rather than with silk Not that it is\nnecessary to work in linen thread on linen ground, in silk on silk\nground, and so forth; silk upon linen, silk on canvas, wool on linen,\nare legitimate, because suitable combinations; it being scarcely\nnecessary to note that linen or wool threads should not be used on silk\nsurface, as to place the poorer on the richer material would be an\nerror in taste Gold thread and precious stones will of course be\nreserved for the richer grounds, and the more elaborate kinds of work A plain or a figured (damask) silk can be employed as a ground for\nneedlework, the broken surface of a good damask sometimes\nenriching and helping out the design If work is to be laid directly on\nsilk ground, it should be rather open and light in character; if closer\nstitches are wanted, the principal forms are usually done on a canvas\nor linen backing, which is then cut out and \"applied\" to the final silk\nground, the design being carried on and completed by lighter work of\nlines and curves, and by the enrichment of gold thread, and\nsometimes even precious stones These two methods are a serious and\ndignified form of embroidery, and were often used by the great\nmediæval embroiderers on a rich figured or damask silk, and\nsometimes on plain silk, and sometimes on a silky velvet It is not easy\nto procure absolutely pure \"undressed\" silk now, and pliable silk\nvelvet of a suitable nature is still more difficult to obtain Satin is, to\nmy thinking, almost too shiny a surface for a ground, but it may,\noccasionally, be useful for small work A sort of imitation called\n\"Roman satin\" is sometimes employed on account of its cheapness and\neffectiveness, I suppose, as it cannot be for its beauty; the texture,\nwhen much handled, being woolly and unpleasant No one taking\ntrouble to procure choice materials will think of making use of it Floss silk lends itself particularly to the kind of needlework we are\nspeaking of; there is no twist on it, the silk is pure and untouched, if\n\n\nproperly dyed has a soft gloss, and a yielding surface that renders it\nquite the foremost of embroidery silks, though its delicate texture\nrequires skilful handling But avoid silks that profess to be floss with\nthe difficulty in handling removed If the old workers could use a pure\nuntwisted floss, surely we can take the trouble to conquer this\ndifficulty and do the same Twisted silk, if used on a silk ground,\nshould, I think, be rather fine; if thick and much twisted, it stands out\nin relief against the ground and gives a hard and ropy appearance I\nam, in fact, assuming that work on so costly a material as pure thick\nsilk is to be rather fine than coarse Gold and silver thread is much\nused with silk, but it is almost impossible to keep the silver from\ntarnishing Ordinary \"gold passing,\" which consists of a gilt silver\nthread wound round silk, is also apt to tarnish, and should always be\nlacquered before using—a rather troublesome process to do at home,\nas the gold has to be unwound and brushed over with the lacquer, and\nshould be dried in a warm room free from damp, or on a hot sunny\nday Japanese paper-gold is useful, for the reason that it does not\ntarnish, though in some ways it is more troublesome to manage than\nthe gold that can be threaded in a needle and passed through the\nmaterial It consists, like much of the ancient gold thread, of a gilded\nstrip of paper wound round silk, the old gold being gilded vellum,\nwhen not the flat gold beaten out thin (as, by the bye, in many of the\nEastern towels made to-day where the flat tinsel is very cleverly\nused) For needlework for more ordinary uses, linen is by far the most\npleasing and enduring web Unlike silk on the one side, and wool on\nthe other, it has scarcely any limitations in treatment, or in material\nsuitable to be used on it For hangings it can be chosen of a loose\nlarge texture, and covered with bold work executed in silk, linen\nthread, or wool, or it can be chosen of the finest thread, and covered\nwith minute delicate stitches; it can be worked equally well in the\nhand, or in a frame, and usually the more it is handled the better it\nlooks A thick twisted silk is excellent for big and coarse work on\nlinen, the stitches used being on the same scale, big and bold, and\nfiner silk used sparingly if needed White linen thread is often the\nmaterial employed for linen altar cloths, coverlets, etc , and some\nextremely choice examples of such work are to be seen in our\nmuseums, some worked roughly with a large linen thread and big\nstitches, some with patient minuteness It is hardly necessary to say\n\n\nhow important the design of such work is Different qualities of this material will be suggested to the\nembroideress by her needs; but, before passing to other things, I\nshould not omit mention of the charming linen woven at Langdale For some purposes it is very useful, as good linen for embroidering on\nis not easy to obtain We have, however, yet to find a web which will\nresemble the rougher and coarser linens used for old embroideries,\nrather loosely woven, with a thick glossy thread, and of a heavy yet\nyielding substance, quite unlike the hard paper-like surfaces of\nmachine-made linens The Langdale linen is, of course, hand-spun and\nhand-made, and the flat silky thread gives a very pleasant surface;\nbut, owing to its price and fine texture, it is not always suitable for\nthe purposes of large hangings Many fine examples of Persian work,\nsuch as quilts and so forth, are executed on a white cotton ground,\nneither very fine nor very coarse, entirely in floss silk, a variety of\nstitches being used, and the brightest possible colours chosen The\ncool silky surface of linen, however, commends itself more to us than\ncotton, each country rightly choosing the materials nearest to hand, in\nthis as in other decorative arts Both linen and cotton are good\ngrounds for wool-work, of which the most satisfactory kind is that\ndone on a large scale, with a variety of close and curious stitches\nwithin bold curves and outlines Canvas and net are open textures of linen or cotton, and can be used\neither as a ground-work covered entirely with some stitch like the old-\nfashioned cross-stitch or tent-stitch, or some kindred mechanical\nstitch, or it can stand as the ground, to be decorated with bright silks The texture of canvas being coarse, the design for it should be chosen\non a large scale, and thick silk used; floss preferably as the glossiest,\nbut a thick twisted silk is almost equally effective, and rather easier to\nhandle This canvas is used frequently in seventeenth-century Italian\nroom-hangings, either in the natural brownish colour, or dyed blue or\ngreen, the dye on it giving a dusky neutral colour which well shows\nup the richness of the silk Of woollen materials, cloth is the king; though as a ground for needle-\ndecoration it has its limitations It forms a good basis for appliqué, the\ngroups of ornament being worked separately, and laid on the cloth\nwith threads and cords of silk, gold, or wool, according to the\ntreatment decided on Rough serge gives a good surface for large open\n\n\nwool-work Such work is quickly done, and could be made a very\npleasing decoration for walls See the delightful inventories of the\nworldly goods of Sir John Fastolf in the notes to the Paston Letters,\nwhere the description of green and blue worsted hangings, and\n\"bankers\" worked over with roses and boughs, and hunting scenes,\nmake one long to emulate the rich fancies of forgotten arts, and try to\nplan out similar work, much of which was quite unambitious and\nsimple, both in design and execution \"Slack,\" a slightly twisted wool,\nworsted and crewel are usually the forms of work used; of these slack\nwool is the pleasantest for large work, worsted being too harsh;\ncrewel is very fine and much twisted,[1] often met with in old work of\na fine kind The advantage of wool over silk in cost is obvious, and\nrenders it suitable for the commoner uses of life, where lavishness\nwould be out of place May Morris FOOTNOTES:\n[1] Crewel, crull, curly:—\n\"His locks were crull as they were laid in press,\"\nsays Chaucer of the Squire in The Canterbury Tales",
    "FOOTNOTES:\n[1] Crewel, crull, curly:—\n\"His locks were crull as they were laid in press,\"\nsays Chaucer of the Squire in The Canterbury Tales COLOUR\nIt is not unusual to hear said of textiles and embroideries, \"I like soft\nquiet colouring; such and such is too bright \" This assertion is both\nright and wrong; it shows an instinctive pleasure in harmony\ncombined with ignorance of technique To begin with, colour cannot\nbe too bright in itself; if it appears so, it is the skill of the craftsman\nthat is at fault It will be noted in a fine piece of work that far from\nblazing with colour in a way to disturb the eye, its general effect is\nthat of a subdued glow; and yet, on considering the different shades of\nthe colours used, they are found to be in themselves of the brightest\nthe dyer can produce Thus I have seen in an old Persian rug light and\ndark blue flowers and orange leaves outlined with turquoise blue on a\nstrong red ground, a combination that sounds daring, and yet nothing\ncould be more peaceful in tone than the beautiful and complicated\ngroups of colours here displayed Harmony, then, produces this\nrepose, which is demanded instinctively, purity and crispness being\nfurther obtained by the quality of the colours used Thus in blues, use the shades that are only obtained satisfactorily by\nindigo dye, with such modifications as slightly \"greening\" with yellow\nwhen a green-blue is wanted, and so forth The pure blue of indigo,[1]\nneither slaty nor too hot and red on the one hand, nor tending to a\ncoarse \"peacock\" green-blue on the other, is perfect in all its tones,\nand of all colours the safest to use in masses Its modifications to\npurple on one side and green-blue on the other are also useful, though\nto be employed with moderation There are endless varieties of useful\nreds, from pink, salmon, orange, and scarlet, to blood-red and deep\npurple-red, obtained by different dyes and by different processes of\ndyeing Kermes, an insect dye, gives a very beautiful and permanent\ncolour, rather scarlet Cochineal, also an insect dye, gives a red, rather\ninferior, but useful for mixed shades, and much used on silk, of which\nmadder and kermes are apt to destroy the gloss, the former a good\ndeal, the latter slightly Madder, a vegetable dye, \"yields on wool a\ndeep-toned blood-red, somewhat bricky and tending to scarlet On\ncotton and linen all imaginable shades of red, according to the\nprocess \"[2] Of the shades into which red enters, avoid over-abundant\nuse of warm orange or scarlet, which are the more valuable\n(especially the latter) the more sparingly used; there is a dusky orange\n\n\nand a faint clear bricky scarlet, sometimes met with in old work, that\ndo not need this reservation, being quiet colours of impure yet\nbeautiful tone Clear, full yellow, fine in itself, also loses its value if\ntoo plentifully used, or lacking due relief by other colours The pure\ncolour is neither reddish and hot in tone, nor greenish and sickly It is\nvery abundant, for example, in Persian silk embroidery, also in\nChinese, and again in Spanish and Italian work of the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries The best and most permanent yellow dye,\nespecially valuable on silk, is weld or \"wild mignonette \"\nNext to blue, green seems the most natural colour to live with, and\nthe most restful to the eye and brain; yet it is curious to those not\nfamiliar with the ins and outs of dyeing that it should be so difficult to\nobtain through ordinary commercial channels a full, rich, permanent\ngreen, neither muddy yellow nor coarse bluish A dyer who employed\nold-fashioned dye-stuffs and methods would, however, tell us that the\ngreens of commerce are obtained by messes, and not by dyes, the only\nmethod for obtaining good shades being that of dyeing a blue of the\ndepth required in the indigo-vat, and afterwards \"greening\" it with\nyellow, with whatever modifications are needed Three sets of greens\nwill be found useful for needlework, full yellow-greens of two or three\nshades, grayish-greens, and blue-greens Of these, the shades tending\nto grayish-green are the most manageable in large masses There is\nalso an olive-green that is good, if not too dark and brown, when it\nbecomes a nondescript, and as such to be condemned Walnut (the roots or the husks or the nut) and catechu (the juice of a\nplant) are the most reliable brown dye-stuffs, giving good rich colour The best black, by the bye, formerly used, consisted of the darkest\nindigo shade the material would take, dipped afterwards in the walnut\nroot dye This hasty enumeration of dye-stuffs gives an idea of those principally\nused until this century, but now very rarely, since the reign of Aniline Yet they give the only really pure and permanent colours known, not\nlosing their value by artificial light, and very little and gradually\nfading through centuries of exposure to sunlight It would be pleasant\nif in purchasing silk or cloth one had not to pause and consider \"will it\nfade \" meaning not \"will it fade in a hundred, or ten, or three years \"\nbut \"will it fade and be an unsightly rag this time next month \" I\ncannot see that Aniline has done more for us than this Colour can be treated in several different ways: by distinctly light\nshades, whether few or many, on a dark ground, which treatment\nlends itself to great variety and effect; or by dark on a light ground,\nnot so rich or satisfying in effect; or again, by colour placed on colour\nof equal tone, as it were a mosaic or piecing together of colours\nunited, or \"jointed,\" by outlining round the various members of the\ndesign Black on white, or white on white, a mere drawing of a design\non the material, scarcely comes under the head of Colour, though, as\naforesaid, some very beautiful work has been done in this way As regards method of colouring, it is not very possible to give much\nindication of what to use and what to avoid, it being greatly a matter\nof practice, and somewhat of instinct, how to unite colour into\nbeautiful and complex groups A few hints for and against certain\ncombinations may perhaps be given: for instance, avoid placing a blue\nimmediately against a green of nearly the same tone; an outline of a\ndifferent colour disposes of this difficulty, but even so, blue and green\nfor equally leading colours should be avoided Again, red and yellow,\nif both of a vivid tone, will need a softening outline; also, I think, red\nand green if at all strong; avoid cold green in contact with misty blue-\ngreen, which in itself is rather a pretty colour: the warning seems\nfutile, but I have seen these colours used persistently together, and do\nnot like the resulting undecided gray tone A cold strong green\nrenders service sometimes, notably for placing against a clear brilliant\nyellow, which is apt to deaden certain softer greens Brown, when\nused, should be chosen carefully, warm in tint, but not hot; avoid the\nmixture of brown and yellow, often seen in \"Art Depôts,\" but not in\nnature, an unfortunate groping after the picturesque, as brown wants\ncooling down, and to marry it to a flaming yellow is not the way to do\nit Black should be used very sparingly indeed, though by no means\nbanished from the palette Blue and pink, blue and red, with a little\ntender green for relief, are perfectly safe combinations for the leading\ncolours in a piece of work; again, yellow and green, or yellow, pink,\nand green, make a delightfully fresh and joyous show There is a large\ncoverlet to be seen at the South Kensington Museum (in the Persian\ngallery) which is worked in these colours, all very much the same\nbright tone, the centre being green and yellow and pink, and the\nseveral borders the same, with the order and proportion altered to\nmake a variety In recalling bright colouring like this, one is reminded\nof Chaucer and his unfailing delight in gay colours, which he\n\n\nconstantly brings before us in describing garden, woodland, or\nbeflowered gown As—\n\"Everich tree well from his fellow grewe\nWith branches broad laden with leaves newe\nThat sprongen out against the sonne sheene\nSome golden red and some a glad bright grene \"\nOr, again, the Squire's dress in the Prologue to The Canterbury Tales—\n\"Embrouded was he, as it were a mede\nAlle ful of freshe floures, white and rede \"\nMay Morris FOOTNOTES:\n[1] For notes on the dyer's art and the nature of dye stuffs, see\nWilliam Morris's essay on \"Dyeing as an Art,\" p 196 [2] William Morris, \"Dyeing as an Art \"\n\n\nSTITCHES AND MECHANISM\nAs a guiding classification of methods of embroidery considered from\nthe technical point of view, I have set down the following heads:—\n(a) Embroidery of materials in frames (b) Embroidery of materials held in the hand (c) Positions of the needle in making stitches (d) Varieties of stitches (e) Effects of stitches in relation to materials into which\nthey are worked (f) Methods of stitching different materials together (g) Embroidery in relief (h) Embroidery on open grounds like net, etc (i) Drawn thread work; needlepoint lace (j) Embroidery allied to tapestry weaving In the first place, I define embroidery as the ornamental enrichment\nby needlework of a given material Such material is usually a closely-\nwoven stuff; but skins of animals, leather, etc , also serve as\nfoundations for embroidery, and so do nets (a) Materials to be embroidered may be either stretched out in a\nframe, or held loosely (b) in the hand Experience decides when either\nway is the better For embroidery upon nets, frames are indispensable The use of frames is also necessary when a particular aim of the\nembroiderer is to secure an even tension of stitch throughout his\nwork There are various frames, some large and standing on trestles;\nin these many feet of material can be stretched out Then there are\nsmall handy frames in which a square foot or two of material is\nstretched; and again there are smaller frames, usually circular, in\nwhich a few inches of materials of delicate texture, like muslin and\ncambric, may be stretched Oriental embroiderers, like those of China, Japan, Persia, and India,\nare great users of frames for their work (c) Stitches having peculiar or individual characteristics are\ncomparatively few Almost all are in use for plain needlework It is\nthrough the employment of them to render or express ornament or\npattern that they become embroidery stitches Some embroiderers and\nsome schools of embroidery contend that the number of embroidery\nstitches is almost infinite This, however, is probably one of the myths\nof the craft To begin with, there are barely more than two different\npositions in which the needle is held for making a stitch—one when\nthe needle is passed more or less horizontally through the material,\nthe other when the needle is worked more or less vertically In respect\nof the first-named way, the point of the needle enters the material\nusually in two places, and one pull takes the embroidery thread into\nthe material more or less horizontally, or along or behind its surface\n(Fig",
    "In respect\nof the first-named way, the point of the needle enters the material\nusually in two places, and one pull takes the embroidery thread into\nthe material more or less horizontally, or along or behind its surface\n(Fig 1) In the second, the needle is passed upwards from beneath the\nmaterial, pulled right through it, and then returned downwards, so\nthat there are two pulls instead of one to complete a single stitch Fig 1 —Stem Stitch—a peculiar use of short stitches Fig 1 —Stem Stitch—a peculiar use of short stitches A hooked or crochet needle with a handle is held more or less\nvertically for working a chain stitch upon the surface of a material\nstretched in a frame, but this is a method of embroidery involving the\nuse of an implement distinct from that done with the ordinary and\nfreely-plied needle Still, including this last-named method, which\ncomes into the class of embroidery done with the needle in a more or\nless vertical position, we do not get more than two distinctive\npositions for holding the embroidery needle Fig 2 —Chain Stitch Fig 2 —Chain Stitch (d) Varieties of stitches may be classified under two sections: one of\nstitches in which the thread is looped, as in chain stitch, knotted\nstitches, and button-hole stitch; the other of stitches in which the\nthread is not looped, but lies flatly, as in short and long stitches—\ncrewel or feather stitches as they are sometimes called,—darning\nstitches, tent and cross stitches, and satin stitch Fig 3 —Satin Stitch Fig 3 —Satin Stitch Almost all of these stitches produce different sorts of surface or\ntexture in the embroidery done with them Chain stitches, for\ninstance, give a broken or granular-looking surface (Fig 2) This effect\nin surface is more strongly marked when knotted stitches are used Satin stitches give a flat surface (Fig 3), and are generally used for\nembroidery or details which are to be of an even tint of colour Crewel or long and short stitches combined (Fig 4) give a slightly less\neven texture than satin stitches Crewel stitch is specially adapted to\nthe rendering of coloured surfaces of work in which different tints are\nto modulate into one another Fig 4 —Feather or Crewel Stitch—a mixture of long and\nshort stitches Fig 4 —Feather or Crewel Stitch—a mixture of long\nand short stitches (e) The effects of stitches in relation to the materials into which they\nare worked can be considered under two broadly-marked divisions The one is in regard to embroidery which is to produce an effect on\none side only of a material; the other to embroidery which shall\nproduce similar effects equally on both the back and front of the\nmaterial A darning and a satin stitch may be worked so that the\nembroidery has almost the same effect on both sides of the material Chain stitch and crewel stitch can only be used with regard to effect\non one side of a material (f) But these suggestions for a simple classification of embroidery do\nnot by any means apply to many methods of so-called embroidery, the\neffects of which depend upon something more than stitches In these\nother methods cutting materials into shapes, stitching materials\ntogether, or on to one another, and drawing certain threads out of a\nwoven material and then working over the undrawn threads, are\ninvolved Applied or appliqué work is generally used in connection\nwith ornament of bold forms The larger and principal forms are cut\nout of one material and then stitched down to another—the junctures\nof the edges of the cut-out forms being usually concealed and the\nshapes of the forms emphasised by cord stitched along them Patchwork depends for successful effect upon skill in cutting out the\n\n\nseveral pieces which are to be stitched together Patchwork is a sort of\nmosaic work in textile materials; and, far beyond the homely\npatchwork quilt of country cottages, patchwork lends itself to the\nproduction of ingenious counterchanges of form and colour in\ncomplex patterns These methods of appliqué and patchwork are\npeculiarly adapted to ornamental needlework which is to lie, or hang,\nstretched out flatly, and are not suited therefore to work in which is\ninvolved a calculated beauty of effect from folds (g) There are two or three classes of embroidery in relief which are\nnot well adapted to embroideries on lissome materials in which folds\nare to be considered Quilting is one of these classes It may be\nartistically employed for rendering low-relief ornament, by means of a\nstout cord or padding placed between two bits of stuff, which are then\nornamentally stitched together so that the cord or padding may fill\nout and give slight relief to the ornamental portions defined by and\nenclosed between the lines of stitching There is also padded\nembroidery or work consisting of a number of details separately\nwrought in relief over padding of hanks of thread, wadding, and such\nlike Effects of high relief are obtainable by this method Another\nclass, but of lower relief embroidery, is couching (Fig 5), in which\ncords and gimps are laid side by side, in groups, upon the face of a\nmaterial, and then stitched down to it Various effects can be obtained\nin this method The colour of the thread used to stitch the cords or\ngimp down may be different from that of the cords or gimp, and the\nstitches may of course be so taken as to produce small powdered or\ndiaper patterns over the face of the groups of cords or gimp Gold\ncords are often used in this class of work, which is peculiarly\nidentified with ecclesiastical embroideries of the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries, as also with Japanese work of later date Fig 5 —A form of Embroidery in relief, called\n\"Couching \"\nFig 5 —A form of Embroidery in relief, called\n\"Couching \"\n(h) The embroidery and work hitherto alluded to has been such as\nrequires a foundation of a closely woven nature, like linen, cloth, silk,\nand velvet But there are varieties of embroidery done upon netted or\nmeshed grounds And on to these open grounds, embroidery in\ndarning and chain stitches can be wrought For the most part the\n\n\nembroideries upon open or meshed grounds have a lace-like\nappearance In lace, the contrast between close work and open, or\npartially open, spaces about it plays an important part The methods\nof making lace by the needle, or by bobbins on a cushion, are totally\ndistinct from the methods of making lace-like embroideries upon net (i) Akin to lace and embroideries upon net is embroidery in which\nmuch of its special effect is obtained by the withdrawal of threads\nfrom the material, and then either whipping or overcasting in button-\nhole stitches the undrawn threads The Persians and embroiderers in\nthe Grecian Archipelago have excelled in such work, producing\nwondrously delicate textile grills of ingenious geometric patterns In\nthis drawn thread work, as it is called, we often meet with the\nemployment of button-hole stitching, which is an important stitch in\nmaking needlepoint lace (Fig 6) Fig 6 —Button-hole Stitching, as used in needlepoint lace Fig 6 —Button-hole Stitching, as used in needlepoint\nlace (j) We also meet with the use of a weaving stitch resembling in effect,\non a small scale, willow weaving for hurdles This weaving stitch, and\nthe method of compacting together the threads made with it, are\nclosely allied to that special method of weaving known as tapestry\nweaving Some of the earliest specimens of tapestry weaving consist of\nornamental borders, bands, and panels, which were inwoven into\ntunics and cloaks worn by Greeks and Romans from the fourth\ncentury before Christ, up to the eighth or ninth after Christ The scale\nof the work in these is so small, as compared with that of large\ntapestry wall-hangings of the fifteenth century, that the method may\nbe regarded as being related more to drawn thread embroidery than\nto weaving into an extensive field of warp threads A sketch of the different employments of the foregoing methods of\nembroidery is not to be included in this paper The universality of\nembroidery from the earliest of historic times is attested by evidences\nof its practice amongst primitive tribes throughout the world Fragments of stitched materials or undoubted indications of them\nhave been found in the remains of early American Indians, and in the\ncave dwellings of men who lived thousands of years before the period\nof historic Egyptians and Assyrians Of Greek short and long stitch,\n\n\nand chain stitch and appliqué embroidery, there are specimens of the\nthird or fourth century B C preserved in the Hermitage at St Petersburg",
    "Petersburg Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans were skilful\nin the use of tapestry weaving stitches Dainty embroidery, with\ndelicate silken threads, was practised by the Chinese long before\nsimilar work was done in the countries west of Persia, or in countries\nwhich came within the Byzantine Empire In the early days of that\nEmpire, the Emperor Theodosius I framed rules respecting the\nimportation of silk, and made regulations for the labour employed in\nthe gynæcea, the public weaving and embroidering rooms of that\nperiod, the development and organisation of which are traceable to\nthe apartments allotted in private houses to the sempstresses and\nembroideresses who formed part of the well-to-do households of early\nclassic times framed rules respecting the\nimportation of silk, and made regulations for the labour employed in\nthe gynæcea, the public weaving and embroidering rooms of that\nperiod, the development and organisation of which are traceable to\nthe apartments allotted in private houses to the sempstresses and\nembroideresses who formed part of the well-to-do households of early\nclassic times Alan S Cole Cole DESIGN\n\"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out\nof thine own well \"—Solomon \"Produce;

every animal form, or bird, fish or reptile, has been traced to its\nsource, and its symbolism laid bare Every phase of the world's primal\nschools of design—Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Greek,\nByzantine, European—has been illustrated and made easy of\nimitation We are archæologists: we are critics: we are artists We are\nlovers of old work: we are learned in historical and æsthetic questions,\nin technical rules and principles of design We are colourists, and can\nplay with colour as musicians play with notes What is more, we are\nin terrible earnestness about the whole business The honour of the\nBritish nation, the credit of Royalty, are, in a manner, staked upon the\nsuccess of our \"Schools of Needlework \" And yet, in spite of all these\nfavouring circumstances, we get no nearer to the old work that first\nmocked us to emulation in regard to power of initiative and human\ninterest Truth and gallantry prompt me to add, it is not in stitchery but in\ndesign that we lag behind the old Fair English hands can copy every\ntrick of ancient artistry: finger-skill was never defter, will was never\n\n\nmore ardent to do fine things, than now Yet our work hangs fire It\nfails in design Why Now, Emerson has well said that all the arts have their origin in some\nenthusiasm Mark this, however: that whereas the design of old\nneedlework is based upon enthusiasm for birds, flowers, and animal\nlife,[1] the design of modern needlework has its origin in enthusiasm\nfor antique art Nature is, of course, the groundwork of all art, even of\nours; but it is not to Nature at first-hand that we go The flowers we\nembroider were not plucked from field and garden, but from the\ncamphor-scented preserves at Kensington Our needlework conveys no\npretty message of\n\"The life that breathes, the life that lives,\"\nit savours only of the now stiff and stark device of dead hands Our art\nholds no mirror up to Nature as we see her, it only reflects the\nreflection of dead periods Nay, not content with merely rifling the\nmotifs of moth-fretted rags, we must needs turn for novelty to an old\nPersian tile which, well magnified, makes a capital design for a quilt\nthat one might perchance sleep under in spite of what is outside Or\nwe are not ashamed to ask our best embroideresses to copy the\nbarbaric wriggles and childlike crudities of a seventh-century \"Book of\nKells,\" a task which cramps her style and robs Celtic art of all its\nwonder We have, I said, realised our ideals We can do splendidly what we set\nourselves to do—namely, to mimic old masterpieces The question is,\nWhat next Shall we continue to hunt old trails, and die, not leaving\nthe world richer than we found it Or shall we for art and honour's\nsake boldly adventure something—drop this wearisome translation of\nold styles and translate Nature instead Think of the gain to the \"Schools,\" and to the designers themselves, if\nwe elect to take another starting-point No more museum-inspired\nwork No more scruples about styles No more dry-as-dust stock\npatterns No more loathly Persian-tile quilts No more awful\n\"Zoomorphic\" table-cloths No more cast-iron-looking altar cloths, or\nSyon Cope angels, or stumpy Norfolk-screen saints No more Tudor\nroses and pumped-out Christian imagery suggesting that Christianity\nis dead and buried But, instead, we shall have design by living men\n\n\nfor living men—something that expresses fresh realisations of sacred\nfacts, personal broodings, skill, joy in Nature—in grace of form and\ngladness of colour; design that shall recall Shakespeare's maid who\n\" with her neeld composes\nNature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,\nThat even Art sisters the natural roses \"\nFor, after all, modern design should be as the old—living thought,\nartfully expressed: fancy that has taken fair shapes And needlework is\nstill a pictorial art that requires a real artist to direct the design, a real\nartist to ply the needle Given these, and our needlework can be as\nfull of story as the Bayeux tapestry, as full of imagery as the Syon\nCope, and better drawn The charm of old embroidery lies in this, that\nit clothes current thought in current shapes It meant something to the\nworkers, and to the man in the street for whom it was done And for\nour work to gain the same sensibility, the same range of appeal, the\nsame human interest, we must employ the same means We must\nclothe modern ideas in modern dress; adorn our design with living\nfancy, and rise to the height of our knowledge and capacities Doubtless there is danger to the untrained designer in direct resort to\nNature For the tendency in his or her case is to copy outright, to give\nus pure crude fact and not to design at all Still there is hope in honest\nerror: none in the icy perfections of the mere stylist For the unskilled\ndesigner there is no training like drawing from an old herbal; for in all\nold drawing of Nature there is a large element of design Besides\nwhich, the very limitations of the materials used in realising a design\nin needlework, be it ever so naturally coloured, hinders a too definite\npresentation of the real For the professional stylist, the confirmed conventionalist, an hour in\nhis garden, a stroll in the embroidered meadows, a dip into an old\nherbal, a few carefully-drawn cribs from Curtis's Botanical Magazine,\nor even—for lack of something better—Sutton's last Illustrated\nCatalogue, is wholesome exercise, and will do more to revive the\noriginal instincts of a true designer than a month of sixpenny days at a\nstuffy museum The old masters are dead, but \"the flowers,\" as Victor\nHugo says, \"the flowers last always \"\nJohn D Sedding FOOTNOTES:\n[1] A strip of sixteenth-century needlework in my possession\n(6 ft by 2 ft 6 in ) figures thirty different specimens of plants,\nsix animals, and four birds, besides ornamental sprays of\nfoliage ON DESIGNING FOR THE ART OF\nEMBROIDERY\nIn every form of art the thing which is of primary importance is the\nquestion of Design By Design I understand the inventive arrangement of lines and\nmasses, for their own sake, in such a relation to one another, that they\nform a fine, harmonious whole: a whole, that is, towards which each\npart contributes, and is in such a combination with every other part\nthat the result is a unity of effect, so completely satisfying us that we\nhave no sense of demanding in it more or less After this statement and definition let me proceed to touch briefly\nupon four points in relation to the matter, as it concerns itself with\nthe art of Embroidery; and the first of these four points shall be this Before you commence your design, consider carefully the conditions\nunder which the finished work is to be seen There is a tendency in\nembroidery to be too uniformly delicate and minute To be too\ndelicate, or even minute, in something which is always to be seen\nclose under one's eyes is, it may be, impossible; but in an altar-cloth, a\nbanner, a wall-hanging, this delicacy and minuteness are not merely\nthrown away, but they tend to make the thing ineffective For such\nobjects as these I have mentioned, the main lines and masses of the\ndesign should, it would seem in the nature of the case, be well\nemphasised; if they are well emphasised, and of course fine in their\ncharacter and arrangement, there is produced a sense of largeness and\ndignity which is of the highest value, and for the absence of which no\namount of curious workmanship will atone In making your design, let\nthese main lines and masses be the first things you attend to, and\nsecure Stand away at a distance, and see if they tell out satisfactorily,\nbefore you go on to put in a single touch of detail For the second point: remember that embroidery deals with its objects\nas if they were all on the same plane It has been sometimes described\nas the art of painting with the needle; but it necessarily and\nessentially differs from the art of painting in this, that it, properly,\nrepresents all things as being equally near to you, as laid out before\nyou on the same plane It would seem, therefore, to be a sound rule to\n\n\nfill the spaces, left for you by the arrangement of your main lines and\nmasses, with such forms as shall occupy these spaces, one by one,\ncompletely; with such patterns, I mean, as shall appear to have their\nnatural and full development within the limits of each space: avoid\nthe appearance of one thing being behind the other, with portions of\nit cut off and obscured by what comes in front of it But in this, as in\nso much else, an immense deal must be left to the instinct of the\nartist Thirdly: aim at simplicity in the elements or motives of your design;\ndo not crowd it with a score of different elements, which produce a\nsense of confusion and irritation, and, in reality, prove only a poverty\nof invention A real richness of invention, as well as a richness of\neffect, lies in using one or two, perhaps at most three, elements, with\nvariety in the treatment of them Make yourself thoroughly master of\nthe essential points, in whatever elements you choose as the basis of\nyour design, before you set pencil to paper; and you will find in\nalmost any natural form you fix upon more than enough to give you\nall the variety and richness you require, if you have sufficient natural\nfancy to play with it Lastly: return again and again, and for evermore, to Nature The value\nof studying specimens of old embroidery is immense; it makes you\nfamiliar with the principles and methods, which experience has found\nto be true and useful; it puts you into possession of the traditions of\nthe art He that has no reverence for the traditions of his art seals his\nown doom; he that is careless about them, or treats them with\nsuperciliousness, or will not give the time and pains necessary to\nunderstand them, but thinks to start off afresh along clean new lines\nof his own, stamps himself as an upstart—makes himself perhaps, if\nhe is clever, a nine days' curiosity—but loses himself, by and by, in\nextravagances, and brings no fruit to perfection The study of old\nwork, then, is of the highest importance, is essential; the patient and\nhumble study of it",
