    "In\n\n\ncontrast to traditional subtractive and formative manufacturing techniques (e g g , machining and\n\n\ncasting), AM has intrinsic ability to build components with very complex structural geometries and\n\n\nhighly optimized mechanical/physical functionalities On the other hand, topology optimization,\n\n\nwhich aims at designing innovative and lightweight products by distributing material within a\n\n\nprescribed domain in an optimal way, has reached a certain level of maturity and becomes a\n\n\nwell-established research area [1-3] Up to now, many methods have been proposed for topology\n\n\noptimization and some of them have already been applied successfully in various application fields Although topology optimization has great potential to become a perfect design tool that can\n\n\nfully exploit the tremendous design freedom provided by AM, it must be admitted that existing\n\n\ntopology optimization approaches cannot be fully adapted to the current AM techniques This is\n\n\nbecause although seemingly a free-form manufacturing technique, AM does have some design\n\n\nlimitations which must be taken into account when AM oriented topology optimization approaches\n\n\nare devised for making topology optimization and AM an ideal fit These limitations can be\n\n\nsummarized briefly as follows (see also Fig 1 for a schematic illustration) Firstly, since 3D printing\n\n\nis achieved either by depositing material (in a Fused Deposition Modeling, FDM), applying focused\n\n\nlaser to cure powder (in Selective Laser Melting, SLM), spraying liquid binding onto particles (in\n\n\nInkjet Printing, IP) or by using some combinations of these approaches, the achievable smallest print\n\n\nresolution will inevitably be influenced by the parameters such as the nozzle diameter (in FDM) or\n\n\nthe beam width/offset in laser sintering [4] Therefore, optimal designs with too small feature sizes\n\n\n(e g",
    "g , the wall thickness or the diameter of a void) may not be fabricated even with AM technique Secondly, since in AM products are actually being built in a layer by layer way, each part of the\n\n\nproducts must be sufficiently supported from below during the manufacturing process otherwise the\n\n\nquality of the product cannot be fully guaranteed Usually, support material must be introduced to\n\n\nmanufacture certain structural topologies in order to prevent the structural material from being\n\n\ndistorted too much or even fail (due to high bending stresses) during the build process This\n\n#### Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, under review 2016-11-12 2\n\n\ntreatment, however, will waste print time, increase material usage and/or require chemical processing\n\n\nto remove the support material It is therefore highly desirable to design structures that are\n\n\nself-supporting during the course of AM Thirdly, the inclination of downward facing and\n\n\nnon-supported (overhang) surfaces cannot be at too large an angle with respect to the build direction The component with a high overhang angle may deform, droop or warp during the printing process The upper bound of the overhang angle is obvious material and process-dependent and has been\n\n\ninvestigated extensively in literature A commonly accepted value of the maximum overhang angle\n\n\namounts to 40 [°] -50 [° ] [5, 6] Lastly, there should be no enclosed voids existing in the structure\n\n\notherwise it will be very difficult to get the unmelted powder (in SLM) and support material (in\n\n\nFDM) out of the void once the structure is built up by AM Based on the above discussions, it can be\n\n\nconcluded that if topology optimization is expected to be used as a tool for innovative design purpose,\n\n\nthe above issues must be taken into consideration in order to guarantee that the corresponding\n\n\nproducts/structures can be successfully manufactured with AM The readers are also referred to\n\n\nBrackeet et al [7, 8] for an overview of the corresponding issues in AM oriented topology\n\n\noptimization Recent years witnessed an increasing interest to develop AM oriented topology optimization\n\n\napproaches by taking the aforementioned manufacturing constraints into consideration In order to\n\n\ncontrol the minimum length scale in topology optimization, both global implicit [9-11] and local\n\n\nexplicit [12-17] methods are developed We refer the readers to the above works and the references\n\n\ntherein for more recent advances on this aspect By introducing a virtual temperature field, Li et al developed an approach which can deal with connectivity constraint in topology optimization and\n\n\nproduce optimal designs without enclosed voids [18] In order to tackle the issues of designing of\n\n\nself-supporting structures and controlling overhang features, Leary et al",
    "In order to tackle the issues of designing of\n\n\nself-supporting structures and controlling overhang features, Leary et al [19] and Hu et al [20]\n\n\nproposed the post-processing methods to ensure the printability without introducing additive support\n\n\nmaterials This is achieved by modifying the theoretically optimal topologies to respect the overhang\n\n\nangle constraint In [7], the authors suggested first identifying the angles of overhang parts in\n\n\nstructures obtained by topology optimization and then achieving the overhang angle control by\n\n\nincorporating the corresponding constraints in optimization problem explicitly In [7], the authors suggested first identifying the angles of overhang parts in\n\n\nstructures obtained by topology optimization and then achieving the overhang angle control by\n\n\nincorporating the corresponding constraints in optimization problem explicitly No subsequent\n\n\nresearch work following this idea, however, can be found in literature Langelaar [21, 22] proposed\n\n#### Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, under review 2016-11-12 3\n\n\nan AM oriented topology optimization formulation to design self-supporting optimal structures\n\n\nwithout additional supporting materials To this end, the author developed a filter scheme that can\n\n\nincorporate the main characteristics of a typical AM process and implemented it in a density based\n\n\ntopology optimization approach It was reported that fully self-supporting can be obtained with use\n\n\nof this approach More recently, Gaynor and Guest [23] developed a topology optimization approach\n\n\nto produce self-supporting optimal designs In this approach, a series of projection operators that can\n\n\nenforce the minimum length scale constrains and restrict the overhang angles are introduced under\n\n\nthe variable density solution framework Numerical examples showed that self-supporting optimal\n\n\ndesigns satisfying minimum length scale, overhang angle and volume constraints do can be obtained\n\n\nwith use of this approach Although numerous efforts have been made to resolve the aforementioned printable issues\n\n\nassociated with AM processes, there is still room for further improvement For example, the\n\n\npost-processing methods suggested in [19] and [20] will inevitably introduce extra computational\n\n\nefforts and more importantly destroy the optimality of the original optimized designs Although the\n\n\n[strategy of introducing additional structures to a previously optimized design [19, 20] does can make](http://www baidu com/link url=mdf8GBQMkHJvi1eStCuHcRwjdR3guABHYr4CTRlL49mw1_-vdql8LovIj_iEd1EdORq6_ITzSCrOUvV6RaiT_OgjF5RFaJa0DZHN7Z3C0xO)\n\n\nit self-supporting, the mass of the structure, however, will increase substantially and the structure\n\n\nafter this treatment may deviate significantly from the originally optimized geometry [21] The\n\n\nproblem associated with the filter approach invented in [21] and [22] is that the filter functions\n\n\nintroduced are highly nonlinear and dependent on the regular mesh used for finite element analysis It is also found that there exist a relatively large number of elements with intermediate densities in\n\n\nsome optimized designs provided This phenomenon is obvious the side effect of the corresponding\n\n\nfilter operation It is also unclear how to optimize the build orientation in the proposed solution\n\n\napproach For the projection approach developed in [23], as pointed out by the authors, since the\n\n\ndetermination of structural topology and the corresponding sensitivity analysis must be carried out in\n\n\na layer-by-layer manner, the proposed approach is in general computationally inefficient Furthermore, for some problems, the involvement of multiple embedded nonlinear functions in the\n\n\nsolution scheme may also lead to convergence issues Compared to adding extra material or carrying out post-processing to make an optimal structure\n\n\nprintable, it is generally believed that designing self-supporting printable structures through topology\n\n#### Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, under review 2016-11-12 4\n\n\noptimization method directly is more preferable since it can simplify the post-processing and reduce\n\n\nthe manufacture cost In the present work, we intend to discuss how to design self-supporting\n\n\nstructures produced by AM without introducing support materials in a more explicit and geometrical\n\n\nway Our motivation is from the consideration that since the constraints associated with the designing\n\n\nof self-supporting structures (e g",
    "g , overhang angle, minimum length scale) are actually geometrical in\n\n\nnature, it seems more appropriate to include more geometry information in the mathematical\n\n\nformulation of the considered problem and perform topology optimization in an geometrically\n\n\nexplicit way (it is worth noting that topological design is usually achieved in an implicit way in\n\n\ntradition solution approaches such as variable density method and level set method, see [24-29] for\n\n\nmore detailed discussions on this aspect) Recent years witnessed a growing interest in solving\n\n\ntopology optimization problems by optimizing a set of geometrical parameters explicitly (i Recent years witnessed a growing interest in solving\n\n\ntopology optimization problems by optimizing a set of geometrical parameters explicitly (i e , a\n\n\nrevival of shape optimization) [17, 24-29] In particular, the so-called Moving Morphable\n\n\nComponents (MMC) and Moving Morphable Voids (MMV) where a set of components (in MMC) or\n\n\nvoids (in MMV) are used as basic building blocks of optimization have been developed As\n\n\ndemonstrated in the following sections, the MMC and MMV approaches can deal with the problem\n\n\nof designing self-supporting structures in a more natural way since more geometry information (e As\n\n\ndemonstrated in the following sections, the MMC and MMV approaches can deal with the problem\n\n\nof designing self-supporting structures in a more natural way since more geometry information (e g g ,\n\n\nthe outward normal vector of structural boundary, the inclined angle of a structural component) is\n\n\nembedded in the corresponding problem formulations In the present work, two approaches for\n\n\ndesigning AM oriented self-supporting structures established in the MMC and MMV solution\n\n\nframework are developed, respectively The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2, the proposed two solution\n\n\napproaches are presented and analyzed in detail Some theoretical issues associated with AM\n\n\noriented topology optimization are discussed in Section 3 Numerical solution aspects are addressed\n\n\nin Section 4 In Section 5, some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness\n\n\nof the proposed methods Finally some concluding remarks are provided in Section 6 #### **2",

to address this difficulty problem, only two dimensional\n\n\nproblems are considered in the present work **2 **2 1** **MMC-based approach**\n\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, a critical issue in topology optimization of self-supporting\n\n\nstructures is to control the inclined angles of structural components in the structure Under this\n\n\ncircumstance, the MMC-based explicit topology optimization approach first initialized in [24] where\n\n\nthe inclined angles of each component are adopted as design variables, is a natural choice to serve\n\n\nthis purpose In the following, a brief introduction of the basic idea of MMC will be given first As\n\n\npointed out in [24], unlike in traditional topology optimization approaches where structural\n\n\ntopologies are represented either by element densities (in variable density approach) or by nodal\n\n\nvalues of a level set function (in level set approach), in the MMC-based approach, a set of moving\n\n\nmorphable components are adopted as basic building blocks of topology optimization (see Fig 2 for\n\n\na schematic illustration) These components are allowed to move, deform, overlap and merge in the\n\n\ndesign domain freely, and optimal structural topology can be obtained by optimizing the positions,\n\n\ninclined angles, lengths, widths and the layout of these components This treatment provides a new\n\n\nparadigm for topology optimization and has big potential to resolve some challenging issues that\n\n\ncannot be dealt with easily by traditional methods We refer the readers to [24, 25, 27-29] for more\n\n\ndetails on the generalization and variants of this approach In the present work, as a preliminary attempt to generate self-supporting structures through\n\n\ntopology optimization, we propose to use structural components with hyperelliptic shapes as building\n\n\nblocks of topology optimization [24] Under this circumstance, the corresponding
