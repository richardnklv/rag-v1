phase-conjugator\n\nM Blaauboer, D Lenstra, and A Lodder\nFaculteit Natuurkunde en Sterrenkunde, Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1081, 1081 HV\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands\n(July 7, 2018)\n\n\nWe theoretically study reflection of light by a phase-conjugating mirror\npreceded by a partially reflecting normal mirror The presence of a suitably\nchosen normal mirror in front of the phase conjugator is found to greatly\nenhance the total phase-conjugate reflected power, even up to an order of\nmagnitude Required conditions are that the phase-conjugating mirror itself\namplifies upon reflection and that constructive interference of light in the\nregion between the mirrors takes place We show that the phase-conjugate\nreflected power then exhibits a maximum as a function of the transmittance\n\nof the normal mirror [PACS number(s): 42 65 Hw, 42 25 Bs, 42 68 Ay physics/9804003](http://arxiv org/abs/physics/9804003)\n\n\nIn recent years, the interesting role that phase conjugation can play in mesoscopic physics\nhas received considerable attention Phase conjugation is the general term for a process in\nwhich both the direction of propagation and the overall phase factor of a wave function are\nreversed [1] A famous example is Andreev reflection [2], the electron-to-hole reflection at an\ninterface between a normal metal and a superconductor in a mesoscopic system Mesoscopic\nmeans, by definition, that the dimensions of the system are small enough for phase-coherence\nto be preserved in the entire configuration, in this case the normal metal–superconductor\njunction, but still much larger than the Fermi wavelength of the normal metal In this regime\nit is interesting to study the influence of Andreev reflection on transport properties such as\nthe conductance of the sample The basis of a theoretical approach to this kind of transport\nproblems was in fact laid as early as 1957 by Landauer, long before the advent of mesoscopic\nphysics He related the electrical conductance of a normal metal to its quantum mechanical\ntransmission matrix, the well-known Landauer formula [3,4] This reflection/transmission\nmatrix approach turned out to be very useful in mesoscopic transport problems, also in\ncombination with phase conjugation For example, Beenakker [5] derived a ”Landauertype” formula for the conductance of a normal metal-superconductor junction, which allows\nfor studying both clean and disordered normal metals in the presence of Andreev reflection This paper is concerned with the optical counterpart of Andreev reflection, namely probeto-conjugate reflection of light at a phase-conjugating mirror (PCM) [1] The dimensions of\na PCM are much larger than those of a mesoscopic superconducting system and allow for a\nclassical treatment of the transport properties of light Despite this different scale, a PCM\nsystem is mesoscopic in the sense that it is larger than the wavelength, but smaller than the\ncoherence length of the light reflecting at it Electronic and optical phase conjugation display\nan interesting analogy [6,7] and also optical phase conjugation can conveniently be described\nusing a reflection/transmission formalism Recently this was used to study reflection of light\nat a phase-conjugating mirror behind a disordered optical medium in a waveguide [8] 1\n\n\nIn view of the time-reversal properties of a phase-conjugating mirror, whereby accumulated phase-shifts are cancelled when the phase-conjugated wave travels back along the path\nof the original incoming wave, it is intruiging to combine it with a normal reflector By\nnormal reflector we mean a scattering region in which only specular reflections take place,\neg the disordered medium in [8] Here we consider the simplest possible normal reflector,\na partially transmitting normal mirror We analyze the phase-conjugate reflected power for\nplane wave illumination of a configuration consisting of a phase-conjugating mirror preceded\nby a partially reflecting normal mirror A lot of work has been done on this kind of resonator\nstructures involving combinations of normal mirrors and phase-conjugating mirrors [9] Here\nwe describe an interesting effect in a normal mirror–phase-conjugating mirror arrangement,\nwhich to our knowledge has been unnoticed so far When the PCM is operating such that\nit amplifies the incoming light upon phase-conjugate reflection and multiply reflected waves\nin the region between the mirrors interfere constructively, we find a dramatic enhancement\nof the phase-conjugate reflected intensity compared with that at the same PCM alone The\nphase-conjugate reflectance, defined as the reflected power divided by the incident power, is\nmaximal for a suitably chosen value of the transmittance of the normal mirror and reaches\n∼ 10 times its value at the PCM alone The phase-conjugating mirror consists of a cell filled with an optical medium with a large\nthird-order susceptibility χ [(3)] The medium is pumped by two intense counterpropagating\nlaser beams of frequency ω 0 When a weak probe beam of frequency ω 0 + δ is incident on the\nmaterial, a fourth beam will be generated due to the nonlinear polarization of the medium\n(four-wave mixing) This so-called conjugate wave propagates with frequency ω 0 − δ in the\nopposite direction as the probe beam [1] In the medium, the coupling between probe and\nconjugate waves is described by the equations [6]\n\n\n\n− [c] [2]\n\n 2ω\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc [2] ∂ [2]\nγ

    "The constructive interference of multiply reflected waves is also essential\nfor obtaining the maximum Fig Fig 2 shows that for L = 2 cm (or, equivalently, φ ≈ π/3), R c\nalways decreases with T, even though the PCM still acts as an amplifier The advantage of\nadditional multiple reflections, as the transmittance of the normal mirror becomes less, then\ncannot overcome the disadvantage of less primary light arriving at the PCM Note that a\nfinite distance L is not necessary for obtaining the maximum The curve for L = 0 shows\nthat a suitably chosen coating on the PCM also gives rise to enhancement of R c In this\ncase the effect is very sensitive to the detuning frequency δ which, as seen from (6) with\nL = 0, has to satisfy the condition δ ≪ γ 0 in order for φ to be close to zero From (6) we see that R c becomes infinite if cos φ = 1 and T = 1 − 1/R pcm This happens\nin the upper curve of Fig 2, for L = 15 cm It is interesting to compare this with the work of\nPaasschens et al who obtained qualitatively the same divergent behavior in a more complex\nsystem [8] They studied reflection of light at a two-dimensional random medium consisting\nof dielectric rods backed by a phase-conjugating mirror For diffusive illumination of the\ndisordered medium and for δ ≫ τ dwell [−][1] [, with][ τ] [dwell] [ the dwell time of a photon in the medium,]\ninterference effects are shown to be negligible Disregarding angular correlations between\nmultiply reflected waves in the region between the random medium and the PCM then leads\nto a phase-conjugate reflected power of\n\n\nT [2] R\npcm\nR c = (8)\n1 − (1 − T ) [2] R pcm [2]\n\n\nThe same expression is obtained when averaging (6) over the phase φ [13] (8) again shows\nthe divergence of R c for T = 1 − 1/R pcm As was explained in [8], this is due to some\nlight becoming trapped in the intermirror region as T decreases Repetitive reflections at\nthe PCM, provided R pcm - 1, then lead to the enormous increase in the phase-conjugate\nreflectance Since R c is limited by the intensity of the pump beams, one now needs to take\ninto account the effects of pump depletion and the analysis breaks down close to and beyond\nT = 1 − 1/R pcm The same phenomenon occurs in our one-dimensional system for certain values of L [14] This is illustrated in Fig 3, which shows the phase-conjugate reflected intensity as a function\nof the intermirror distance L for a normal mirror with transmittance of 60 % The horizontal\nline in the figure indicates the reflectance of the PCM alone, R pcm 5\n\n\n##### 15 10 5 0\n##### 0 10 20 30 40 L (cm)\n\nFIG 3",
    "3 Phase-conjugate reflectance at a normal mirror with transmittance T = 0 6 followed by a\nphase-conjugating mirror Parameters used are L pcm = 1 cm, δ = 0 1 [c/L pcm ] and γ 0 = 1 [c/L pcm ] The horizontal line marks the phase-conjugate reflectance at the PCM alone, R pcm = 2 The horizontal line marks the phase-conjugate reflectance at the PCM alone, R pcm = 2 4 4 It is clear that the presence of the normal mirror at a suitably chosen distance L, such\nthat φ is close to a multiple of 2π, but sufficiently far away from it to avoid the effects of\npump depletion, gives a giant enhancement of R c with respect to R pcm In conclusion, we have theoretically analyzed the phase-conjugate reflected power at a\nnormal mirror followed by a phase-conjugating mirror For plane wave illumination of this\nmirror arrangement, and taking advantage of multiple reflection effects in the resonator\nregion between the mirrors, a giant enhancement of the phase-conjugate reflectance is predicted with respect to that of the PCM alone Necessary conditions are that reflection at the\nphase-conjugating mirror is accompagnied by amplification, and that constructive interference of waves occurs in front of the PCM If either condition is not satisfied, the presence of\nthe normal mirror only decreases the phase-conjugate reflectance This also happens in the\nanalogous electronic configuration, a normal metal-superconductor interface preceded by a\nnormal scattering region: since Andreev reflection occurs with at most unity amplitude, the\nhole reflectance decreases with increasing normal scattering [15] In previous work on resonators involving a normal mirror and a phase-conjugating mirror\n\n[9] various ways of output power enhancement of the resonator were found",
    "In previous work on resonators involving a normal mirror and a phase-conjugating mirror\n\n[9] various ways of output power enhancement of the resonator were found For example,\nPepper et al For example,\nPepper et al [16] reported amplified phase-conjugate reflection using degenerate four-wave\nmixing (δ = 0) and a fully reflecting normal mirror in combination with a PCM Under\nsuitably chosen operating conditions of the PCM they observed a finite conjugate output\nsignal in the absence of any input probe signal, the output being directly generated by\n\n\n6\n\n\nthe pump beams [17] Under\nsuitably chosen operating conditions of the PCM they observed a finite conjugate output\nsignal in the absence of any input probe signal, the output being directly generated by\n\n\n6\n\n\nthe pump beams [17] Feinberg et al Feinberg et al [18] obtained similar self-oscillatory behavior using a\nperfectly reflecting normal mirror behind a PCM Our configuration differs from these resonators, since it gives the phase-conjugate response to an input probe signal passed through a partially transmitting normal mirror Enhancement of this response occurs both for frequencies δ = 0 (degenerate four-wave mixing) and δ ̸= 0 (non-degenerate four-wave mixing), and in a broad range of intermirror\ndistances L This allows for frequency discrimination between probe and conjugate output\nwaves and regularization of the enhancement by choosing an appropriate value of L for fixed\nδ, or vice versa Finally, as an example, consider a realistic phase-conjugating mirror of length L pcm =\n1 cm, with a coupling strength γ 0 = 10 [10] s [−][1] and illuminated by monochromatic light of\nfrequency δ ∼ 10 [9] s [−][1] detuned from the pump frequency The phase-conjugate reflectance\nR pcm ∼ 2, which is well within experimental reach [19] We predict that placing a ≈ 60%\ntransmitting normal mirror at a distance of L ≈ 14 cm in front of this PCM increases the\nphase-conjugate reflected power by an order of magnitude and hope that this will present a\nchallenge to experimentalists Part of this work was supported by the ”Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der\nMaterie” (FOM) which is part of the ”Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek” (NWO) [1] Optical Phase Conjugation, edited by R A Fisher (Academic Press, New York, 1983) [2] A F Andreev, Zh Eksp Teor Fiz",
