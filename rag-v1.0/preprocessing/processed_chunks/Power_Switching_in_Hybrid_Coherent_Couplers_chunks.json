    "## Power Switching in Hybrid Coherent Couplers\n\nW D Deering [1] and M I I Molina [2]\n\n\n1 Center for Nonlinear Science, Department of Physics\nUniversity of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203, USA\n\n\n2 Departamento de F´ısica, Facultad de Ciencias\nUniversidad de Chile\n\nCasilla 653, Santiago, Chile\n\n\n1\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe report on a theoretical and numerical investigation of the switching\nof power in new hybrid models of nonlinear coherent couplers consisting of\noptical slab waveguides with various orders of nonlinearity The first model\nconsists of two guides with second-order instead of the usual third-order\nsusceptibilities as typified by the Jensen coupler This second-order system\nis shown to have a power self-trapping transition at a critical power greater\nthan the third-order susceptibility coupler Next, we consider a mixed coupler\ncomposed of a second-order guide coupled to a third-order guide and show\nthat, although it does not display a rigorous self-trapping transition, for\na particular choice of parameters it does show a fairly abrupt trapping of\npower at a lower power than in the third-order coupler By coupling this\nmixed nonlinear pair to a third, purely linear guide, the power trapping can\nbe brought to even lower levels and in this way a satisfactory switching profile\ncan be achieved at less than one sixth the input power needed in the Jensen\ncoupler 2\n\n\n##### 1 Introduction\n\nInterest in all-optical switching devices has led to the study and design of several promising configurations of nonlinear couplers which display intensitytriggered power switching The basic nonlinear coherent coupler, introduced\nby Jensen [1], consists of two similar waveguides made of a material with\nthird-order susceptibilities, embedded in a host with purely linear susceptibility When the guides are placed parallel to each other and in close\nproximity over a given distance, the guide fields overlap to some extent and\npower can be transferred between the two When all the power is initially\nlaunched into one of the guides, the nonlinear susceptibility can give rise to\nself-trapping of power in the original guide The output power in the original\nguide, for a device length equal to a coupling length, can be made to switch\nfrom essentially zero percent at low power levels, to one hundred percent for\ninput power levels exceeding a characteristic threshold In addition to the\npioneering work by Jensen, several other coupler configurations have been\nconsidered It was found that a three-in-a-line configuration of couplers displays a more abrupt switching profile, at the expense however, of greater\ninput power[2] The same tendency was reported for a linear array of many\ncouplers[3] In an effort to improve the switching profile, we introduced in a\nrecent work[4] the Doubly Nonlinear Trimer (DNT) coupler consisting of two\nnonlinear guides coupled to a third, linear guide Such a system displays the\ninteresting phenomenon of power self-trapping tunability: the critical input\npower level necessary for the onset of power self-trapping can be tuned to low\nvalues, by adjusting the value of the (linear) coupling between the nonlinear\nguides and the linear one [4],[5] In the optimal configuration, switching was\nachieved at one-fourth the power needed to produce switching in the Jensen\ncoupler The price to pay for this improved switching is the use of larger\ndevice lengths, up to ten times that reported by Jensen[4] In the present work, our interest is in learning if couplers having waveguides with differing types of nonlinear susceptibilities would have better\nswitching characteristics than other standard models We first investigate\na different nonlinear coupler composed of two identical guides made of optical material lacking inversion symmetry and therefore having a nonvanishing\n\n\n3\n\n\nsecond-order susceptibility We show that this new coupler array possesses\na power self-trapping transition and an associated sharp power switching\nprofile, albeit at a larger input power level than in Jensen’s and in our earlier DNT coupler Then, after examining a number of two-guide couplers of\nmixed compositions, with each guide having purely linear (L), and secondorder (SO) or the usual third-order (TO) susceptibilities we found that for a\nparticular choice of parameters, a coupler composed of an SO guide and a TO\nguide displays a relatively sharp power self-trapping profile at an input power\nlevel lower than previously reported, if power is initially launched in the SO\nguide Next, as in the DNT case, the onset of self-trapping can be tuned\nto even lower power levels, by perturbing the two-guide coupler by adding\na purely linear control guide and adjusting the strength of the interaction\nwith this third guide The resulting three-guide coupler, dubbed SO-TO-L,\nresembles the DNT configuration, with one of the third-order guides replaced\nby a second-order guide; it displays a reasonably sharp switching profile and,\nas far as we know, does so at the lowest input power reported so far ##### 2 A new two-guide coupler\n\n\nConsider a linearly coupled system of two nonlinear guides, each having the\nsame second-order nonlinear susceptibility In the single mode approximation, the normalized mode amplitudes satisfy\n\n\ni [dC] [1] = V C 2 − χ|C 1 |C 1 (1)\n\ndz\n\ni [dC] [2] = V C 1 − χ|C 2 |C 2, (2)\n\ndz\n\n\n\nwhere χ = Q [(2)] [√] P is the product of an integral Q [(2)] containing the second\norder nonlinear susceptibility[1] and the square root of the input power P The linear coupling of the guides is determined by the coefficient V With all\nthe power initially launched in guide 1, the initial conditions are C 1 (0) = 1,\nC 2 (0) = 0 We will now show that Eqns (1)-(2) predicts a self-trapping of\npower in the original guide (guide 1) First, it is convenient to rewrite (1-2)\nas a set of four equations for the complex quantities ρ ij ≡ C i C j [∗] [:]\n\n\n\ni [dρ] [11] = −V (ρ 12 − ρ 21 ) (3)\n\ndz\n\n\n4\n\n\ni [dρ] [22] = V (ρ 12 − ρ 21 ) (4)\n\ndz\n\ni [dρ] [12] = −V (ρ 11 − ρ 22 )\n\ndz\n\n+χ( [√] ρ 22 − [√] ρ 11 )ρ 12 (5)\n\ni [dρ] [21] = V (ρ 11 − ρ 22 )\n\ndz\n\n−χ( [√] ρ 22 − [√] ρ 11 )ρ 21 (6)\n\n\nWe have two conserved quantities: the total power, normalized to unity:\nρ 11 + ρ 22 = 1 and the total “energy” H = V (ρ 12 + ρ 21 ) − (2/3)χ(ρ [3] 11 [/][2] [+]\nρ 22 [3][/][2] [) =][ −][(2][/][3)][χ][ leaving only two independent unknowns, which precludes]\nany chaotic dynamics for the system Making use of these conserved quantities we find, after some tedious algebra, the following first-order equation\nfor ρ 11 ≡ ρ:\n1\n\n(7)\n\n2 [(] [dρ] dz [)] [2] [ +][ U][(][ρ][) = 0]\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\n� 2\n\n\n\nU(ρ) = −2ρ(1 − ρ) + [1]\n\n2\n\n\n\n2χ\n� 3V\n\n\n\n\n[2]\n\n3 [ρ] [3][/][2] [(1][ −] [ρ][)] �\n\n\n\n− [2]\n\n3\n\n\n\nχ\n� V\n\n\n\n2\n� �\n\n\n\n1 − ρ − [2]\n� 3\n\n\n\n− [1]\n\n3 [(][ρ] [3] [ + (1][ −] [ρ][)] [3] [)]\n\n+ [2] (8)\n\n3 [(][ρ] [3][/][2] [ + (1][ −] [ρ][)] [3][/][2] [)][ ]\n\n\nEquation (7) describes a classical particle of unit mass, moving under the\ninfluence of an external potential U(ρ), with initial condition ρ(0) = 1 Fig 1\nshows the effective potential U(ρ) for several different values of χ/V For\nsmall nonlinearity values, the effective potential is concave and conservation of energy allows complete oscillations of the “particle”; that is, power\nis transferred between the two guides As nonlinearity (input power) is increased, the potential develops a local maximum whose height increases with\nincreasing nonlinearity The condition for self-trapping of power in the original guide translates here into the condition for the potential U(ρ) to develop\na double root at ρ = ρ [∗] for some critical value of χ/V, i e , U(ρ [∗] ) = 0 and\n\n\n5\n\n\n(dU/dρ) ρ ∗ = 0 Close examination of Eq (8) and Fig 1 reveals U(ρ) to be\neven around ρ = 1/2 and that ρ [∗] = 1/2 From that, the critical value of the\nnonlinearity is obtained in closed form as\n\n\n\n��\n\n\n\nχ\n� V\n\n\n\n� c [=]\n\n\n\n3\n� √2\n\n\n\n3 + 2√\n\n\n\n2 ≈ 5 121 (9)\n\n\n\nThis value is greater than the critical values for Jensen’s coupler (= 4) and\n≈ 4 for the array of three nonlinear (third-order) couplers [2] ( 5) Figure 2\nshows the average transmittance of the guide, defined as\n\n\nL\n< P >≡ lim (10)\nL→∞ [(1][/L][)] � 0 [ρ][(][z][)][dz ]\n\n\nClearly, we see that for (χ/V ) < (χ/V ) c, power is equally distributed between\nthe two guides At (χ/V ) = (χ/V ) c, an abrupt transition takes place and\npower begins to self-trap in the original guide Onset of self-trapping is a\nprecursor for the appearance of a sharp switching profile in the transmittance\nof the guide The transmittance, defined as |C 1 (L c )| [2], is the quantity of basic\ninterest for optics The length L c is usually chosen as the shortest length\nfor which |C 1 (z)| [2] is zero, or very nearly so, in the absence of nonlinearity\n(χ = 0) In the case of the two waveguide system, L c = π/(2V ) The\nabrupt increase in transmittance caused by an increment of the nonlinearity\nparameter (input power) can be used as a power triggered switch[1] Figure 3 shows the transmittance characteristics of our two-guide secondorder (SO) coupler, and compares it with Jensen’s third-order (TO) nonlinear\ncoupler which is also shown in the figure, along with the TO nonlinear coupler\nwith three guides[2] We note the SO nonlinear coupler array does not have\na competitive switching profile compared to Jensen’s and the three-coupler\n\narray ##### 3 A New Hybrid Configuration\n\n\nAfter considering the above nonlinear coupler, having second-order susceptibility, we next examined a variety of mixed two-guide couplers in which each\nguide was either a purely linear one, a SO or a TO guide The objective was\nto find other two-guide couplers that displayed power self-trapping for the\ninitial condition where all the initial power is put into one guide We found\n\n\n6\n\n\nthat, in most cases there is no self-trapping transition at all but a continuous\npower trapping For a given mixed two-guide coupler, the trapping profile\ndepends in a sensitive way on the order of the nonlinear susceptibility of the\nguide initially receiving all power To illustrate this point, we now describe\nthe most interesting case we found: The SO-TO guide system, where guide 1\npossesses a second-order nonlinear susceptibility integral[1] Q [(2)] 1 and guide 2\npossesses the usual third-order susceptibility integral[1] Q [(3)] 2 [ The equations]\nfor the mode amplitudes are\n\ni [dC] [1] = V C 2 − χ 1 |C 1 |C 1 (11)\n\ndz\n\ni [dC] [2] = V C 1 − χ 2 |C 2 | [2] C 2, (12)\n\ndz\n\nwhere χ 1 = Q [(2)] 1 √P and χ 2 = Q [(3)] 2 [P] [ When all initial input power goes into]\n\nthe TO guide (#2), the initial condition for the system, Eqns (11)-(12),\nis C 1 (0) = 0, C 2 (0) = 1 A numerical investigation of < P > reveals a\n“delayed” self-trapping transition at χ 1 = χ 2 = χ c ≈ 6 3 V (Fig 4) This\nvalue is much greater than Jensen’s and is, therefore, not useful for our\npurposes On the other hand, when all input power is put initially into the\nSO guide (#1), we have the initial condition C 1 (0) = 1, C 2 (0) = 0 In this\ncase, a numerical search reveals that this system does not show a self-trapping\ntransition: the effective potential U(ρ, χ 1, χ 2 ) does not develop a double root\nfor any combination of χ 1, χ 2 However, for the special case χ 1 = χ 2 ≡ χ, we\nfound a relatively sharp power self-trapping profile occurring at χ ≈ 3 0 V\n(Fig 4); i e , a smaller power than Jensen’s critical value for self-trapping We then proceeded to “tune” the trapping profile to even lower power levels,\nby allowing the SO-TO coupler to interact linearly with a third (control)\nguide possessing only linear susceptibility The enlarged set of equations for\nthe mode amplitudes in this SO-TO-L coupler now reads\n\ni [dC] [1] = V C 2 + WC 3 − χ|C 1 |C 1 (13)\n\ndz\n\ni [dC] [2] = V C 1 + WC 3 − χ|C 2 | [2] C 2 (14)\n\ndz\n\ni [dC] [3] = W (C 1 + C 2 ), (15)\n\ndz\n\n\nwith initial conditions C 1 (0) = 1, C 2 (0) = C 3 (0) = 0 It is assumed here that\nthe guides have the same linear susceptibility, to minimize possible phase\n\n\n7\n\n\nmismatch effects After examining < P > as a function of χ for different W\nvalues, we found that W ≈ 1 1V brings the onset of self-trapping down to a\npower level χ ≈ 0 4 V Note that this optimal W value is the same as found\nfor the DNT coupler[4] Now, to evaluate the transmittance of this SO-TO-L\narray, we need to calculate the coupling length L c (W ) This is obtained from\nEqns (13)-(15) as the position z at which |C 1 (z)| [2] ≈ 0, for χ = 0 In this\nlimit the system of equations can be solved in closed form[4] and yields for\n|C 1 (z)| [2] :\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\nz\n�\n\n\n\n|C 1 (z)| [2] = A cos\n\n\n\n�� 3V − √\n\n\n\nV [2] + 8W [2]\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\nz\n�\n\n\n\n+B cos\n\n\n\n�� 3V + √\n\n\n\nV [2] + 8W [2]\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n+C cos[√\n\n\n\nV [2] + 8W [2] z] + D, (16)\n\n\n\nwhere\nA = � √V [2] + 8W [2] − V � / � 4√\n\n\n\nV [2] + 8W [2]\n�\n\n\n\nB = � √V [2] + 8W [2] + V � / � 4√V [2] + 8W [2] �\n\nC = W [2] / � V [2] + 8W [2] [�]\n\n\n\nD = � V [2] + 4W [2] [�] / � 4 � V [2] + 8W [2] [��] + 1/4 For W = 1 1 V, Eqn (16) gives L c ≈ 21/V, the same value as for the DNT\ncoupler Figure 5 shows the transmittance of the SO-TO-L system as a\nfunction of input power, for the optimal linear coupling value W = 1 1V For\ncomparison we also show the transmittance for the DNT coupler Jensen’s\ndevice switches at about χ = 4V and the side-by-side three-nonlinear guide\ncoupler of ref 2 switches at about χ ∼ 4 5 V, but because of the scale of the\nfigure, neither of these transitions is shown We note that the new coupler\nconfiguration SO-TO-L is capable of achieving over 99% power switching for\ninput power levels below χ ∼ 0 65 V which is a 48% reduction in input power\nneeded compared to the DNT device 8\n\n\n##### 4 Discussion\n\nIn order for the above results to be meaningful, it must be true that χ 2 and\nχ 3 can be at least approximately equal for some materials These coefficients involve the usual susceptibilities χ [(][j][)] defined here to give the electric\npolarization P E in the form\n\n\nP Ei = ǫ 0 � χ [(1)] ij [E] [j] [+][ χ] [(2)] ijk [E] [j] [E] [k] [ +][ χ] [(3)] ijkm [E] [j] [E] [k] [E] [m] [ +][ · · ·] � To find the ratio χ 2 /χ 3 = Q 2 / � Q 3 √P �, we use the definitions from ref 1\n\nof the integrals Q 2 and Q 3, inserting the exact expressions for mode fields\nand susceptibilities Rather than going through those calculations, we make\nthe simplifying assumptions that the χ [(][j][)] are constant across each guide and\nthat the mode field is also constant (approximately true for the TE 0 mode)\nacross the guide; then the integrals are easily done and we get\n\n\n\nχ [(2)]\nχ 2 /χ 3 ≃\n\nχ [(3)] |E| √\n\n\n\nP [,]\n\n\n\nwhere P is the input power and |E| is the amplitude of a slab waveguide\nmode field, normalized to one watt/meter Then the ratio χ 2 /χ 3 can be on\nthe order of unity within the range of known values of the susceptibilities[6]\nand power in the range 0 01 - 1 kw As mentioned previously, the critical length L c for the SO coupler is the\nsame as for the Jensen coupler, but the SO device switches less abruptly\nand at higher power than Jensen’s The SO-TO coupler shows final-state\nasymmetry depending on which guide receives input power If power enters\nthe TO leg, a self-trapping transition occurs at more than 1 5 times the\nJensen level, P J If the SO leg receives the power, a relatively sharp selftrapping sets in at about 25% below P J A greatly lowered power switching level is shown by SO-TO-L, but its\nL c is an order of magnitude larger than the Jensen L c Typical values for L c\nare about a millimeter[7] for weakly coupled devices ( i e",
    "e , the separations\nbetween waveguides are large enough that coupled-mode theory can be used)\nand less for stronger coupling Then L c for SO-TO-L is on the order of a\ncentimeter or less The linear interaction coefficients V and W are overlap integrals, across\none waveguide, of the product of the electric mode field of that guide and\n\n\n9\n\n\nthe mode field of a second guide Therefore, V and W are functions of\nthe separation of the waveguides and in principle, it is possible to alter one\nwithout changing the other; that is, the system can be tuned to achieve\nminimum power switching level, by changing the distances between the linear\nguide and the other two, nonlinear guides ##### 5 Conclusions\n\n\nOur primary interest was the investigation of switching characteristics of\nmodel nonlinear couplers having mixtures of waveguides, not necessarily with\nthe same orders of nonlinear susceptibilities Earlier work on the DNT system suggested tunability might also be used in a hybrid coupler to decrease\nswitching power levels It appears possible to meet the condition χ 2 [∼] = χ 3,\nas far as known values of these quantities are concerned Whether specific\nmaterials can be found that meet this condition and are also compatible with\none another in a device, is another matter and one we have not addressed in\nthis paper Switching characteristics of SO is inferior to the TO system For SO-TO,\nthe asymmetry of final states with respect to input guide may be the only\naspect of its performance that could be of interest The most interesting coupler was the SO-TO-L, formed by adding a linear\nguide to SO-TO and tuning for minimum power by adjusting the relative\npositions of the guides The transition power level drops to less than onesixth of P J Although a disadvantage of this coupler is a critical length that\nis longer than for the Jensen coupler by an order of magnitude, that may be\ntolerable in some applications Of course, there are various other configurations involving arrays of these\ncouplers but those were not investigated One of the authors (M I M ) acknowledges support from FONDECYT\ngrant 1950655 ##### References\n\n\n[1] S M Jensen, ”Nonlinear Coherent Coupler”, IEEE J Quantum Electron,\nvol 18, pp 1580-1583, 1982 10\n\n\n[2] N Finlayson and G I",
