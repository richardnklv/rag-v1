1997\n1991 Math Subj Class 51N30, 51p05, 53-XX\n\n\n1\n\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nA number of physical problems connected with the general interior dynamics\nof deformable particles while moving within inhomogeneous and anisotropic\nphysical media result in a study of the most general known systems which\nare nonlinear in coordinates x and their derivatives ˙x, ¨x, , on wave functions and ψ and their derivatives ∂ψ, ∂∂ψ, Such systems are also nonlocal\nbecause of possible integral dependencies on all of the proceeding quantities\nand noncanonical with violation of integrability conditions for the existence\nof a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian [19] The mathematical methods for a quantitative treatment of the latter\nnonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian systems have been identified by\nSantilli in a series of contributions beginning the late 1970’s [20, 21, 23]\nunder the name of isotopies, and include axiom preserving liftings of fields\nof numbers, vector and metric spaces, differential and integral calculus,\nalgebras and geometries These studies were then continued by a number\nof authors (see ref [4] for a comprehensive literature up to 1985, and\nmonographs [10, 12, 19, 21, 22, 26] for subsequent literature) This paper is devoted to a study of Santilli’s isospaces and isogeometries over isofields treated via the isodifferential calculus according to their\nlatest formulation [22] (we extend this calculus for isospaces provided with\nnonlinear isoconnection structure) We shall also use Kadeisvili’s notion\nof isocontinuity [10] and the novel Santilli–Tsagas–Sourlas isodifferential\ntopology [23, 26] After reviewing the basic elements for completeness as well as for notational convenience, we shall extend Santilli’s foundations of the isosympletic\ngeometry [23] to isobundles and related aspects (by applying, in an isotopic\nmanner, the methods summarized in Miron and Anastasiei [14] and Yano\nand Ishihara [34] monographs) We shall study, apparently for the first time,\nthe isotopies of Lagrange, Finsler and Kaluza–Klein geometries We shall\nthen apply the results to further studies of the isogravitational theories (for\nisoriemannian spaces firstly considered by Santilli [23]) on vector isobundle provided with compatible nonlinear and distinguished isoconnections\nand isometric structures Such isogeometrical models of isofield interaction\nisotheories are in general nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian and contain a very large class of local anisotropies and inhomogeneities induced by\n\n\n2\n\n\nfour fundamental isostructures: the partition of unity, nonlinear isoconnection, distinguished isoconnections and isometric The novel geometric profile emerging from all the above studies is rather\nremarkable inasmuch as the first class of all isotopies herein considered\n(called Kadeisvili’s Class I [10]) preserves the abstract axioms of conventional formulations, yet permits a clear broadening of their applicability,\nand actually result to be ”directly universal” [23] for a number of possible\nwell behaved nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian systems In turn, this\npermits a number of geometric unification such as that of all possible metrics (on isospaces with trivial nonlinear isoconnection structure) of a given\ndimension into Santilli’s isoeuclidean metric, the unification of exterior and\ninterior gravitational problems despite their sizable structural differences\nand other unification The view adopted in this work is that a general field theory should incorporate all possible anisotropic, inhomogeneous and stochastic manifestations of classical and quantum interactions and, in consequence, corresponding modifications of basic principles and mathematical methods have to be\nintroduced in order to formulate physical theories There are established\nthree approaches for modeling field interactions and spaces anisotropies The first one is to deal with a usual locally isotropic physical theory and to\nconsider anisotropies as a consequence of the anisotropic structure of sources\nin field equations (for instance, a number of cosmological models are proposed in the framework of the Einstein theory with the energy–momentum\ngenerated by anisotropic matter, as a general reference see [16]) The second\napproach to anisotropies originates from the Finsler geometry [9, 8, 18, 13]\nand its generalizations [3, 14, 2, 5, 28, 27] with a general imbedding into\nKaluza–Klein (super) gravity and string theories [29, 30, 31], and speculates\na generic anisotropy of the space–time structure and of fundamental field\nof interactions The Santilli’s approach is more radical by proposing a generalization of Lie theory and introducing isofields, isodualities and related\nmathematical structures Roughly speaking, by using corresponding partitions of the unit we can model possible metric anisotropies as in Finsler or\ngeneralized Lagrange geometry but the problem is also to take into account\nclasses of anisotropies generated by nonlinear and distinguished connections This is a first paper from a series of works devoted to the formulation of the theory of inhomogeneous, locally anisotropic and higher order\n\n\n3\n\n\nanisotropic isofield interactions (here we note that the term ”higher order”\nis used as a general one for higher order tangent bundles [34], or higher order\nextensions of vector superbundles [30, 31], in a number of lines alternative to\njet bundles [25, 24], and only under corresponding constraints one obtains\nthe geometry of higher order Lagrangians [15]) The main purpose of this\npaper is to present a synthesis of the Santilli isotheory and the approach\non modeling locally anisotropic geometries and physical models on bundle\nspaces provided with nonlinear connection and distinguished connection and\nmetric structures [14, 34] The isotopic variants of generalized Lagrange and\nFinsler geometry will be analyzed Basic geometric constructions such as\nnonlinear isoconnections in vector isobundles, the isotopic curvatures and\ntorsions of distinguished isoconnections and theirs structure equations and\ninvariant values will be defined A model of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous gravitational isotheory will be constructed Section 2 is devoted to basic notations and definitions on Santilli and\ncoauthors isotheory We introduce the bundle isospaces in Section 3 where\nsome necessary properties of Lie–Santilli isoalgebras and isogroups and corresponding isotopic extensions of manifolds are applied in order to define\nfiber isospaces and consider their such (being very important for modeling\nof isofield interactions) classes of principal isobundles and vector isobundles The isogeometry of nonlinear isoconnections in vector isobundles is studied\nin Section 4 Isotopic distinguishing of geometric objects, the isocurvatures\nand isotorsions of nonlinear and distinguished isoconnections, the structure\nequations and invariant conditions are defined in Section 5 The next Section 6 is devoted to the isotopic extensions of generalized Lagrange and\nFinsler geometries The isofield equations of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous interactions will be analyzed in Section 7 The outlook and\nconclusions are contained in Section 8 ### 2 Basic Notions on Isotopies\n\n\nIn this section we shall mainly recall some necessary fundamental notions\nand refer to works [23, 10] for details and references on Lie–Santilli isotheory 4\n\n\n#### 2 1 Isotopies of the unit and isospaces\n\nThe isotheory is based on the concept of fundamental isotopy which is\nthe lifting I → I [�] of the n–dimensional unit I = diag (1, 1, , 1) of the Lie’s\ntheory into an n ×

the letter � ρ (x, v, a, ) refers to the\nprojection of the isometric � ρ in the original space We note that an isofield of Class III, explicitly denoted as F [�] III � a, � +, × [�] �\n\nis a union of two disjoint isofields, one of Class I, F [�] I � a, � +, × [�] �, in which\n\n\n6\n\n\nthe isounit is positive definite, and one of Class II, F [�] II � a, � +, × [�] �, in which\nthe isounit is negative–definite The Class II of isofields is usually written\n� d [�]\nas F [�] [d] [ �] a [d], +, × [�] and called isodual fields with isodual unit I [�] [d] = −I < [�] 0,\n\n\n� d\nisodual isonumbers � a [d] = a × I [�] [d] = −a, isodual isoproduct × [�] = ×T � d × =\n−× [�], etc For simplicity, in our further considerations we shall use the\ngeneral terms isofields, isonumbers even for isodual fields, isodual numbers\nand so on if this will not give rise to ambiguities #### 2 2 Isocontinuity and isotopology\n\n\nThe isonorm of an isofield of Class III is defined as\n\n\n�\n↑a↑ = |a| × I [�]\n\n\n�\nwhere |a| is the conventional norm Having defined a function f (x � ) on\nisospace E [�] � x, � δ, [�] R [�] � over isofield R [�] � n, � +, × [�] � one introduces (see details and\nreferences in [10]) the isomodulus\n\n\n� �\n�� f (x) � = ���� f (x) ��� × � I\n\n\nwhere f (x � ) is the conventional modulus ���� ���\n\nOne says that an infinite sequence of isofunctions of Class I f [�] 1, f [�] 2, is\n”strongly isoconvergent” to the isofunction f [�] of the same class if\n\n\n\nlim\nk→∞\n\n\n\n�\nf k − f = � 0 �� �\n\n\n\nThe Cauchy isocondition is expressed as\n\n�\nf m − f n < � ρ = ρ × � I\n�� �\n\n\nwhere δ is real and m and n are greater than a suitably chosen N (ρ) Now the isotopic variants of continuity, limits, series, etc, can be easily\nconstructed in a traditional manner The notion of n–dimensional isomanifold was studied by Tsagas and\nSourlas (we refer the reader for details in [26]) Their constructions are\n\n\n7\n\n\nbased on idea that every isounit of Class III can always be diagonalized\ninto the form\n\n\n�\nI = diag (B 1, B 2, , B n ), B k (x, ) ̸= 0, k = 1, 2, , n �\nIn result of this one defines an isotopology � τ on R n which coincides everywhere with the conventional topology τ on R [n] except at the isounit I [�]\nIn particular, � τ is everywhere local–differential, except at I [�] which can incorporate integral terms The above structure is called the Tsagas–Sourlas\nisotopology or an integro–differential topology Finally, in this subsection,\nwe note that Prof Tsagas and Sourlas used a conventional topology on\nisomanifolds The isotopology was first introduced by Prof",
