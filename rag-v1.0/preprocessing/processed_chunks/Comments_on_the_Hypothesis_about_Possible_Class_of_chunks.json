According to this hypothesis, the apparent Lorentz invariance of classical space-time can\nbe viewed as a symmetry of the equations of motion of observed matter. In this case no\nreference to absolute properties of space and time is required and besides the usual particles\nand fields, whose speed could not exceed the speed of light c, an another kinds of matter\nmay exists, whose particles have limiting speed c 1 >> c. It was argued, that if there is\nno direct interaction between such two (or more) kinds of matter then their coexistence\ndoes not violate the apparent Lorentz invariance of the laws of physics but may provide\nmost of the cosmic dark matter and produce very high energy cosmic rays compatible with\nsome unexplained discoveries (see for example [1] and references therein). This hypothesis\nwas analyzed in [1] on pure heuristic level without consideration of possible mechanisms of\ngravitational interaction between different sorts of matter.\nIn principle, the hypothesis about coexistence of different noninteracting kinds of matter\nmay be associated with some ideas connecting with formalism of quantum gravity. Namely,\nthe space-time in classical gravity has metric with Lorentzian signature while the formalism\nof continual integration of quantum gravity uses metric with Euclidean signature. The\nconnection between Euclidean and Lorentzian metric is realized by Wick rotation. There\nare different points of view on this procedure, beginning from the consideration of Wick\nrotation as a pure formal method until Hawking’s assumption about Euclidean nature of\nspace-time [2]. If this assumption is valid, then it is naturally to suppose, that among the\nknowing kinds of matter with apparent Lorentzian structure of space-time the other sorts of\nmatter with their own Lorentzian structures may exist.\nIn another context the assumption about possible coexistence of different sorts of matter\non the same manifold was formulated in [3] where the geometrical model for four noninteracting classes of matter with different Lorentzian structures was given. It was pointed\nout lately, that the existence of matter with nonstandard Lorentzian structure may give\ncontribution into the energy-momentum tensor [4], but the corresponding models were not\nanalyzed in details.\nIn this note the geometric ideas of papers [3, 4] are used to analyze the hypothesis [1].\nTo this end in the next section the general geometrical background for different Lorentziann\nstructures which correspond to different sorts of matter on the same Riemannian manifold\nwill be formulated. The resulting energy-momentum tensor is considered in the section 3 for\ntwo particular models when the light cone of the usual matter are in the interior of the ”light\ncone” of the ”superluminal” matter and when the ”light cones” of usual and ”superluminal”\nmatter have empty intersection. Section 4 contains some concluding remarks and discussion.\n\n\n2\n\n\n## 2 The multiple Lorentziann structures on the Rieman- nian manifold\n\nIt is clear, that in the most general form the hypothesis about coexistence of two or more\ndifferent Lorentzian structures on the same manifold, which correspond to the different\nclasses of matter, leads to some kind of bi- or multi-metric gravitation theory. To provide the\ngravitational interaction between particles and fields corresponding to different Lorentziann\nstructures, the metrics, which define these structures, must be connected with each other.\nIn this paper the particular form of such connection is used.\nOur approach is based on the well known correspondence between Riemannian structure\nof manifold, the field of line elements on it and the Lorentziann structures on the same\nmanifolds. Namely, let G αβ is a Riemannian metric on manifold, u α is a unit vector field\n(G [αβ] u α u β = 1) representing the field of line elements and c = const > 0 is a light speed,\nthen\ng αβ = (c [2] + 1)u α u β − G αβ (1)\n\n\nis Lorentziann metric on the same manifold. To apply the above equation to the analysis of\nthe correspondence between several Lorentziann structures on the same Riemannian manifold, let’s suppose that space-time has Riemannian metric G αβ with signature (+, +, +, +)\nand the apparent Lorentzian structure, which is associated with observed matter, is defined\nby equation (1) with the light speed c = 1 (in geometrical units). Vector field u α in (1) may\nbe considered as generator of cosmological reference frame. According to the hypothesis [1]\nlet’s suppose also that among the usual Lorentziann structure there is additional Lorentziann\nstructure on the same manifold, which correspond to nonobservable (dark) matter and is\ndefined by unit vector field v β ̸= u α and the ”light speed” c 1 - 1.\nBy such a way we obtain a bimetric-type model, whose metrics g αβ and q αβ, corresponding\nto the observed and hypothetical dark matter, are defined by\n\n\ng αβ = 2u α u β − G αβ (2)\n\n\nand\nq αβ = (c [2] 1 [+ 1)][v] [α] [v] [β] [ −] [G] [αβ] (3)\n\n\nFollowing to [1], the particles which moves in Lorentziann metric q αβ will be called ”superluminal” or ”dark matter”.\nIt is easy to see that the connection between the determinants of the metrics G αβ, g αβ\nand q αβ are given by (see also ):\nG = −g = −q/c [2] 1 (4)\n\n\nThe correspondence between metrics (2) and (3) are defined by [1]\n\n\nq αβ = g αβ − 2u α u β + (c [2] 1 [+ 1)][v] [α] [v] [β] (5)\n\n\nFor the following it is necessary to define also the correspondence between the inverse\nmetrics g [αβ] and q [αβ] . It is clear that\n\n\ng [αβ] = 2u [α] u [β] − G [αβ] (6)\n\n\n1 An analogous equations were used also in [5] to generate exact solutions of vacuum Einstein equations.\n\n\n3\n\n\nand\n\nq [αβ] = [1 +][ c] 1 [2] v G [α] [v] G [β] [−] [G] [αβ] (7)\nc [2] 1\n\n\nwhere u [α] = G [αβ] u β = g [αβ] u β, v G [α] [=][ G] [αβ] [v] [β] [. Using (6) equation (7) may be rewritten as]\n\n\nq [αβ] = g [αβ] − 2u [α] u [β] + [1 +][ c] 1 [2] k [αβ] (8)\nc [2] 1\n\n\nwhere\nk [αβ] = 4u [α] u [β] (u [ρ] v ρ ) [2] − 2(u [α] v [β] + v [α] u [β] )u [ρ] v ρ + v [α] v [β] (9)\n\n\nwith v [α] = g [αβ] v β .\nUsing the well known equations of the bimetric formalism it is easy to obtain expressions\nwhich connect the covariant derivatives with respect to metrics G αβ, g αβ and q αβ .\nEquations (2)-(9) make possible to analyze the gravitational interaction between of the\nusual (observable) matter and nonobservable (dark) matter.\n\n## 3 Energy-momentum tensor of dark matter in the sim- plest model\n\n\nFor simplicity in this section we consider two massive scalar fields ϕ and ψ, one of which\n(ϕ) corresponds to the usual (observed) matter with metric (2) and the other field (ψ)\ncorresponds to nonobserved (dark) matter whose own Lorentziann structure are defined by\nmetric (3). Simplest action functional for such model may be written in the form\n\n\nS = (R g + L ϕ + c 1 L ψ ) [√] −gd [4] x (10)\n�\n\n\nwhere R g is the Ricci scalar of the metric (2), L ϕ and L ψ are the Lagrangians of the fields\nϕ and ψ correspondingly:\n\n\n\nL ϕ = [1]\n\n\n\nϕ [ϕ] [2] (11)\n2 [m] [2]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\n2 [g] [αβ] [ϕ,] [α] [ ϕ,] [β] [ +1] 2\n\n\n\nand\nL ψ = [1]\n\n\n\nψ [ψ] [2] (12)\n2 [m] [2]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\n2 [q] [αβ] [ψ,] [α] [ ψ,] [β] [ +1] 2\n\n\n\nwhere m ϕ and m ψ are the masses of the corresponding fields and the coefficient c 1 in (10)\nis present because of (4). The geometrical units with c = κ = 1, where κ is Einsteinian\ngravitational constant, is used here. The absence of mixed ϕψ terms in (10) provide the\nLorentz invariance of the motion equations of the usual matter (ϕ) and nonobservability of\nthe hypothetical matter (ψ).\nSubstitution of (8) into (12) gives\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1 k [αβ] )ψ, α ψ, β + [1]\n\n2 [(][g] [αβ] [ −] [2][u] [α] [u] [β] [ + 1 +] c [2] 1 [ c] [2] 2\n\n\n\nL ψ = [1]\n\n\n\nψ [ψ] [2] (13)\n2 [m] [2]\n\n\n\nwhere u [α] = g [αβ] u β and k [αβ] is defined by (9).\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nIt is clear that variation of (10) with respect to ϕ and ψ gives the usual Klein-Gordon\nequations for these fields\n\n\n\nϕ − m [2] ϕ [ϕ][ = 0] (14)\n�\n\n\nψ − m [2] ψ [ψ][ = 0] (15)\n�\n\n\n\n1 ∂\n\n√−g ∂x [α]\n\n\nand\n1 ∂\n\n√−q ∂x [α]\n\n\n\nαβ ∂\n√−gg\n\n∂x [β]\n\n�\n\n\nαβ ∂\n√−qq\n\n∂x [β]\n\n�\n\n\n\nwhile variation of (10) with respect to g [αβ] gives\n\n\nG αβ = T αβ + c 1 T [�] αβ (16)\n\n\nHere G αβ is Einstein tensor corresponding to the metric g αβ, T αβ is the energy-momentum\ntensor of classical matter (field ϕ) and the additional term T [�] αβ is the energy-momentum\ntensor of the field ψ which may be associated with hypothetical ”dark” matter moving in\nmetric q αβ . So, the presence of the additional kind of matter with its own Lorentziann\nstructure does not change the local Lorentz invariance of the field (and motion) equations\nfor the usual matter but give additional term in the right-hand side of Einstein equation. In\ngeneral case this term has the form\n\n\n\n1 [+ 1]\n2 [c] [2]\n\nc [2] 1\n\n\n\n−T [�] αβ = [1]\n\n2 [{][ψ,] [α] [ ψ,] [β] [ −][2 (][u] [α] [ψ,] [β] [ +][u] [β] [ψ] [α] [)][ u] [ρ] [ψ,] [ρ] [ }][ +]\n\n\n� (u α ψ, β +u β ψ α ) u [ρ] ψ, ρ (u [ρ] v ρ ) [2] + (u [ρ] ψ, ρ ) [2] u [ρ] v ρ (u α v β + u β v α ) � −\n\n\n\nc [2] 1 [+ 1]\n\n[(u α ψ, β +u β ψ α ) v [ρ] ψ, ρ u [σ] v σ + (v α ψ, β +v β ψ α ) u [ρ] ψ, ρ u [σ] v σ ] −\nc [2] 1\n\n\n\nc [2] 1 [+ 1]\n\n[u [ρ] ψ, ρ v [σ] ψ, σ (u α v β + u β v α ) − (v α ψ, β +v β ψ, α ) v [σ] ψ, σ ] −\nc [2] 1\n\n\n\n1\n4 [g] [αβ] � q [αβ] ψ, α ψ, α +m [2] ψ [ψ] [2] [�] (17)\n\n\nThe above expression is rather complicated. By this reason it will be considered in two\nparticular cases when the light cons of the usual and ”superluminal” matter are collinear (\nu α = v α with c 1 >> 1) and orthogonal u α ⊥ v α (c 1 = 1) to each other.\n1.

In the simplest case when hypothetical kinds of matter are represented by massive\nscalar fields these additional terms will have the form (22).\n\n## 4 Concluding remarks\n\n\nIn the modern classical general relativity metric of space-time depends on the matter distribution. However the signature of the metric, which defines the local Lorentziann structure of\nspace-time, is supposed to be fixed. It may be supposed that the local Lorentziann structure\nof space-time is also defined by the features of matter. If such supposition is true then the\n\n\n6\n\n\nquestion about uniqueness of such structure is naturally appears. This question may be\nreformulated also as the question about possible coexistence on the same manifold several\ndifferent classes of matter which generate different non-equivalent Lorentziann structures.\nAs it was argued in [1], the coexisting of such different classes of matter without direct\ninteraction between them does not contradict to the apparent Lorentz invariance of the laws\nof physics. On the other hand it may provide most of the cosmic dark matter and produce\nvery high energy cosmic rays compatible with some unexplained discoveries (see for example\n\n[1] and references therein).\nIt is shown that such different classes of matter, which is mentioned in[1], may be naturally described using the well known correspondence (1) between Riemannian structure of\nmanifold (Riemannian metric G αβ ), the field of line elements on it (represented by the unit\nvector field u α ) and the Lorentziann structures (Loretzian metric g αβ ) on the same manifold.\nUsing this correspondence, two Lorentzian structures g αβ and q αβ on the same manifold\n(M [4], G) may be connected by equation (5), which may be used for description of the gravitational interaction between the usual matter, which moves in metric g αβ, and hypothetical\nmatter moving in metric q αβ . Using the simplest model it was shown that the presence\nof the additional kind of matter with its own Lorentziann structure does not change the\nlocal Lorentz invariance of the field (and motion) equations for the usual matter but gives\nadditional term in the right-hand side of Einstein equation. This additional term may be\nconsidered as the energy-momentum tensor of dark matter.\nIn the case then hypothetical dark matter is represented by massive scalar field ψ its\nenergy-momentum tensor is given be equation (19) for colinear light cones or (22) for orthogonal light cones. The corresponding local energy density in cosmological reference frame\nconnected with vector field u α is given by equations (20) and (23) respectively. In both cases\nthe local energy density is positive, so both models may describe cosmological dark matter.\nIt is clear, that in the case of colinear light cones the homogeneous isotropic cosmological solutions for metric g αβ may be easily constructed as well as in the standard general relativity\nwhile in the case of orthogonal light cones metric g αβ may be spatially homogeneous in this\ncase only if the metrics q αβ [i] [are static. On the other hand, there are no obvious problems]\nwith construction of the models of the compact objects for the usual matter with the metric\ng αβ in the case with orthogonal light cones, while the case of colinear light cones may lead\nto the apparent violation of the equivalence principle because any concentration of the usual\n(observable) matter is an attractor for dark matter and vice versa.\nThe action (10), which where considered in the previous section, is non-symmetric with\nrespect to metrics g αβ and q αβ : action (10) may be varied with respect to metric g αβ or with\nrespect to metric q αβ but not both. Moreover, the fields u [α] and v [α] remain undefined and\ntheir nature is unclear. The introduction of these fields in Lagrangian as usual massive or\nmassless vector fields leads to some variant of vector-tensor gravitation theory with preferable reference frame, whereas it is known that the existence of such frames contradicts to\nobservations [6].\nThus, the hypothesis [1] that the cosmological dark matter is generated by the hypothetical particles which able to travel faster then light has rather simple geometrical realization,\nbut its consistency with observations is problematic.\n\n\n7\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Russian Ministry of Science and the Russian Fund of Basic\nSciences (grant N 95-02-05785-a).\n\n## References\n\n\n[1] L.
