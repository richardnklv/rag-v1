    "The new concepts are decoherence matrices and new\noptical filters In Sec In Sec II, we construct the two-by-two Jones-matrix formalism and the Stokes parameters starting from a polarized light wave Section III summarizes our earlier papers on\nthe Jones-matrix formalism as a representation of the Lorentz group In Sec IV, we show\nthat the Stokes parameters are transformed as a Minkowskian four-vector through coherence\npreserving filters In Sec V, we show how a Minkowskian four-vector is constructed from two spinors It\nis noted that there are two different sets of spinors for the case of the Lorentz group, and\nthis distinction is responsible for the difference between electrons and positrons It is shown\nhow the light wave and its complex conjugate correspond to the electron and positron\nrespectively In Sec In Sec VI, we compare the Jones vectors and the Stokes parameters, and\nexplain why the four-vector representation of the Stokes parameters contain more physics\n\n\n2\n\n\nthan the Jones-matrix formalism It is noted in Sec VII that the Stokes four-vector can\n\naccommodate polarized waves with partial coherence We present in this section a matrix\nformulation of decoherence effects, and derive a measurable consequence We present in this section a matrix\nformulation of decoherence effects, and derive a measurable consequence In Sec VIII we discuss physical implications of the procedure outlined in this paper,\nusing a concrete physical example In Appendix A, the Lorentz group is discussed in terms\nof Lorentz transformations applicable to the four-dimensional Minkowskian space The twodimensional Euclidean group is used in our discussion of possible new optical filters We\nexplain this group in terms of translations and rotations on a flat plane in Appendix B II FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM\n\n\n\nIn studying polarized light propagating along the z direction, the traditional approach is\nto consider the x and y components of the electric fields Their amplitude ratio and the phase\ndifference determine the degree of polarization Thus, we can change the polarization either\nby adjusting the amplitudes, by changing the relative phases, or both For convenience,\nwe call the optical device which changes amplitudes an “attenuator” and the device which\nchanges the relative phase a “phase shifter ”\nLet us write these electric fields as\n\nE x = A exp {i(kz − ωt + φ 1 )} (2 1)\n\n� E y � � B exp {i(kz − ωt + φ 2 )} �\n\n\n\n= A exp {i(kz − ωt + φ 1 )}\n� � B exp {i(kz − ωt + φ 2 )} (2 1)\n�\n\n\n\nwhere A and B are the amplitudes which are real and positive numbers, and φ 1 and φ 2 are\nthe phases of the x and y components respectively This column matrix is called the Jones\nvector The content of polarization is determined by the ratio:\n\n\n\nE B\ny =\nE x � A\n\n\n\ne [i][(][φ] [2] [−][φ] [1] [)]",

    "This can be measured by the attenuation of the y component which is not affected by the\nsymmetry operation of Eq (8 8) Is it possible to produce optical filters of this kind Starting from an optically active\nmaterial, we can introduce an asymmetry in absorption to it by either mechanical or electrical\nmeans Another approach would be to pile up alternately the J 3 -type and K 2 -type layers In either case, it is interesting to note that the combination of these two effects produces a\nspecial effect predicted from the Lorentz group The group E(2), although new in optics, has many interesting properties having to do\nwith our daily life One important property is the conversion of multiplication into addition\nas the following matrix algebra indicates:\n\n\n\n1 v 1\n� 0 1\n\n\n\n1 v 2\n�� 0 1\n\n\n\n1 v 1 + v 2\n=\n� � 0 1\n\n\n18 (8 9)\n�\n\n\nSince this group deals with rotations and translations on a plane, it has a great potential in\nnavigational sciences However, we are here interested in what role this group plays in the\nStokes parameters In the Jones-matrix formalism, we used two-by-two matrices for transformations For the\nStokes parameters, we have to use four-by-four matrices applicable to Stokes four-vectors The four-by-four generators of the Lorentz transformations are given in Sec IV They are\ndiscussed in more detail in Appendix A There, the generators N 1 and N 2 are derived from\nthe boost and rotation generators From these generators, we can construct transformation\nmatrices:\n\n\nT 1 (u) = exp (−iuN 1 )\n\n\n\n1 + u [2] /2 0 u −u [2] /2\n0 1 0 0\n\nu 0 1 −u\nu [2] /2 0 u 1 − u [2] /2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [,]\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT 2 (v) = exp (−ivN 2 )\n\n\n\n1 + v [2] /2 −v 0 −v [2] /2\n−v 1 0 v\n\n0 0 1 0\nv [2] /2 −v 0 1 − v [2] /2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (8 10)\n\n [ ]\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese expressions are the four-by-four representation of the transformation matrices given\nin Eq (8 7) for the Jones spinors Unlike the Jones-matrix formalism, the Stokes parameters can describe partially coherent\nlight waves This is the reason why the above four-by-four expression is complicated These\ntransformation matrices preserve coherence If decoherence is introduced, we can apply the\ndecoherence matrices discussed in Sec VII",
    "VII It is interesting to note that the Lorentz-group\nformulation of polarization optics opens up this kind of new possibilities in physics CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\n\nIn this paper, we have shown that both the Jones-matrix formalism and the Stokes parameters can be formulated as two different representations of the same Lorentz group The\nphysics of the Stokes parameters can deal with the coherence between the two polarization\ndirections It is shown also that the decoherence effect can also be formulated within the\nframework of the Lorentz group or in terms of the mathematics of squeezed states of light There have been in the past many laudable attempts to construct a mathematical representation for polarization optics based on the Lorentz group [17,22,23] However, the\nLorentz group, particularly its relevance to optics, was not fully appreciated until it started\nplaying the role of the underlying symmetry group for squeezed states of light [7,24–26] This naturally led to a new interest in possible applications of the Lorentz group in other\nbranches of optics including polarization optics [9,10,23] From the group theoretical point of view, what is new in this paper is that we used\nin Sec V an additional symmetry of the Lorentz group to understand fully the connection\nbetween the Jones matrix and the Stokes parameters This additional symmetry was the\n\n\n19\n\n\none which connects electrons with positrons through charge conjugation This opens a new\nresearch line which will connect symmetries of relativistic particles with polarization optics We can attempt to understand the symmetries of particle physics not from commutation\nrelations of group generators but from what we observe in optics laboratories It is true that we used group theory as the main carrier of our analysis On the other\nhand, it is true also that we did not start our paper with commutation relations, but with\nwhat we observe in the real world We concluded this paper with what we can observe or\nwe may possibly observe in the real world APPENDIX A: SUBGROUPS OF THE LORENTZ GROUP\n\n\n\nLet us consider the space-time coordinates (t, x, y, z), analogous to the
