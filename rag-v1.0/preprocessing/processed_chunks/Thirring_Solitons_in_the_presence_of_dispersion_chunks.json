    "Homoclinic solutions were also\nsought for D < 0 and |ω| < 1, but no evidence of primary or multi-humped ones was found Looking at Fig 2, there remains the crucial question whether there are any more primary\nbranches to the left of that labeled 3 A seemingly plausible conjecture is that there is a\nself-similar structure of primary branches as one moves to the left in Fig 2, i e , infinitely\nmany branches accumulating on the TS segment {D = 0, |ω| < 1}, the branches 1,2 and 3\nbeing but the first three in the structure (note that, at least for D < 2, there cannot be any\nfurther primary solutions to the right of branch 1, because here the two-soliton curves 9–12\nform a barrier for them) However, careful numerical scanning of the parametric plane of\nFig 2 to the left of branch 3 has strongly indicated that the above hypothesis is false, in\nregion III there being no primary branches other than 1, 2, and 3 For ω sufficiently close\nto −1, this assertion is substantiated as follows\nFig 4 reports the results of a thorough numerical investigation of other possible solution\nbranches at ω = −0 99, varying D between 0 and [1] [ We find that, to the left of branch]\n\n\n\nbranches at ω = −0 99, varying D between 0 and 2 [1] [ We find that, to the left of branch]\n\n3, an infinite sequence of multi-soliton BS’s occurs Even though, because of numerical\nproblems in the singular limit, we have only computed the corresponding two-solitons down\nto D ≈ 0",
    "Even though, because of numerical\nproblems in the singular limit, we have only computed the corresponding two-solitons down\nto D ≈ 0 2, Fig 4 clearly suggests accumulation of the sequence as D → 0 The energy of\nthe two-solitons remains finite, while the separation between the two bound pulses diverges\n∼ 1/D as D → 0 (which explains the existence of TS in the limit D = 0) Thus, what does\naccumulate on the TS manifold at D → 0 is an infinite sequence of multi-soliton branches,\nwith no fundamental-soliton branch closer to the TS manifold than the branch 3 in Fig 2 To support this numerical finding with qualitative arguments, consider what happens\nto the primary branches as they cross the line ω = −1 from above For D > [1] [this is a]\n\n\n\nto the primary branches as they cross the line ω = −1 from above For D > 2 [this is a]\n\n“harmless” transition, because the real eigenvalues of the linearized equations, that govern\nthe decay of the homoclinic solution at |x| →∞, behave smoothly and they are bounded\naway from zero A well-defined primary branch safely crosses ω = −1 in this case, which\nfor ω < −1 describes a curve of “orbit-flip” bifurcations (cf [16]) However, for D < [1] [, the]\n\n\n\nfor ω < −1 describes a curve of “orbit-flip” bifurcations (cf [16]) However, for D < 2 [, the]\n\ncorresponding eigenvalues vanish as ω →−1, hence no smooth transition can take place Thus, there may be no primary-soliton branches at 0 < 1 + ω ≪ 1, D < [1] [ ]\n\n\n\n2 [ ]\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 0 5\n\n\n|2-pulses<br>2<br>1 5 1 5<br>1 1<br>0 5 0 5<br>0 0<br>0 5 -0 5<br>-1 -1<br>0 20 60 100 140 180 0 10 20<br>1 5<br>1<br>0 5<br>0<br>-0 5<br>-1<br>0 20 40 60 80100 120|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|2-pulses<br>-1<br>-0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>2<br>0 10 20<br>-1<br>0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>0 20<br>60 100 140 180<br>-1<br>-0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>0 20 40 60 80100 120||Re U<br>Im U|\n|2-pulses<br>-1<br>-0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>2<br>0 10 20<br>-1<br>0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>0 20<br>60 100 140 180<br>-1<br>-0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>0 20 40 60 80100 120|||\n|2-pulses<br>-1<br>-0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>2<br>0 10 20<br>-1<br>0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>0 20<br>60 100 140 180<br>-1<br>-0 5<br>0<br>0 5<br>1<br>1 5<br>0 20 40 60 80100 120||0 40 50 6<br>x|\n\n\n\nD\n\nFIG 4 A sequence of two-soliton solutions at D → 0 for ω = −0 99",
