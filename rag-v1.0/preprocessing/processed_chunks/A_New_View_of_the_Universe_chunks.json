    ") So I'd like to\nbegin by asserting that, when we speak of \"nonlinear waves, # we are really talking about\nwaves in general **Fig 1-1 ** Shock front development in an acoustic wave (From Towne (From Towne ) 5\n\n\nA basic attribute of nonlinear waves, essential to the present theory, is feedback A simple\nexample can be seen in acoustic shock waves In these, the propagation velocity depends\nmarkedly on wave amplitude -- the larger the amplitude, the greater the velocity In these, the propagation velocity depends\nmarkedly on wave amplitude -- the larger the amplitude, the greater the velocity Fig 1-1\ndepicts the development of a shock front (Here the wave is propagating in just one\ndimension ) As the faster-moving peak overtakes the front of the wave, the more it grows And the more it grows, the faster it overtakes the front, steepening the wavefront So here\nthere is positive feedback Ripples in wind-blown sand are a good example of negative feedback This gives the ripples\nin a given region similar heights and spacings (One obvious factor is that the wind blows\nthe exposed tops off of taller ripples ) Sand ripples also have a capacity to counteract\ndisturbances If you rub out some of the ripples in an area, with a steady wind, the pattern\nwill \"heal\" itself Feedback is, of course, an essential element in many self-organizing natural\nsystems, the most remarkable being life While sand ripples exhibit only simple behaviors,\nthere are other wave systems which may seem almost alive Such waves are found in the plasmas of fusion machines These highly nonlinear waves, or\n\"instabilities, # have a remarkably powerful and adaptable capacity for self-organization The\nplasmas are contained in magnetic \"wells\" with energy depths far greater than the overall\nplasma energies However, the instabilities have high localized energy concentrations,\nwhich have invariably allowed them and their plasmas to escape the best designed wells 4\n\n\nLike insects evolving to defeat pesticides, as wells have been redesigned to defeat known\ninstabilities, new types have always arisen to take their places What causes nonlinearity in waves The obvious answer is: nonlinearity in the wave media However, even with a perfectly linear medium (if there were such) nonlinearity can still\narise Nonlinearity in waves has a second cause, equally as important as the characteristics\nof the medium: the waves themselves This aspect of wave behavior receives little attention\nin most university physics curricula In elementary texts, the mechanism behind this\nnonlinearity is usually denied:\n\n\nIf you have ever watched ocean waves moving toward shore, you may have\nwondered if the waves were carrying water into the beach This is, in fact,\nnot the case",
    "This is, in fact,\nnot the case Water waves move with a recognizable velocity But each\nparticle of water itself merely oscillates about an equilibrium point This\nis a general feature of waves: waves can move over large distances, but the\nmedium itself has only limited movement A wave consists of oscillations\nthat move without carrying matter with them -Douglas C Giancoli\n_Physics_, 3rd Ed , 1991\n\n\n_Waves transport energy, but not matter, from one region to another_ [Original\nitalics ]\n-Hugh D Young\n_University Physics_, 8th Ed , 1992 , 1992 here we see an essential feature of what is called wave motion A condition\n\nof some kind is transmitted from one place to another by means of a medium,\nbut the medium itself is not transported -A P French\n\n_Vibrations and Waves,_\n_M I T Introductory Physics Series_\n\n\n(The first two texts are used at my university ) By the time they reach graduate school, most\ncontinuing physics students probably learn that this picture of waves is wrong However,\nalthough it becomes apparent in more advanced texts, the error of this wave picture is\nseldom pointed out explicitly * Real waves _can_ transport their media And waves which do\n\n\n*It’s been argued that there's nothing wrong with this teaching method An example cited\nis the teaching of mechanics, which begins with the inaccurate Newtonian system,\nsuperseded later by relativity There is a difference, though When relativity is introduced,\nit’s pointed out, repeatedly, that the Newtonian picture is incorrect 5\n\n\nare inherently nonlinear, regardless of the medium they occur in As we'll see, such waves\nare actually commonplace in the real world and play a central role in the present theory We'll call waves which move their media from place to place \"flow waves # Water solitons\nare a clear example The amplitude of an individual \"shallow water\" soliton propagating in\nthe x direction is given approximately by\n\n\n\n_`u`_ � `3` � _`sech`_ `[2]`\n```\n        2\n\n```\n\n\n(1-1)\n\n\n\nwhere u is the water surface elevation in relation to the undisturbed surface, � is the soliton's\nvelocity, and t is time This equation indicates that water solitons can hold their shape over 6\n\ntime For a given t, it describes a symmetrical, raised hump of water, declining to the same\nlevel on both sides of the peak, as illustrated in Fig 1-2",
    "1-2 At the time depicted, most of this\nsoliton is in region A Compared to an adjacent region, B, of equal length, A holds more\nwater It's apparent that, as the soliton enters B, a water volume equaling that of the hump\nmust flow from region A into B Outside the soliton, the water is motionless So, as the\nsoliton proceeds further, this displaced water never flows back So, as the\nsoliton proceeds further, this displaced water never flows back **Fig 1-2 ** Water soliton Naturally occurring solitons can be seen in the ocean photo of Fig Naturally occurring solitons can be seen in the ocean photo of Fig 1-5 Unlike the isolated\nsoliton just described, this regular array carries an intermittent, but continuing flow of water While these apparently were created by a storm, ocean solitons can also be caused by tides Oceanographers refer to the overall movement of water brought about by waves as \"mass\ntransport \" [7]\n\n\nSolitons are by no means the only flow waves occurring in water Ordinary \"dispersing\"\nwaves can move water from place to place also In fact, this is generally the case for the\nwaves created by wind Contrary to the first text cited, ordinary ocean waves _do_ bring water\nto the shore With large waves, the effects can be dramatic: for example, waves are\nresponsible, to a significant degree, for bringing the high tides associated with storms Rip currents are another effect of ocean flow waves What happens is this: as waves bring\nwater to the beach and then dissipate, the water level there is raised The raised level then\ndrives a return flow back out to sea When the incoming waves are small, the return flow\n\n\n6\n\n\nusually takes the form of an undertow However, when the waves are larger, the water\ndraining from the beach often becomes organized into rip currents [7]\n\n\nThere are many other examples of natural flow waves besides those created by tides or\nwinds What happens when you toss a rock into a pond Of course the rock displaces water;\nmost of that displacement is borne off by waves On a larger scale, tsunamis are flow waves\ngenerated by the vertical displacement of the sea floor When you speak or sing, the sound\nwaves carry away a flow of air Flow waves also arise in solids For example, seismic waves\npropagate lasting displacements in the earth's crust While they've received scarce attention,\nwaves that transport their media are more the rule in nature than the exception Where the present theory is concerned, an important feature of flow waves is that, even in\na \"linear\" medium, they do not superpose like linear waves When interacting, in addition\nto displacing each other, flow waves can also refract and reflect one another We'll be\nlooking at these phenomena later Except for computer simulation, it is difficult to describe\nthe interactions of flow waves accurately in more than one dimension However, we'll infer\nsome of their gross behaviors from the interactions of steady flows and waves (Here we'll\nbe working with acoustic waves For water waves, an excellent reference on wave/flow\ninteractions is a review by Peregrine ) 7\n\n\nIn addition to its presence in many nonlinear wave phenomena, flow is also found at the\nheart of a great many chaotic systems Some well-known examples are Edward Lorenz's air\nconvection model, or the Lorenzian waterwheel (also known as the \"turbulent fountain\"),\ndripping water faucets, Taylor vortices, meandering rivers, the Brusselator (a chemical\nreactor with flowing reactants), piling streams of sand, stirred paint, and Jupiter's Great Red\nSpot #### Wraparound Trapping\n\n\nIn 1965, Zabusky and Kruskal published a ground-breaking report on computer simulations 8\n\nof waves in a nonlinear medium Their paper marked the first use of the word \"soliton # The wave system studied was a very simple, one-dimensional one, governed by the\n\n\n*Although Zabusky and Kruskal were unaware when they introduced the term, solitons\nwere discovered in 1834 by the Scottish scientist and engineer John Scott-Russell ScottRussell first observed solitons while studying the waves made by canal barges and later\nreproduced them in extensive wave tank experiments Emphasizing the transport, or flow,\nof the wave medium, his term for the phenomenon was \"wave of translation\" (Borrowing\nfrom Russell, maybe a better term for flow waves would be \"translation waves\" )\n\n\n7\n\n\nKorteweg-de Vries, or KdV equation:\n\n\n\n\n[0] `[3]` _`[u]`_\n\n[0] _`[u]`_\n\n0 _`x`_ [�)] `[2]`\n\n\n\n0 _`u`_ [0] _`[u]`_\n0 _`t`_ [�] _`[u]`_ 0 _`x`_\n\n\n\n\n[�] `[0]`\n0 _`x`_ `[3]`\n\n\n\n(1-2)\n\n\n\nThis describes the behavior of waves in a dispersive medium, where wave velocity varies\nboth with wavelength and amplitude The equation pertains (although not precisely) to\ncertain waves in water, plasmas and a variety of other media (Eq (1-1) for the amplitude\nof a water soliton is obtained as a solution of this one",

    "Referring to Fig 1-3, if space is divided into regions equal\nto the period of the initial waveform, you can see that the waves in each region are effectively\ntrapped there Because of the repetitive nature of the system, every time a wave or wave\ncomponent exits the right side of a region, an identical wave enters from the left, and vice\nversa It's as though each region wraps around on itself So, the periodicity of such systems\nis conserved So, the periodicity of such systems\nis conserved 9\n\n\n**Fig 1-5 ** Water solitons, in a U S Army photo from a 1933 _National Geographic_ The original caption read, \"As\nthey near the coast of Panama, huge, deep-sea waves, relics of a recent storm, are transformed into waves that\nhave crests, but little or no troughs A light breeze is blowing diagonally across the larger waves to produce a\ncross-chop \"\n\n\n**Fig 1-6 1-6 ** Waves in an artificial wave tank, showing self-organized structure in the horizontal transverse\ndirection At the end of the tank where these waves were generated, the wavefronts are straight and smooth At the end of the tank where these waves were generated, the wavefronts are straight and smooth [12]\n\nPhoto by M -Y - Su - Su 10\n\n\n#### Coherent Structures\n\nThere isn't a standard definition for the term \"coherent structure # Most often, it is used in\nconnection with the study of turbulence, where it generally refers to an underlying spatial\nregularity in the vorticity of turbulent systems However, it has also been used by nonlinear\nwave researchers, as a catchall term for any sort of organized nonlinear wave system In this\npaper, we'll use a definition which straddles these areas Here, we define a coherent\nstructure as: a self-organized, regular arrangement of waves and/or vorticity (We don't\nrequire strict periodicity For example, quasicrystalline wave structures exhibit regularity\nwithout being periodic ) 11\n\n\nA good example of a wave-based coherent structure is the highly regular array of ocean\nsolitons in Fig",
    ") 11\n\n\nA good example of a wave-based coherent structure is the highly regular array of ocean\nsolitons in Fig 1-5 1-5 Rip current patterns are another type of coherent structure Off long,\nstraight beaches, where the ocean bottom is uniform, rip currents are observed to have fairly\nregular spacings Involved are water circulation patterns resembling convection cells An\nintriguing aspect of these systems is that the incoming flow waves appear to be diverted by\nthe outgoing rip currents from those regions 7\n\n\nAnother, very interesting, coherent structure can be seen in Fig 1-6 1-6 The photograph shows\na regular arrangement of cusps which develop in artificial waves created in a wave tank 12\n\nWhile it normally refers to the vertical dimension of water waves, here we'll use the term\n\"transverse\" to indicate the transverse horizontal dimension In the area of the tank where\n\nthese waves are generated, no transverse structure at all is seen; initially the wavefronts are\nstraight and smooth However, as the waves move across the tank, this cusped structure\ndevelops Obviously, without the initial waves, there would be nowhere for cusps to form With respect to the wave components forming the cusps, _the wave medium consists not of water_\n_alone, but of waves as well_ The wind-blown sand ripples mentioned above are a coherent structure involving both\nwaves and vorticity In this phenomenon, vortex rolls in the air, caused by the KelvinHelmholtz effect, shape the wind and sand (The rolls form between a moving wind layer\nand a static boundary air layer at the sand surface ) Concurrently, developing sand ripples\npromote eddies in the airflow which reinforce the rolls and attract them to the ripples If the\nwind doesn't shift, the resulting pattern can be strikingly regular An important aspect of coherent structures is that they are _non-local_ phenomena, reflecting\nthe overall properties of the physical systems where they evolve It's apparent, for example,\nthat the shape and size of wind-blown sand ripples are a product of such factors as the\ngeneral coarseness of the sand, the density of the sand particles, the overall wind speed, etc 11\n\n\n**Fig 1-7 ** Milk drop Photography by Ronald Bucchino [13]\n\n\n12\n\n\nIt’s not always so apparent where the phase of a coherent structure comes from Starting\nwith a large flat area of sand and a steady wind, sand ripples are observed to form The\nquestion arises: how do they decide _where_ to form initially The answer must be that, while\nit may be unobservable, at some finer level, there is always some pre-existing structure with\na predominant spatial phase (There is no such thing as a perfectly flat area of sand or a\nperfectly steady wind ) So the observed large-scale structure and its phase result from the\namplification of a lesser, sometimes unseen, structure A seemingly magical manifestation of this effect can be found in the high-speed photographs\nof a milk drop in Fig",
    "A seemingly magical manifestation of this effect can be found in the high-speed photographs\nof a milk drop in Fig 1-7 In the fourth frame, there are eight clearly defined depressions, 13\n\nhaving a radial symmetry and fairly regular spacings However, in the first frame, only an\ninstant before, absolutely nothing with an eightfold radial symmetry can be seen (You could\nsay there are \"hidden\" variables ) The highly unstable nature of capillary waves (the type\ninvolved here) guarantees that such depressions will form However, it is remarkable how,\nin no apparent time, the system organizes itself and \"decides\" the angle at which the overall\npattern will be oriented This finishes the informal introduction to nonlinear wave phenomena and coherent\nstructures Where the present theory is concerned, some relevant points are these:\n\n\n1 Flow is an essential element of many self-organizing, chaotic nonlinear\nsystems 2 2 Commonly, waves transport their media, i e , cause them to flow 3 3 Flow waves are inherently nonlinear, regardless of the medium in which\nthey are found Flow waves are inherently nonlinear, regardless of the medium in which\nthey are found 4 4 Flow waves can refract and reflect each other Flow waves can refract and reflect each other 5 5 It's not unusual for nonlinear wave systems to organize themselves into\nrepetitive structures It's not unusual for nonlinear wave systems to organize themselves into\nrepetitive structures 6 Repetitive wave structures may exhibit quantum mechanical behaviors Repetitive wave structures may exhibit quantum mechanical behaviors 13\n\n\n## 2",
    "13\n\n\n## 2 A New Wave System\n\nNow I'd like to introduce a new kind of nonlinear wave system However, first I need to\ndescribe the geometric framework in which these waves exist, because it is not the usual\nMinkowski space-time Sometimes divergent mathematical representations can be found for\nthe same phenomena For example, features on the surface of a sphere can be described by\neither a 2-D non-Euclidean geometry or a 3-D Euclidean one Here we'll be using a higherorder Euclidean alternative to the non-Euclidean geometry of Einstein and Minkowski Two of special relativity's founders, H A A Lorentz and Henri Poincaré (who was responsible\nfor the term \"relativity\"), never accepted Einstein's space-time interpretation Both insisted,\nto the end, that relativistic phenomena could be accounted for without completely\nabandoning classical time To make this possible, Lorentz proposed incorporating relativistic\ncontraction into the theory of matter However, it was objected that he did so on an ad hoc\nbasis Lorentz's theory was also perceived to have a second drawback: It involved a \"preferred\"\nframe of reference Einstein made the compelling argument that it makes no sense to\nhypothesize a preferred frame if it can't be identified experimentally We will look at this\nargument again later For now, though, I'd like to go ahead and describe a hypothetical\nphysical system which does involve a preferred reference frame, but in which relativistic (as\nwell as quantum mechanical) phenomena arise naturally, without ad hoc hypotheses #### The Geometric Framework\n\n\nThe framework for this theory is a 4-dimensional Euclidian space and classical time (So if\ntime is counted as a dimension, this system has five ) We'll call the spatial dimensions x, y,\nz and 1 (phi) Within this framework there is a repeating system of waves, redundant along\nthe 1 dimension Initially, we'll assume that the entire wave pattern repeats perfectly along\n1 in a sinusoidal fashion, with a spatial period which we'll call the structure interval or s (In other words, at any given x, y, z location, along 1 we would see a uniform sinusoidal\nvariation in the wave amplitude with a spatial period s )\n\n\nFig 2-1 shows a simple wavefront pattern in the x, 1 plane (In a more realistic case, the\nwaves would form interference patterns, without such distinct fronts ) Dividing space into\nparallel regions of thickness s along the 1 axis, you can see that any wave or wave\ncomponent exiting one side of a region is matched by an identical wave entering from the\nopposite side As in the one-dimensional wave system of Zabusky, Kruskal and Tappert, the\nwaves in each periodic section are effectively trapped there by the wraparound effect, and\nthe periodicity of the overall structure is conserved (So, if you start with a system of\nrepeating waves with period s, and the waves don't dissipate, any wave patterns which\ndevelop will always have this period )\n\n\n14\n\n\nIn describing this 4-D wave system, we'll make frequent use of a 3-D \"reference space\"\ncorresponding to the locus of points where 1 = 0, shown as a horizontal line in Fig 2-1 (This is analogous to a reference plane in 3-D geometry ) Because of its repetitive nature, _the_\n_entire 4-D wave system can be mapped into this 3-D space_ In the case of sinusoidal waves, this\ncan be done simply by specifying the sinusoidal amplitude and phase at each 3-D point\n(x,y,z) For example, the waveform on the right in Fig 2-1 depicts the wave amplitude along\nthe vertical line, A, at point (x,y,z ) The waveform can be mapped to this point in the A A A\nreference space by its overall sinusoidal amplitude, plus a phase value determined by the\nwaveform's positioning along 1 (The symbol 1 was chosen because it often represents\nphase ) Mapping this four-dimensional system into three will let us compare it with the\nthree-dimensional world we experience **Fig 2-1 ** A wavefront pattern and associated amplitude at x, y, z in the reference A A A\nspace Vertical line A represents a \"pro-particle # (While the wavefronts are\nhypersurfaces, A is only a line in four dimensions )\n\n#### The Wave Medium\n\n\nThe wave medium in this theory is an elastic fluid; consequently, its waves are acoustic (i e sound-like) Except for its four-dimensional aspect, in many other respects it resembles an\nordinary fluid, such as air For example, a box of air is inhomogeneous and chaotic at the\nscale of molecules, but relatively uniform at the macroscopic level Similarly, the properties\nof this wave medium will be taken to vary at different scales In its scale-dependant nature,\nthis medium differs from the historical ether, which was generally considered \"ideal # \n\n*In Greek mythology, the ether was something pure in the rarified atmosphere of Mount\nOlympus, breathed by the gods 15\n\n\nThere are several other differences: In theories such as Lorentz's \"Theory of the Electron, #\nthe ether was assumed to be an elastic solid, to accommodate transverse electromagnetic\nwaves Of course it had one less spatial dimension Also, the ether was generally taken to\nbe distinct from $ ponderable matter, # and extemely tenuous, so the latter could pass through\nit unimpeded On the other hand, the wave medium in this theory is substantive Further,\nelementary particles here are wave-based phenomena, where both they and their medium\nare constituted of essentially the same stuff So I'd like to call this four-dimensional fluid\nwave medium simply \"stuff #\n\n\nLike sound in air at a given temperature, the acoustic waves in stuff have a characteristic\nvelocity -- in this case, the speed of light, c Since such waves are essentially longitudinal,\nof course they can't represent light per se, although they travel at more or less the same\nspeed (How can electromagnetic waves be accounted for then As we'll see later, in\nrepetitive nonlinear wave structures, transverse secondary waves can arise These are waves\nof interaction _within_ the waves, or _wave waves_ if you like Already we've partially glimpsed\nsuch behavior in the cusped water waves of Fig",
    "Already we've partially glimpsed\nsuch behavior in the cusped water waves of Fig 1-6 1-6 )\n\n\nIn this \"4-D Wave Theory, # acoustic waves are responsible not only for particles, but also\ntheir fields Before describing how, I need to introduce various basic features of the wave\nsystem However, to introduce this system, it seems that something resembling particles is\nneeded So, initially, I'd like to make use of a very incomplete particle model proposed by\nSchrödinger #### Pro-particles and de Broglie Waves\n\n\nIn the early 1800's W R R Hamilton developed a new formulation of mechanics based on a\nclose analogy between the behavior of material bodies and light His system was based on\nhypothetical \"surfaces of constant action, # analogous to light wavefronts, whose normals\n(rays) described the motions of material bodies Schrödinger was inspired by Hamilton's\noptical-mechanical analogy in his development of wave mechanics, and felt that it might be\nextended to further account for the elementary particles It was Schrödinger's contention that\nparticles might be nothing more than geometric normal rays associated with the continuous\nwavefronts of matter waves In the present theory, elementary particles are not such simple 14\n\nentities However, at this point it will be useful to assume Schrödinger's ray/particle model\nand explore its implications in the context of this wave system (Many features of this\nsimplified particle model will carry over )\n\n\nOne of these Schrödinger \"particles\" can be seen as a point moving with a wave, along a\nnormal to the wavefront, keeping the same phase position on the wave (As though it were\nsomehow possible to mark a point on a wave itself, instead of marking the wave medium )\nThe trajectory or velocity vector of this wave-point corresponds then to a ray",
    ")\nThe trajectory or velocity vector of this wave-point corresponds then to a ray 16\n\n\nIn Fig 16\n\n\nIn Fig 2-1, the bold arrow at x,0 depicts the 4-D velocity vector of a Schrödinger \"particle\" A\nin our new wave system Notice that, from the repetitive nature of this system, we\nnecessarily have identical \"particles\" and vectors at 1 = s, 1 = 2s, etc , shown here as dotted\narrows Also, between these are others, which, although differing in phase, have exactly the\nsame velocity vector Since all these \"particles, # a continuous line of them at a given x, y, z\nposition, move together, we can treat them as a single unit This is depicted by the line, A,\nin the figure, which parallels the 1 axis We'll call these vertical, line-shaped ensembles \"pro-particles, # short for \"provisional\nparticles # (We'll be working with pro-particles until we get to the realistic particle model\nintroduced in a later section ) While it corresponds to a line in four dimensions, a proparticle appears as a single point in our 3-D reference space (having an associated phase\nvalue) Note that a pro-particle's position in the reference space is unchanged by its motion\nin the 1 dimension So, with waves moving parallel to the 1 axis, the observed velocity of\nan associated pro-particle is zero On the other hand, if the waves are moving almost\nperpendicularly to 1, the pro-particle velocity seen in the reference space approaches its 4-D\nvelocity, c On the other hand, if the waves are moving almost\nperpendicularly to 1, the pro-particle velocity seen in the reference space approaches its 4-D\nvelocity, c **Fig 2-2 ** Two sets of hyperplane waves, with different wavelengths, as seen in the\nreference space ( 1 =0) Our wave system allows the four-dimensional equivalent of 3-D plane waves; we'll call these\nhyperplane waves (We can refer to such a geometric entity as a 3-D \"space, # like our\n\"reference space, # or a 4-D hyperplane, when we want to emphasize the analogy to a 3-D\nplane ) Two sets of hyperplane waves are depicted in Fig 2-2 Above are the wavefronts in\nthe x, 1 plane and below are the corresponding wave amplitudes seen in the reference space,\n1 = 0 Although the wavelengths are different, both sets of waves necessarily have the same\n\n\n17\n\n\nspatial period, s, along the 1 dimension Arbitrary waveforms, including the curving\nwavefronts depicted in Fig 2-1, can be constructed from multidimensional Fourier series' of\nsinusoidal hyperplane wave components such as these The relativistic wavelength of the de Broglie waves associated with an actual particle of rest\nmass m is given by 0\n\n\n\n�� _`[h]`_\n\n```\n    m v\n       0\n\n```\n\n\n(2-1)\n\n\n\nwhere v is its velocity, and h is Planck's constant (With no external vector potential ) What\nwavelength is associated with a moving pro-particle Here we'll refer to the two-part\ndiagram of Fig 2-3 On the left side, we have a set of hyperplane wavefronts, moving up and\nto the right The vertical line, A, represents a pro-particle associated with the waves Again,\ns is the 1 interval for the waves, while � is the wavelength seen in the reference space",

    "20\n\n\n## 3 Special Relativity\n\nAlthough the physical system in this theory is properly relativistic, a preferred frame of\nreference is involved So, this section begins with an overview of the preferred frame issue In solving relativity problems, one typically chooses some particular reference frame with\na given state of motion, to which events in other frames are referred Observed from this\n\"rest\" frame, clocks in all others run more slowly, and objects in all other frames are\ncontracted Also, as seen from this chosen frame, the various relativistic phenomena\noccurring in other frames interact such that these effects are not detectable by observers in\nthose frames Lorentz and Einstein came to fundamentally different interpretations as to the physical\nreality behind this situation To preserve the classical role of time in the universe at large,\nLorentz argued that there is some reference frame, corresponding to a state of absolute rest,\nin which time is not dilated Viewed from this preferred frame, events in other frames are\nseen to behave exactly as they do when one arbitrarily chooses a rest frame in solving a\nrelativity problem However, the relativistic effects observed from this frame are considered\nobjectively real As Lorentz repeatedly pointed out, such an approach is equivalent to\nEinstein's space-time interpretation from the standpoints of both mathematics and\nexperiment (At least as far as special relativity is concerned )\n\n\nEinstein argued that since all reference frames are subjectively equivalent (with respect to\nlinear motion), it necessarily complicates things to assume that one is preferred Much of the\nforce of this argument comes from the idea that a preferred frame system requires the ad hoc\nassumption of relativistic transformations However, Einstein's space-time interpretation\n_does_ include a preferred frame for rotational motion (While linear motion is defined by\nequivalent reference frames derived from space-time geometry, Einstein postulated that\nrotational motion is defined by \"the fixed stars\" -- a preferred frame ) So, while preferred\nframes are not eliminated, there is the additional complication of different frames for linear\nand rotational motion Another difficulty with the space-time interpretation of relativity is\nthat it does not account for the direction of entropy; an additional time-like factor of some\nsort seems to be required In this theory, as in Lorentz's \"Theory of Electrons, # one consistent, preferred frame of\nreference defines both linear and rotational motion Also, both incorporate classical time,\nwhich can be taken as directional in nature, giving a preferred direction for entropy However, in this theory, all relativistic transformations spring directly from the physical\nsystem involved, and need not be assumed ad hoc, as Lorentz did for relativistic contraction For a reference frame moving in the x direction, the Lorentz transform equations are:\n\n\n21\n\n\n_`x`_ � _`vt`_\n_`x`_ [�] �\n\n\n_`y`_ [�] � _`y`_\n\n\n_`z`_ [�] � _`z`_\n\n\n_`t`_ [�] � _`[t]`_ [�] _`[vx]`_ `[/]` _`[c]`_ `[ 2]`\n\n\n\n(3-1)\n\n\n(3-2)\n\n\n(3-3)\n\n\n(3-4)\n\n\n\nOf course, within the context of a preferred frame system, Eq (3-1) means that objects\nactually contract along their direction of motion Eq (3-4) means that moving clocks run\nmore slowly in an absolute sense And, moving clocks which are separated along their\ndirection of motion are desynchronized by an absolute amount of time For those unaccustomed to preferred frames, I'd like to illustrate their nature with a physical\nanalogy It’s a (tongue-in-cheek) thought experiment involving sound: Three nearsighted\ncowboys are riding atop a train, in the open air Our men are on different cars, with the\nlength of five identical cars separating each of them The two outside cowboys want to\nsynchronize their watches, but their distance vision is much too poor to use visual signals So they call to the middle cowboy to shoot his gun, and both start their watches when they\nhear the shot However, because the train is moving, the sound must travel farther through\nthe air to reach the forward cowboy than it does to reach the man in back The cowboy in\nthe middle, a bright fellow named Al, realizes there may be a problem So, to check their\nsynchronization, he has the other cowboys shoot their guns when their watches read exactly\none o'clock What does he hear Al hears two simultaneous shots On that basis, he decides that the watches really are\nsynchronized, and also concludes that the speed of sound outside is invariant with respect\nto moving trains His mistake, of course, was forgetting that the sound from the rear had to\ntravel farther through the air to reach him than the sound from up ahead This exactly\ncancels the discrepancy of the two watches So, he really has _no way of knowing_, from the\ntiming of sounds, whether the watches are actually synchronized or not * This is precisely\nthe way light behaves in preferred reference frame systems, such as the ether-based model\nof Lorentz *Some wonder whether Al might hear a difference in pitch between the two sounds, due to\nDoppler shifting Of course he would if he were stationary with respect to the air However,\nbecause of his motion, Al experiences Doppler shifts at the receiving end which cancel those\nat the sources For example, the sound from ahead is shifted to a lower absolute pitch, but\nhe intercepts these waves at an increased rate 22\n\n\nIt was Poincaré who first noted that, in a system like Lorentz's, if an observer's senses were\nmediated entirely by electromagnetic waves, he would have no way of discerning relativistic\neffects within his own reference frame, and no way of knowing how fast his frame is moving\nrelative to the ether Lorentz's theory does contain the ad-hoc assumption that moving\nparticles and objects contract along their direction of motion However, given this, the\nremaining effects of special relativity result naturally from the behavior of electromagnetic\nwaves traveling at a uniform speed through a fixed ether In its treatment of light, Lorentz's theory is an elegant one Although the contraction of\nmaterial objects is assumed, this assumption doesn't pertain to light; the lengths of light\nwaves are naturally correct as the result of Doppler shifting Time dilation automatically\nresults from these waves traveling increased distances through the ether in moving frames And, time desynchronization in moving frames results from light waves traveling with\ndiffering relative velocities in different directions, just like the sound waves in our cowboy\nanalogy (For a more complete discussion of Lorentz/Poincaré relativity, see J S Bell Bell argues 15\n\nthat their preferred-frame approach is preferable for teaching special relativity, and reiterates\nits experimental equivalence to Einstein's space-time He also describes how, for a classical\natom with a non-radiating electron, Lorentz's contraction assumption can be avoided by\ninvoking Maxwell's equations ) Having noted some appealing features of preferred frames,\nnow we'll take up relativity in the context of our new wave system As shown earlier, when this 4-D system is viewed from the perspective of a 3-D reference\nspace, the waves associated with pro-particles resemble de Broglie waves De Broglie based\nthe equations for his waves on Einstein's relativity; consequently, they are inherently\nrelativistic with respect to both space and time The waves in this new system will be seen\nto behave in the same relativistic fashion Also, we'll find that this automatically brings\nrelativistic behavior to our provisional particles (as well as to the realistic particles\nintroduced later) Recall that a pro-particle corresponds to a line in Euclidean 4-space, paralleling the 1 axis,\nand represents points of varying phase on redundant waves (Or a single point in our 3-D\nreference space ) The fronts of the associated waves all make the same angle with respect to\nthe line of the pro-particle And the points making up the 4-D pro-particle line all have the\nsame velocity vector, so they move together As we've seen, for a pro-particle to move in the\n3-D reference space, its associated wavefronts must be tilted with respect to 1 Here we'll\nlook at some hyperplane wavefronts and assume that they are tilted by some process which\nleaves the length of a given section of wavefront unchanged (A mechanism which tilts\nwaves in this fashion will be described later ) What effect would such tilting have on an\narrangement of our pro-particles Figs",

effectively measure time by the phases of their associated waves Below, we'll see that these assumptions can be superseded by a single, more definitive one:\nthat all our waves have been reflected at some point To obtain our wave transformation, our basic approach will be to ask what would happen\nto these waves if the \"mirrors\" from which they reflected had had different velocities We'll\nsee that, when the mirror velocity is changed, the reflected waves are transformed such that,\nwithin another relativistic frame, they have exactly the same configurations and states of\nmotion that they otherwise would have had In other words, the effect of this \"moving\nmirror transform\" is a complete Lorentz transformation What sort of \"mirror\" are we talking about In keeping with the rest of this theory, the\nmirrors we will be considering here are themselves wave-based phenomena While the\nphysical reflection mechanism won't be addressed until a later chapter, the point here is this:\nUnlike \"solid\" objects, these wave-based mirrors can pass through the wave medium without\nhaving to push it out of the way For example, suppose you had a sound-reflecting concrete\nwall moving through air; the induced airflow _around_ the wall would influence the\npropagation of reflecting sound waves Here, we won't be concerned with such an effect Since our wave system is redundant along 1, any wave-based mirror surface that may arise\nmust have an overall orientation parallel to this axis (That is, on a scale larger than the wave\nstructure's period, s ) We'll also add the working assumption that our mirror surfaces are\nlocally straight and continuous along 1 (This will be justified later, when the physical\nreflection mechanism is discussed )\n\n\nTo begin, we need a reflection law for our moving mirrors For a stationary mirror, there is\nthe familiar law of reflection: the angle of reflection equals that of incidence, with angles\nmeasured with respect to a surface normal This no longer holds when the mirror moves Here we'll use Huygens' principle to find a more general law, while making some qualitative\nobservations Fig 3-3(a) depicts a hyperplane wavefront being reflected by a moving mirror The mirror\nis a also hyperplane, perpendicular to the x axis, moving in the positive x direction with\nvelocity w A broken vertical line, M, represents the mirror at time t = 0, while the solid line, 0\nM, shows the mirror at a later time, t = 1 Both the incident and reflected waves are 1\nperpendicular to the x, 1 plane The bent angled lines, F and F, represent the wavefront at 0 1\ntimes t = 0 and t = 1 respectively The upper sections of F and F are moving up and to the 0 1\nleft, while the lower sections, having been reflected, are moving up and to the right 27\n\n\n**Fig 3-3 ** Reflection by a moving mirror In (a), M and M depict a mirror at times 0 1\nt=0 and t=1, respectively F and F are a reflecting wavefront at these times The 0 1\ncorresponding points of contact between wavefront and mirror are P and P In (b), 0 1\nthe mirror is omitted and the mirror/wavefront contact surface, S, is shown Also\nadded are normals to S at P and P A is an incident and B a reflected ray 0 1\n\n\n**Fig 3-4 ** Another case of reflection by a moving mirror Instead of moving toward\nit, here the mirror retreats from the incident wavefront 28\n\n\nAs shown in Fig 3-3(a), the wavefront contacts the mirror at P at time t = 0, and at P at t = 0 1\n1 A Huygens' wavelet originating from P at t = 0 becomes the semicircle shown at time t 0\n= 1 By Huygens' principle, the lower section of wavefront F must be tangent to this wavelet 1\nand pass through P A vector with magnitude c depicts the wavelet expansion and also the 1\nwavefront speed A smaller vector, with magnitude w, depicts the relative mirror velocity You can see that, for an increasing w, point P is shifted to the right of P This causes the 1 0\nreflected wavefront to approach a vertical orientation and reflected rays to approach the\nhorizontal, closer to a mirror normal (not shown) A second case is illustrated in Fig 3-4(a) Unlike the last, where the mirror moves toward\nthe incident wavefront, here it retreats, in the -x direction As a result, P is shifted to the left 1\nof P Here, the reflected wavefront has a less vertical orientation, and the reflected rays are 0\nless horizontal, deflected away from a mirror normal Summarizing, _when a mirror moves_\n_toward incident waves, the reflected rays are brought closer to a mirror normal Or, when the mirror_\n_retreats, reflected rays are shifted away from the normal_ Figs 3-3(b) and 3-4(b) show the same mirror/wavefront interactions depicted in parts (a) In parts (b), the mirror surface is not shown and the wavefront motion vectors are labeled\n**A** and **B** instead of c **A** and **B** can be taken to represent the movements of a pair of proparticles associated with the wavefront (Of course these vectors are normal to the\nwavefront ) The tails of these vectors lie on F and correspond to the positions of these pro- 0\nparticles at time t = 0, while the heads lie on F and correspond to t = 1 (Following previous 1\ndiagrams, the pro-particle positions at times t = 0 and 1 might have been illustrated with\nvertical lines These are omitted to keep the figure readable )\n\n\nAdded in Figs 3-3(b) and 3-4(b) is a line, S, running through points P and P S represents 0 1\nthe surface where, at different times, the mirror and wavefront make contact (S differs for\ndifferent wavefronts ) Also added are a pair of normals to S, at points at points P and P 0 1\nFrom the identical triangles bounded by F, 0 **A**, S and F, 1 **B**, S, you can see that the angle �\nbetween a normal to S and the incident pro-particle vector, **A**, equals the angle between a\nnormal and the reflected pro-particle vector, **B** _What we have, then, is just the ordinary law of_\n_reflection, except that, for each wavefront, we take as our mirror the mirror/wavefront contact_\n_surface_ * This is the generalized law for moving mirrors It says that what matters is not the\nmirror orientation per se, but where each point of a mirror is when a wavelet reflects from\nit Now we're ready to derive our wave transformation For simplicity, we'll be working with\nhyperplane mirrors (The same wave transformation also occurs with other mirror shapes )\nWe'll choose our coordinate system such that the x dimension is perpendicular to the mirror\nsurface In whatever direction the actual mirror may move, the velocity of its surface then\ncan then be given entirely in terms of its x component (This is because any y, z, or 1 velocity\ncomponents then are parallel to the surface and don't change its effective positioning )\n\n\n*Of course there is a second difference between ordinary reflection and reflection from\nmoving mirrors: Doppler shifting In addition to being tilted, wave trains are compressed\nand expanded, exactly like the wavefronts shown in Fig",
    "In addition to being tilted, wave trains are compressed\nand expanded, exactly like the wavefronts shown in Fig 2-2 29\n\n\nGiven that the mirror is a hyperplane, we can immediately address one of our earlier\nassumptions: that our waves are tilted by some means which leaves the length of a\nhyperplane wavefront section unchanged When the moving mirror and wavefronts are\nboth hyperplanes, the mirror/wavefront contact surface is a hyperplane also In this case,\nthe effective mirror is flat, of course, and reflection by a flat mirror doesn't change the length\nof a wavefront section Next, we'll begin to address the other assumption made in deriving the Lorentz transform that pro-particles effectively measure time by the phases of their waves In theories with\npreferred reference frames, like this one, time itself is unchanged in moving frames What\nchanges instead is the _behavior_ of things _in time_ -- velocities in particular (For example, the\nhands of a moving watch turn more slowly, in an absolute sense, than those of a watch at\nrest ) Below, we'll show that pro-particle velocities are transformed relativistically by the\nmotion of a reflecting hyperplane mirror Since their velocities necessarily determine the\nrates by which systems of pro-particles would gauge time, the previous assumption\nconcerning wave phases will be unnecessary First, from our generalized law of reflection, we'll derive a set of equations for the velocities\nof pro-particles reflected by moving mirrors Unlike the two-dimensional work done so far,\nhere we’ll describe all four dimensions of our system this (Consequently, the derivation is\na little long ) Then we'll use these equations to give us those for the relativistic\ntransformation of velocity 30\n\n\n#### Moving Mirrors in 4-D\n\nFig 3-5(a) shows the basic 4-D vectors we'll use to write a set of velocity equations for\nreflected pro-particles Each vector corresponds to a velocity with magnitude c * **A**\nrepresents the motion of an incident pro-particle, while **C** is the same pro-particle after\nreflection Also shown is a slanted line, S, which again represents the mirror/wavefront\ncontact surface Vector **B** is an artificial construct, normal to this fixed surface ( **B** doesn't\ncorrespond to the movement of anything ) As with ordinary reflection, from our generalized\nlaw, **-A**, **B**, and **C** are separated by equal angles and lie in a plane **Fig 3-5 ** Vectors used to describe 4-D reflection S is the\nmirror/wavefront contact surface On the right, vector **C** is\ndisplaced to show its relationship to **A** and **B** Given **A** and the mirror movement, we'll construct vector **B** Then, as illustrated in Fig 35(b), we can use the equation\n\n\n\n_**`C`**_ � _**`A`**_ � `2` _**`B`**_ `cos` �\n\n\n\n(3-17)\n\n\n\nto find **C** from vectors **A** and **B **\n\n\nThe plane of **A**, **B**, and **C** is generally skewed with respect to our coordinate axes, so these\nvectors have components in all four dimensions The components of **A** are\n\n\n\n_**`A`**_ � _**`i`**_ _`A`_ _`x`_ � _**`j`**_ _`A`_ _`y`_ � _**`k`**_ _`A`_ _`z`_ � _**`l`**_ _`A`_ 1\n\n\nwhere **i**, **j**, **k**, **l** are unit vectors in the positive x, y, z, 1 directions (3-18)\n\n\n\n*These ordinary 4-D vectors aren't the invariant \"four-vectors\" of standard relativity theory 31\n\n\nIn terms of our 3-D reference space, **A** 's components are\n\n```\n                 A v\n```\n\n_`x`_ � _`x`_\n\n\n_`A`_ _`y`_ � _`v`_ _`y`_\n\n```\n                 A v\n```\n\n_`z`_

(Later we’ll switch to the\nusual optical notation, where reflected rays are indicated with primes However, in the\nrelativistic equations we’ll be deriving here, primes signify moving reference frames )\n\n\nWhile 4-D vectors will be used to guide our analysis, what we're after are equations\ndescribing pro-particle reflection in 3-D terms Thus we'll be going back and forth between\nthe above 4 and 3-D velocity representations To find vector **B**, we need an equation for the mirror/wavefront contact hyperplane This\ncan be found by solving simultaneous equations for the mirror and incident wavefront We'll\nstart by writing the wavefront equation In our 4-D space, the normal form for the equation\nof a fixed hyperplane is\n\n\n\n_`x`_ `cos` �� _`y`_ `cos` �� _`z`_ `cos` ��1

positive x, y, z, 1 axes\nrespectively 32\n\n\nIf we take our wavefront to cross the origin at time t = 0, the perpendicular distance, p, from\nthe origin to the wavefront, is given by ct Since vector **A** is normal to the incident\nwavefront, the direction cosines of a perpendicular are given by **A** 's components divided by\nits magnitude, c",

47\n\n\nWe can pursue this analogy a little further We started with the conservation of two different\nquantities: pro-particle 1 phase velocity, and the energy of a free charged particle Note

new system and those of quantum mechanics We've seen now that pro-particles can precisely model various features of particles having\na single rest mass, m Of course, in nature, not all particles have the same mass Another 0\napparent shortcoming of this particle model is that, as ray analogues, pro-particles can be\npartially refracted and reflected Of course, when real particles, such as electrons, meet sharp\nchanges in the scalar potential, they are either \"refracted\" or reflected; the whole particle goes\none way or the other Pro-particles are just a construct (wave markers) that we've used to describe some\nfundamental characteristics of the waves in this system In a subsequent section, more\ncomplex wave-based entities will be introduced, which resemble real particles much more\nclosely However, because they exist within the same relativistic wave system, they may\ninherit much of the behavior of our provisional particles -- including their velocity behavior\nin 1 flows The realistic particle model assumes that 1 flows are, in fact, the physical basis\nof the scalar electric potential",
    "The realistic particle model assumes that 1 flows are, in fact, the physical basis\nof the scalar electric potential 48\n\n\n## 5 48\n\n\n## 5 Flow Waves and the Vector Potential\n\nIn the last section, we found a correspondence between the behavior of pro-particles in\nstationary 1 flows, and that of real charged particles in scalar potentials Taking a similar\napproach, here we'll describe pro-particles entering _moving_ 1 flows This will be compared\nto real particles entering moving scalar/vector potentials In so doing, we'll introduce the\nvector potential, while further defining the nature of the scalar potential in this theory A basis for moving 1 flows is provided by another feature of our wave system: its flows are\nnot steady ones, but are due to acoustic flow waves (So, while flows influence the\npropagation of waves, these also consist of waves themselves ) We'll see that the lateral\nmovement of 1 flows is made possible by this underlying wave nature To introduce\nacoustic flow waves, we'll begin by looking at the familiar example of sound waves in air A common device for describing sound wave generation is an air-filled cylinder with a\npiston Suppose we have a very long cylinder, aligned with the x axis, and a piston which\nmakes waves that propagate in the +x direction If the piston oscillates around a fixed point\n(like a stereo speaker), there is no net movement of the air in the cylinder and we have what\nare regarded as ordinary sound waves What happens if the piston does _not_ oscillate around a fixed point For example, suppose\nit starts abruptly, moves some distance in the positive x direction, and stops abruptly Here,\na rectangular flow wave pulse is created, with a density greater than the surrounding air As it moves down the cylinder, the effect of this pulse is to displace individual air particles,\non average, by the same distance traveled by the piston (Otherwise, near the piston, we\nwould see a lasting, local increase in the air density and pressure ) This pulse represents _a_\n_moving region of flow_, in which the average velocity of the air particles matches that of the\nmoving piston By repeatedly moving the piston, only in the positive x direction, and stopping it, we can also\ngenerate a series of such pulses Like the water solitons in Fig 1-5, the waves then would\ncarry an intermittent, but continuing, flow * Likewise, by repeatedly moving and stopping\nthe piston in the negative x direction, we can generate a train of pulses (moving positively\nin x) with negative relative density Note that, in this last case, the net flow is _opposite_ the\n\nwave movement \"Ordinary\" acoustic waves can be viewed as a special case of flow waves These involve flow\nwave components of both positive and negative relative density, where these components\nare exactly equal in magnitude and have identical velocity vectors *This progressive driving (as opposed to oscillating) mode of wave generation is common\nin nature For example, this is essentially how sound is produced when you speak or play\na wind instrument 49\n\n\nAs with steady flows, other waves are refracted and reflected by flow waves A simplified\nexample is illustrated in Fig 5-1 Parallel lines in the region on the right represent flow\nwaves, moving vertically in the 1 dimension An average downward flow, represented by\nthe vector U' is associated with these Here we'll assume that these waves are such that the\n\nfluid density inside the flow wave region is the same as that outside it (We can meet this\ncondition as described below ) Incident on the flow wave region is a wavefront associated\nwith longer-wavelength, small-amplitude waves As indicated by the vector c, this is\nmoving up and to the right **Fig 5-1",
    "5-1 ** Refraction and reflection by relatively short-wavelength flow waves Solid\nlines represent positive density waves, moving in the - 1 direction, while broken lines\nmark negative density waves, going the opposite way Vector U' indicates the\naverage net flow We know that, despite the chaotic motion of air particles at the molecular level, at larger\nscales, sound wave behavior is given by the _average_ motions of air particles From this, we\ncan infer that, if the scale of our flow waves is relatively minuscule, the refraction and\nreflection of larger-scale waves should be determined by only the average flow, U' (Also,\nwith very short-wavelength flow waves, we can neglect diffraction at the boundary ) So the\nfigure just depicts the usual refracted and reflected of wavefronts resulting from such a flow _This illustrates a nonlinear wave effect which is independent of the wave medium Instead, it depends_\n_entirely on a property of the waves themselves: their associated flow _\n\n\nNotice that the downward flow, U', in Fig 5-1 could be realized by either positive density\nwaves (solid lines) traveling downward or waves of negative relative density (broken lines)\ntraveling upward To meet our assumption that the fluid medium has the same average\ndensity inside the flow wave region as outside, these must be a balanced combination of both\ntypes (For example, if we had positive waves only, the net density in the flow wave region\nwould be greater ) As with \"ordinary\" acoustic waves, here we have equal positive and\nnegative density components But in this case, they are moving oppositely 50\n\n\nReferring again to a very long, air-filled cylinder, we can visualize the generation of such\ncomplementary flow waves In this example, instead of having a piston, the ends of the\ncylinder are plugged Here, waves are created inside the cylinder by moving the whole unit\nalong the x axis Suppose this cylinder is moved repeatedly, in the +x direction only, and\nstopped At one end plug, waves of positive density are produced, traveling in the +x\ndirection Also, from the opposite end, there are corresponding pulses of negative density,\ngoing in the -x direction With or without the waves, of course the net air density inside the\nclosed cylinder remains the same",
    "With or without the waves, of course the net air density inside the\nclosed cylinder remains the same *\n\n\nFig 5-2 5-2 Moving flow wave regions The 3-D velocity of their left edges is v, that of\nassociated pro-particles Positive and negative density flow waves are depicted in (a) and\n(b) respectively, while (c) represents a balanced combination In (c), the net average flow,\nU ', parallels the 3 1 axis *Ship waves are another example of balanced flow waves At the bow, where the hull\ndisplaces water, waves of positive net amplitude are produced Although less noticeable,\nat the stern, waves of negative amplitude are also created These bow and stern waves can\nmove independently, with different velocities and trajectories Since the overall ocean level\ndoesn't change, of course the net amplitudes must be exactly opposite 51\n\n\nHere we return to the present theory, and the mechanism for the movement of localized 1\nflows These move laterally in the x, y and z dimensions, without a corresponding migration\nof the surrounding fluid, stuff For steady flows, this would seem impossible However, as\nsuggested in Fig 5-2, such traveling flows can be realized on the basis of flow waves 5-2, such traveling flows can be realized on the basis of flow waves Fig Fig 5-2(a) shows a localized set of positive density flow waves, whose left edge is moving\nin the positive x direction Again, in this simplified example, we'll assume their wavelength\nis arbitrarily short, so diffraction can be neglected The edge's motion in the reference space\ncorresponds to that of a pro-particle associated with the waves, represented by vector v in\nthe vector triangle at the right The vector U ', shown underneath, represents the average 1\nflow associated with the waves Here this has the same direction as the wave motion, with\ncomponents in the negative 1 and positive x directions Another set of flow waves, with the same x velocity, v, appears in Fig",
    "Another set of flow waves, with the same x velocity, v, appears in Fig 5-2(b) These are\nmoving to the right, like the last set, but also upward, in the opposite 1 direction As\nindicated by broken lines, these are waves of negative relative density Here the associated\nflow, U ', is opposite the wave motion The 2 1 component of this flow is negative, as in (a),\nwhile the x flow component is opposite The 2 1 component of this flow is negative, as in (a),\nwhile the x flow component is opposite Fig Fig 5-2(c) shows a combination of two such wave sets This represents balanced waves of\npositive and negative density, where again the average fluid density inside the wave region\nequals that outside it Because they have the same velocity, v, in the reference space, the two\nwave sets travel together The average net flow, U, is given by the vector sum of U ' and U ' 3 1 2\nThe x components of the latter are exactly opposite, since these are the products of v and the\naverage wave amplitudes So, these cancel and U ' parallels the 3 1 axis (Note that, while the wavefronts in Fig 5-2(c) are depicted as straight, this may only be\ncorrect for small amplitudes At larger amplitudes, these waves may distort one another,\ngiving \"wavy\" fronts Also, at large amplitudes, the 4-D component wave velocities may\ndiffer from c Nevertheless, with appropriate tilts of the component waves, these should still\nmove together in the reference space )\n\n\nThis introduces another general quality of the wave system in this theory: _its flow waves are_\n_balanced, such that net flows only occur in the_ 1 _dimension _ (If not, it would follow that light or\nactual particles could be observed moving faster than c ) Below, we'll see that scalar/vector\npotentials correspond exactly to localized 1 flows, moving in x, y and z, without net\nmovements of the fluid itself in these dimensions While we've been primarily concerned with the refractive effects of 1 flows, they also reflect\nwaves, as illustrated in Fig 5-1 for a stationary flow wave region Earlier, in deriving the\nLorentz transform, we assumed a reflection mechanism aligned with the 1 axis This was\nassumed to move through the wave medium without inducing a flow around the mirror Notice that, _in these moving, wave-based_ 1 _flows, we have such a mechanism_ 52\n\n\nHow would the balanced waves of moving 1 flow regions transform if they _themselves_ were\nreflected by moving mirrors For small amplitude waves, our previous \"moving mirror\"\ntransform applies directly Transforming a stationary flow wave region, such as that\ndepicted in Fig 5-1, gives a moving region like that shown in Fig 5-2(c) As before, the 4-D\nlength of hyperplane wavefront sections is unchanged, while the width of a moving wave\nregion is contracted relativistically by the usual factor Since they have opposite 1 velocities,\nthe positive and negative density component waves tilt oppositely with respect to the\nreference space It's assumed that, _in combination_, the flow waves of this system transform relativistically at\nlarger amplitudes also (Because they are incomplete, the simplified waves of Figs 5-1 and\n5-2 probably would not behave properly at large amplitudes ) Another important\nassumption is that each complementary pair of wavefronts crossing the reference space\ncarries an invariant 1 displacement of the wave medium (As described later, it should be\npossible to check these assumptions by computer simulation ) _The average_ 1 _flow is then_\n_proportional to the flow wave frequency seen in the reference space_ Given this, what is the transformed 1 flow for a moving wave region Calling the region\nvelocity w now, at a fixed point in the reference space the flow wave frequency differs by the\nfactor Consequently, we can write the average `1/ 1` � _`w`_ `[2]` `/` _`c`_ `[2]` 1 flow seen at a fixed\npoint as\n\n\n```\n   0\n\n```\n\n\n(5-1)\n\n\n\nwhere U is the flow of a corres 0 ponding stationary wave region So, while the region width\ncontracts by the factor         , the effective flow per unit width increases by the `1` _`w`_ `[2]` `/` _`c`_ `[2]`\n\nreciprocal, and total flow is conserved In this respect, our wave-based flows behave the\nsame as ordinary ones, and our assumption that the associated 1 flow is proportional to the\nflow wave frequency seems justified Note that the wave frequency at a moving point in the reference space is dependant on its\nvelocity Consequently, the effective 1 flow at such a point depends on its velocity also",
    "Consequently, the effective 1 flow at such a point depends on its velocity also (I e ,\nif more flow waves are encountered, the effective flow increases, and vice versa ) For\nexample, at a point moving together with a flow wave region, the wave frequency is\ndecreased by So, calling the effective flow at such a moving position U, we `1` _`w`_ `[2]` `/` _`c`_ `[2]` w\nhave\n\n\n\n_`w`_ � `0` `1`\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n((5-2)\n\n\n**Fig 5-3 ** Refraction by a moving 1 flow region, with velocity w I and I represent the interface at times t=0 and t=1 respectively, 0 1\nwhile F and F again are the refracting wavefront (The refracted 0 1\npart of F is omitted ) Here the interface retreats from the incident 0\nwavefront and the refraction effect is enhanced **Fig 5-4 5-4 ** Another case of refraction by a moving 1 flow region Instead of retreating, here the interface approaches the incident\nwavefront In this case, the refraction effect is diminished 54\n\n\nWe've seen that it’s possible, in principle, to have wave-based, localized 1 flows which move\nin x, y and z, without the displacement of the surrounding fluid in these dimensions Given\nthat our flows move in this fashion, we can derive the vector potential Once more, we'll\nbegin by looking at refraction at a sharp interface Since this depends on the effective 1 flow\nat a position moving with the interface, we'll also take it that the transformed 1 flow is that\ngiven by Eq (5-2), for an interface velocity, w For a qualitative introduction to the vector potential, we'll assume for the moment that our\nrefracting 1 flows are effectively steady To visualize such flows, you could imagine that the\nresponsible waves are of a much smaller scale than the waves being refracted, like the\nexample of Fig",
    "To visualize such flows, you could imagine that the\nresponsible waves are of a much smaller scale than the waves being refracted, like the\nexample of Fig 5-1 Refraction by effectively steady, moving 1 flows is depicted in Figs Refraction by effectively steady, moving 1 flows is depicted in Figs 5-3 and 5-4 Fig 5-3\nshows a 1 flow retreating from an incident wavefront Again, F and F represent a single 0 1\nrefracting wavefront at times t = 0 and t = 1 (Only the incident portion of F is shown ) I 0 0\nand I are the flow region interface at these times The interface has a positive x velocity, 1\nindicated by the vector, w Within the flow region, there is a downward flow, parallel to the\n1 axis, indicated by the vector U ' (Remember that the amplitude of U ' is also a function **w** **w**\nof the region's velocity, w ) The successive points of intersection between wavefront and\ninterface are P and P 0 1\n\n\nThe semicircle in the figure represents a wavelet, originating from P, at time t = 0 Having 0\nbeen displaced by the flow U ', its center at time t = 1 is C As before, by Huygens' **w** 1\nprinciple, the refracted portion of wavefront F is tangent to this wavelet and passes through 1\nP However, unlike our earlier refraction examples, here P is displaced by the interface 1 1\nmovement This displacement, indicated by the vector, d, is along the incident wavefront As a result, in this case, the refraction is _increased_ by the interface movement For\ncomparison, the refracted wavefront and pro-particle vector for a stationary interface are\nshown as a dotted line and arrow Fig",
    "Fig 5-4 shows the same incident wavefront, but with the flow interface moving toward it,\nin the negative x direction As indicated by vector d, here P is shifted oppositely along the 1\nincoming

refracted waves\nin our system They will be compared to the effects of moving scalar/vector potentials on\nde Broglie waves Later, we'll use these wave frequencies to compare the velocity behaviors\nof pro-particles and actual charged particles Unlike our previous work with stationary 1 flows, where we only treated the x dimension\nof the reference space, here we'll describe all three of its dimensions What we're after is a\ngeneral equation for the wave frequency, seen at an arbitrary moving point in the reference\nspace We'll call the 3-D velocity vector for this point **u** Also, the waves of interest will be\ncharacterized by the 3-D velocity, **v**, of an associated pro-particle To begin, we'll write an expression for the frequency with no 1 flow In this case,

effective flow at a stationary point in the reference space Here we want this for an\narbitrary moving point As mentioned, the effective 1 flow depends on the frequency of the\nunderlying flow waves Treating the 1 flow as a second set of waves, we can use their\nfrequency to find it The velocity, **w**, of a moving 1 flow region corresponds to that of a pro-particle associated\nwith its flow waves Substituting **w** for the pro-particle velocity in Eq (5-6), we can write\nthis flow wave frequency as\n\n\n\n� _**`u`**_ �� `0`\n\n\n\n� #\n```\n(1 u w / c [2] )\n\n```\n\n\n(5-7)\n\n\n\nwhere

wavelength In this case, the values of s and � 0 for the flow waves are taken to be\ndifferent than for those being refracted Nevertheless, the transformation of this � 0 is the\nsame )\n\n\nSince the

    "Such self-organizing patterns\nare taken as the basis for the realistic particle model introduced in the next section 64\n\n\n## 6 64\n\n\n## 6 Wavicles\n\nJust as this theory involves a nonstandard interpretation of relativity, an alternate\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics is also involved As we'll see below, in the context of\nthis wave system, this permits a new, realistic model of elementary particles In the usual textbook interpretation, de Broglie waves are taken to be linear waves of pure\nprobability, whose squared moduli determine the likelihood of finding particles in particular\nstates These nonphysical waves propagate through increasing volumes of space (at speeds\ngreater than light) until instantaneously \"reduced\" by a measurement In the times between\nmeasurements, particles are taken not to exist in any definite state However, as discussed by Bell, what constitutes a \"measurement\" has never been clearly 21\n\ndefined Despite its widespread acceptance and its usefulness as a calculational tool, the\nstandard interpretation of quantum mechanics brings severe conceptual difficulties This has\nalso been pointed out by de Broglie, Schrödinger, Einstein, and Dirac -- each an architect 1 22 23 24\n\nof the existing quantum theory A second, distinctly different interpretation of quantum mechanics exists, which is equally\nconsistent with experiment (At least in the nonrelativistic case ) This is the \"hidden\"\nvariables theory of de Broglie, Bohm, and Vigier Here, de Broglie waves are taken to be real,\nnonlinear ones, and particles have definite states in the times between measurements * In\nsuch a theory, Heisenberg uncertainty derives from inherent limitations in the measurement\nprocess The present theory can be considered a relativistic extension of this one Until Bohm's paper of 1952, it was generally held that a self-consistent hidden variables **2**\n\ntheory was impossible A frequently cited proof to this effect had been published by von\nNeumann in 1932 (Although a serious flaw in von Neumann's proof was pointed out by\nGrete Hermann in 1935, her finding went largely unnoticed at the time ) Bohm refuted this\nidea by actually constructing a self-consistent theory of this type As Bell put it later, \"in\n1952, I saw the impossible done\" [26]\n\n\nBell's Theorem was developed in response to Bohm's work, to define the requirements for\na valid hidden variables theory It indicates that, in _any_ self-consistent theory of quantum\nmechanics, there are necessarily non-local effects, as there are in Bohm's While Bell was a\nproponent of hidden variables, their required non-local character has been taken by some as\nevidence against their existence However, it will be shown that similar non-local\nphenomena can be found in ordinary macroscopic systems So, while the present theory will\nbe seen to involve particle-like entities, existing more-or-less continuously in definite states,\nthis is not in conflict with the usual laws of quantum mechanics *Albert, Aharanov and D'Amato have also given strong theoretical evidence that particles 25\n\n_must_ have definite states between measurements 65\n\n\nAs mentioned, here elementary particles and their fields are based on self-organizing wave\npatterns What types of patterns might be expected to form within this repetitive, nonlinear\nsystem In the absence of computer simulation, we'll take as a guide the behavior of\nnonlinear, three-dimensional acoustic waves in ultrasonic wave tanks A characteristic effect arising in ultrasonic tanks is acoustic cavitation This involves the\nformation of microscopic bubbles, which expand and collapse with impinging waves *\nWhile bubbles are easily formed when the liquid contains dissolved gasses, these also arise\nin purified, degassed liquids Here they consist of a vapor or other form of the primary\nliquid In clouds of such bubbles, individual ones can exhibit surprising persistence A\nvariety of theories have been proposed to explain this, many involving assumed impurities\nin the liquid [28]\n\n\nUsually ignored in such theories is the self-organizational capacity of strongly nonlinear\nwave systems While waves determine where the bubbles are**, the latter also influence the\npropagation of waves (directly by reflection and also indirectly through the nonlinear\ninteraction of reflected and other waves) So it may be that these pulsating bubbles are\nsustained by feedback, where waves are directed _toward_ the bubble sites We'll assume that\nthis is so (This would also help explain the large wave amplifications observed ) Bubbles\nthen occupy the centers of more-or-less spherical standing wave patterns, with amplitudes\nvarying as the reciprocal square of the distance to the bubble center Could similar patterns arise in our 4-D wave system The simplest 4-D analogy would\ninvolve hyperspherical waves However, in this repetitive system, isolated hyperspherical\npatterns can't exist Instead, there would necessarily be an overlapping series of these,\nrepeating in the 1 dimension with the structure interval, s At some distance from the x, y,\nz center, the fronts of the combined waves would approximate hypercylinders, aligned with\nthe 1 axis Like 3-D spherical ones, the average amplitudes for such waves would vary as\n1/r, where the radius, r, parallels the reference space (For isolated hyperspherical waves, 2\n\nit would be 1/r ) 3\n\n\nNotice that, while we are constrained to repeating waveforms, our four-dimensional system\nstill has another degree of freedom not found in a three-dimensional one Besides\nhypercylindrical patterns, hyper _conical_ ones of various shapes are also permitted (The\nformer are a special case of these ) Fig 6-1 depicts sections of several hyperconical fronts\n\n\n*A remarkable aspect is the extreme concentration of wave energy occurring during bubble\ncollapse In water, this can cause a bluish or violet light emission called sonoluminescence Energy gains of over 10 have been reported The energies attained are so great that, for 12\n\nbubbles containing a deuterium/tritium mixture, measurable thermonuclear fusion may be\npossible [27]\n\n\n**This is demonstrated clearly in single-bubble sonoluminescence experiments, where the\nbubble's position is governed by focussed waves, overriding its gravitational tendency to\nrise [29]\n\n\n66\n\n\n**Fig 6-1 ** Hyperconical wavefront sections, depicted in terms of 1, plus an

    "Although the component waves are still hyperconical, their shape also changes with wavicle\nvelocity In Fig 6-6(c) the line segment F represents a section of a component wavefront,\nwhile � is its angle with respect to the hypercone axis and vector N While N represents the\nmotion of a node associated with F, the perpendicular vector, c, indicates the movement of\nthis component wavefront section As shown, � is given by\n\n\n\n`sin` �� _`c`_ `/` _`N`_\n\n\n\n(6-25)\n\n\n\nAt large wavicle velocities, where N diminishes toward c, the quantity on the right again\ngoes to 1, and � to 90 ( Consequently, the hypercones open out, and approach hyperplanes\nin the limit So, at velocities very close to the speed of light, the component fronts\napproximate hyperplane waves, traveling in the x direction, with velocity c (Further, the incident and reflected portions of a single wavefront no longer have the same\naxis, although both axes parallel N Projecting both hypercones inside the core, the vertex\nof each is at the core center However the two vertices are offset in the 1 dimension, so the\ntwo axes are displaced from each other, as shown in Fig 6-6(a) 6-6(a) Speaking in terms of the\nthree dimensions of the figure, the core node where the two [hyper]cones join is an ellipse This shape also characterizes the nodes in general )\n\n\n76\n\n\n_In contrast to the component waves, which remain hyperconical, Moiré wavefronts are essentially_\n_hyperplanar _ As shown in two dimensions in Fig 6-4, in a stationary wavicle, these are\nperpendicular to the 1 axis For a wavicle moving steadily in the x reference space\ndimension, the hyperplanes are tilted in x and 1, as illustrated in Fig",
    "For a wavicle moving steadily in the x reference space\ndimension, the hyperplanes are tilted in x and 1, as illustrated in Fig 6-5 6-5 Also, from our\nrelativistic transform, there is no tilting with respect to y or z, so the resulting hyperplanes\nremain perpendicular to the x, 1 plane The basic shape difference between component and Moiré wavefronts is a crucial one _Since_\n_the Moiré fronts of a uniformly moving wavicle are hyperplanar, these appear as infinite plane waves_\n_in the reference space, exactly like the de Broglie waves of a uniformly moving particle It follows that,_\n_knowing only the spatial arrangement of its Moiré wavefronts, one can infer the momentum of such_\n_a wavicle, but not its position _\n\n##### Flow Wave Effects and the Wavicle Core\n\n\nAs described, a stationary wavicle has a flow wave pattern with an amplitude and average\n1 flow varying as 1/r Since the wave pattern of a moving wavicle contracts relativistically, 2\n\nits flow pattern must do this also In addition, its average (fixed-position) flow wave\nfrequency increases relativistically Given that a wavicle's 1 flow is proportional to both\nwave amplitude and frequency, total 1 flow is then conserved This matches the\nconservation of charge in an actual particle, where contracted (ellipsoidal) equi-potential\nsurfaces enclose increased potentials For a wavicle in an external 1 flow (corresponding to a charged particle in a potential), its\nwave pattern can be expected to move with the effective 1 flow, as described previously for\npro-particles As depicted in Fig",
    "As depicted in Fig 6-3, we have component waves of both relative densities,\nmoving in oppositely with respect to 1 Consequently, half are augmented in frequency,\nwhile the other half are decreased by an equal amount This gives an average frequency and\nassociated 1 flow which are unchanged This gives an average frequency and\nassociated 1 flow which are unchanged I e , net 1 flow is still conserved, just as charge is\nfor an actual particle in an external potential _Thus we have a complete model of a relativistic,_\n_quantized charge _\n\n\nAgain, for a given wavicle pattern having a specific rest frequency, an inverted pattern with\nan opposite 1 flow is also possible As you might expect, _the two cases are taken to represent_\n_corresponding particles and antiparticles _ Of course wavicles with positive 1 flows are the ones\nwe'll choose to equate with positively charged particles In the simplified wavefront diagrams above, we've assumed that a wavicle's components\nmove at a constant velocity, c, and thus can retain a hyperconical shape Clearly this is\nreasonable at large distances from the core, where the amplitudes and nonlinear effects are\nvanishing What happens in the region close to the core (this may be relatively small), where\nthe flow wave amplitudes are great Here the picture is less clear Here the picture is less clear 77\n\n\nFor individual component waves taken in isolation, it may be that their speed would vary\nwith amplitude (Like familiar shock waves, the waves with greater density might move\nfaster ) Taken together, we also expect a wavicle's components to simultaneously reflect,\nrefract, and displace one another In a balanced system, where the overall density remains\nconstant, some of these nonlinear effects may tend to cancel So it's conceivable that the\neffective component wave velocities might remain approximately c near the core (This would imply that the flow wave interactions within wavicles differ from those between\nwavicles Similar behavior is observed in solitons, where the component wave interactions\ndiffer from those of whole solitons )\n\n\nWhatever transpires near the wavicle center, it's required that, after leaving this region, the\nvarious outgoing component waves should be the reflected equivalent of those incoming (This is necessary to conserve 1 flow, density, and energy together ) _Since wavicles are taken_\n_to be self-organizing, there should also be feedback in the core region, actively adjusting the waves to_\n_fit this pattern _ It's hoped that such behavior can be verified by modeling wavicles\nnumerically",
    "_ It's hoped that such behavior can be verified by modeling wavicles\nnumerically And the core The example of acoustic cavitation suggests the possibility of a distinct\nsurface, representing a sharp discontinuity in the properties of the wave medium outside and\ninside the core (To simulate such a wavicle numerically, it would be necessary to model a\nseparate set of conditions existing inside the core ) With an overall alignment paralleling the\n1 axis, the surface conceivably might be a tubular one, rippled by impinging waves Or, it\ncould consist of separate bubbles, in a periodic string with the same orientation To describe the possible interactions of wavicles, we can begin by considering the responses\nof individual wavicles to external 1 flows Along the lines of our earlier work with proparticles, we can approach this from the standpoint of an individual wavicle encountering\na \"sharp\" change in 1 flow (electrical potential) However, here all external 1 flows are to\nbe attributed to other wavicles So in this case, the external flow wave pattern is necessarily\ncomplex, with the actual 1 flow at a given instant depending on the positions, phases, etc So in this case, the external flow wave pattern is necessarily\ncomplex, with the actual 1 flow at a given instant depending on the positions, phases, etc of the various other wavicles Earlier, we saw that the component waves in this system are simultaneously reflected and\ntransmitted at a sharp 1 flow interface However, for a wavicle to persist, the overall system\nmust \"decide\" whether the whole entity is to be transmitted or reflected The system's\nbehavior must be such that, after the wavicle's motion changes, waves originating from prior\ntimes continue to arrive at its future core position To conserve the total momentum of the\nsystem, other wavicles necessarily undergo opposing changes of motion And these also\nmust continue to receive incoming waves 78\n\n\nSimilar behavior is found in other nonlinear wave systems, such as that of Zabusky and\nKruskal, cited in Section 1 Each of its various solitons can be viewed as a collection of 8\n\nFourier component waves, shared with the others in the system As the solitons interact and\ntheir individual velocities change, all the various components are observed to change with\nthem, accordingly Thus each hump retains its due share of component waves and persists\nindefinitely (Since they interact and pass through one another \"without losing their form\nor identity,\" wavicles could possibly be classified as solitons However, the term normally\nrefers to running waves, rather than standing wave patterns )\n\n\nFrom our earlier pro-particle work, a free wavicle's velocity can be expected to change if it\nenters a different 1 flow Also, we’ve seen that the wave pattern depends on its velocity So\nas the wavicle core crosses the interface, its pattern must change -- initially for the impinging\nwaves close to the core This presumably occurs via a nonlinear wave interaction -- one\nwhich simultaneously alters the patterns of other wavicles in the system The region of\nnonlinear interaction should then expand outward In this theory, _such propagating disturbances in the patterns of wavicles represent electromagnetic_\n_waves _ (Here electromagnetic waves alone can't exist In \"empty\" space, they represent\ndisturbances in the wave fields of distant matter )\n\n\nAs described, the Moiré waves of wavicles are taken to correspond to de Broglie waves Note that a wavicle has two sets of Moiré waves -- one associated with its positive density\ncomponents, and another with those of negative relative density The wavelengths of the\ntwo sets in the reference space are always identical However, in external 1 flows their\nfrequencies differ Again, for actual charged particles in scalar potentials, the de Broglie frequency and energy\n(or Hamiltonian) are related by\n\n\n\n_`h`_ �� _`E`_ �\n\n\n```\n m c [2]\n  0\n```\n\n� [�] _`[q]`_ [0]\n\n\n\n(6-26)\n\n\n\nSo, where the charge, q, and scalar potential, 0, are of the same sign, the de Broglie\nfrequency, �, is increased For a wavicle in a 1 flow of the same sign, its positive Moiré\nwaves are increased in frequency, analogously Meanwhile, the frequency of its negative\nones is decreased Thus, if wavicles are to behave like actual particles, it's their _positive_ density Moiré waves\nwhich must correspond to de Broglie waves For example, if a wavicle enters a stationary\n1 flow region, its velocity should change such that the positive Moiré frequency is conserved It may be difficult to show directly that wavicles act this way However, it's reasonable that\nthey would, since the total energy, momentum and 1 flow of the system are conserved if\nthey do Again, it may be possible to verify this through computer simulation 79\n\n\nGiven that our system behaves this way, we have entities which both generate and respond\nto potentials as actual particles do And, based on different characteristic wave angles,\nparticles of different masses can be modeled Tentatively, we'll take individual wavicles to\nrepresent the charged leptons: the electron, muon, tauon and their antiparticles Since there\nis no evidence of internal structure in these, single wavicles with small cores may be an\naccurate representation Again, this avoids the problem of infinite fields encountered in\nstandard field theory,* where these particles are treated as point charges *To this end, a very similar model of electrons and muons was proposed by Dirac in 1962 [32]\n\nIn it, the electron is viewed as \"a bubble in the electromagnetic field\", of finite size The\nmuon is then taken to be an excited state of the electron, involving radial pulsations of the\nbubble and a spherically symmetrical wave field",

additional sections of this paper are planned, but incomplete at this point Here I'd\nlike to try to give some sense of what these are about and to introduce some of the key ideas (At my usual glacial pace, it will be some time before the remaining sections are written So\nit seems best to go ahead, publish this much, and finish later ) Also, the concluding section,\nwhich follows this one, is more-or-less complete #### Quantum Mechanics\n\n\nOne added section will address quantum mechanics, with particular attention to the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen, or EPR, effect The starting point is the observation that, for a\nwavicle to persist, even its simplest behaviors require the coordinated action of the overall\nwave system Thus a wavicle's actions are necessarily determined by non-local factors Such\nnon-locality is also characteristic of the EPR effect It's sometimes said that each part of a nonlinear wave system \"knows\" what the other parts\nare doing The quasicrystalline wave structures mentioned in Section 1 are a clear example (As Penrose points out, the formation of a quasicrystalline patterns requires knowledge of 33\n\nremote parts of a system ) Connected, non-local wave phenomena of this sort can be seen\nas the result of nonlinear coupling (Like that of nonlinearly coupled pendulums or\noscillators ) Such coupling is expected with the pulsations of wavicles, and is taken as the\nbasis for quantized de Broglie wavelengths, such as those of electrons in atoms Again, the present work is related to Bohm's \"hidden variables\" theory, where particles exist 2\n\ncontinuously in definite states and follow definite trajectories In it, de Broglie waves and\nparticles are influenced by an additional \"quantum-mechanical\" potential or \"quantum\npotential, # which has a non-local aspect Bohm's theory is based on the non-relativistic\nSchrödinger wave equation\n\n\n\n\n[0][5]\n\n0 _`t`_ [��6] `2` `[2]`\n\n\n\n_`i`_ 6 [0][5]\n\n\n\n`2` _`m`_ [/] `[ 2]` [5�]

vector, **v**, is given by\n\n\n_**`v`**_ �/ _`S`_ `/` _`m`_\n\n\n\nHe then showed that, if the quantum potential were to fluctuate randomly, such particles\nwould behave exactly in accordance with the usual statistical laws of quantum mechanics -despite following well-defined trajectories (Striking computer-modeled trajectories of\nparticles in quantum potentials can be found in Philippidis et al or Vigier et al ) Bohm and 34 3\n\nVigier subsequently proposed random fluctuations in a fluid wave medium as a physical 2\n\nbasis for the quantum potential Toward a relativistic theory, Vigier has since proposed a \"sub-quantum Dirac ether\" as the 3\n\nfluid medium Unlike real fluids, the elements of a Dirac ether have no specific states (Dirac describes it as analogous to the concept of particle clouds, where particles lack 35\n\ndefinite states ) \"Manifest\" relativistic covariance then is permitted by the fact that there is\nno overall state of motion However, this is inconsistent with the basic de Broglie/Bohm\ntheory, where particles have definite states and the wave medium is taken to be physically\nreal On the other hand, the present theory offers an appropriate medium which is both\nrelativistic and realistic At this point, we'll introduce another feature of wavicles In the previous section, their\nwavefronts were illustrated as perfectly symmetrical hypercones, for simplicity However,\nin a realistic case, where the source of a wavicle's incident waves is others, the patterns are\nnecessarily irregular to some degree (There is no way to generate perfectly symmetrical\nhyperconical wavefronts from sources at discrete, scattered sites ) While feedback maintains\na wavicle's average 1 flow, such asymmetries would result in intermittent fluctuations in the\n1 flow seen at the core, and changes in its motion Chaotic 1 flow fluctuations of this nature\nare taken to correspond to Bohm's quantum potential 82\n\n\n#### Gravitation and Cosmology\n\nIn Einstein's version of general relativity, gravitation is based on a varying non-Euclidean\nspace-time, and an absolute speed of light In this theory, gravity is associated with local\nvariations in the speed of light, while space and time (in a preferred frame) are absolutes For very strong gravitational fields, or large astronomical distances, the two theories make\nvery different, testable predictions Like the electromagnetic forces, the source of gravitation here lies in the wave fields of\nwavicles In concentrations of matter containing oppositely charged wavicles, the average\n1 flows tend to cancel at large distances, like the electric fields of conventional particles However, _the underlying wave fields do not cancel _ The cumulative waves fluctuate more-orless randomly, with an rms amplitude varying approximately as 1/r from the center of 2\n\nmass, like the wave fields of individual wavicles The resulting irregular fluctuations of the\nwave medium are taken to represent gravitational potentials (Thus these and the quantum\npotential are related )\n\n\nThe key to gravitation in this system is the dependance of the rate of physical processes on\nthe 4-D wave speed, c Our wave-based gravitational potentials act by reducing this general\nvelocity (This may be attributable to disruption of rectilinear wave propagation by the\nmedium's fluctuations For example, a ray traveling from point a to point b experiences\nsmall-scale excursions which increase the total path length, effectively decreasing the wave\nvelocity ) As c is reduced, everything is slowed proportionately -- the movements of\nwavicles, the propagation of electromagnetic waves, etc Clocks in gravitational potentials are perceived by outside observers to be slowed, as usual Light is also bent in a gravitational field In this case, though, the effect corresponds to\nordinary refraction (Of course refractive index goes as the inverse of wave speed ) As a\nresult, the local behavior of physical systems in gravitational fields matches that in\naccelerating frames -- i e , Einstein's principle of equivalence is met For comparing Einstein's account of gravity with this one, the concept of optical path length\nis useful Often used in evaluating optical systems, this is computed by multiplying the\nlengths of light rays in optical elements by the refractive indices there While treated as\ndistances, these products are actually a measure of the time required for a wavefront to\ntransit an element (In an ideal imaging system, the summed optical path lengths between\ncorresponding object and image points are the same for all rays This says that all parts of\na wavefront arrive at an image point simultaneously -- in phase ) Still, in terms of light\nwavelengths, a material with an index above one behaves as though additional space is\ncompressed inside it 83\n\n\nEinstein assumes that optical path lengths in gravitational potentials are the same as spatial\ndistance Here, as in ordinary optical systems, they aren't As a result, different\narrangements of things in space are predicted For weak gravitational fields and modest\nastronomical distances, like those within the solar system, the differences are minute At\ncosmological scales, however, these should be apparent Because c isn't sacrosanct in this theory, an alternate basis for the Hubble redshift is also\npermitted Here, c is taken to be gradually increasing Since this corresponds to the rate of\nall processes (at the macroscopic level), at the time of emission, the spectra of remote galaxies\nwould have been lower in frequency than present ones So we're again invoking a varying\nwave speed, instead of a varying space-time To provide for a changing c, we'll take the wave medium, stuff, to resemble a real gas, with\nparticle-like constituents The characteristic acoustic wave velocity then depends on the\neffective temperature and density We can also suppose that the constituents of stuff are also\nwave-based entities (like tiny wavicles), associated with some finer coherent structure If\nenergy is gradually transferred between wave structures at different scales, we then have a\nmechanism for changes in these qualities of stuff at the macroscopic level (Stuff is assumed to have a fractal-like nature, with wave structures arising and subsiding\nat widely differing scales In this respect there's a resemblance to \"inflationary\" cosmological\nmodels )\n\n\nSuch energy transfers occur naturally in nonlinear wave systems Not only from large waves\nto small, but also in the opposite direction * An important example was discovered in\ncomputer-modeled waves by Fermi, Pasta and Ulam in the 1950's Prior to their work, it 10\n\nwas widely believed that nonlinearity in waves inevitably leads to thermodynamic behavior,\nwhere orderly large-scale waves degenerate into random small-scale ones The system\nstudied was one-dimensional, with a discrete length Initially, a large sinusoidal wave was\nseen to transform into various configurations of smaller ones However, the process\neventually reversed, with the small waves coalescing back into the starting waveform (The\neffect is now called FPU recurrence Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam also inspired the computer\nexperiments of Zabusky and Kruskal, discussed earlier )\n\n\nIt seems clear that general qualities of the universe do undergo long-term changes In the\ncourse of stellar evolution, a substantial fraction of the collective mass in stars is being\nconverted to neutrinos However, the bulk of these are undetected and unaccounted for It's\nconceivable that much of the lost energy is transferred to a smaller-scale wave structure,\nhelping raise the effective \"temperature\" of stuff at that level, and the value of c *Large ocean waves are now thought to grow from smaller ones overtaken [7]\n\n\n84\n\n\nAccording to Einstein's general relativity and the standard Big Bang model, a curved, finite,\nexpanding space-time is the basis of the Hubble redshift On the other hand, _the repeating_\n_wave system in this theory requires a Euclidean space _ Since different topologies are predicted,\nthe two theories can be tested by determining the structure of space Of course any direct\nobservation of space-time curvature (including entities such as wormholes) would invalidate\nthe new theory The large-scale curvature of space can be estimated (at least to an order of magnitude) by\ncounting galaxies within different radii from our position In a flat space, the numbers\nwould increase approximately as the cube of the radius, while a curved space-time should\ndeviate from this Studies of this kind, for example by Loh and Spillar, have indicated that 36\n\nspace is either flat, or very close to it According to Linde, the discrepancy between the 37\n\nobserved curvature and that predicted by Einstein's general relativity and the standard Big\nBang model is roughly _sixty_ orders of magnitude This extreme disagreement is called the\n\"flatness problem #\n\n\nWhile the present theory predicts flatness, it may seem trivial, since a Euclidean space was\nassumed at the outset * However, note that this assumption is an essential element of the\nbasic theory, and not something added to fit certain astronomical data In comparison, the\nassumptions regarding space are much more complex in Einstein's theory There space is\nMinkowskian, also curved by the presence of matter, and possibly further reshaped by an\nadditional cosmological constant ** Of course the overriding point is that, unlike the\nstandard Big Bang model, here space-time curvature is _not required_ Recent observations pertaining to the age of the universe also appear to contradict the Big\nBang Attributing the redshifts of remote galaxies to recessional velocities, the predicted age\ncan be obtained by dividing the distances of galaxies by their apparent velocities Using the\nHubble Space Telescope to estimate the distance of the galaxy M100, Freedman et al have 38\n\nput the universe's age at approximately 8 billion years -- less than the estimated age of its\noldest stars The discovery of highly-developed large-scale structures, such as the Great Wall and Great\nAttractor, also argues for an older universe than that allowed by the standard Big Bang\nmodel In this theory, the age of the universe isn't similarly constrained, since the Hubble\nredshift is not attributed to an expanding universe Ancient stars are permitted, and mature\nlarge-scale structures are expected *Poincaré argued that the true geometry of the universe _must_ be Euclidean **The cosmological constant, �, from Einstein's early gravitational field equations, has been\nproposed as a means of dealing with the flatness problem Still, even with the reintroduction of this extra, arbitrary quantity, a sufficiently flat space appears unattainable\nwithin the constraints of standard Big Bang cosmology [37]\n\n\n85\n\n\n#### Nuclear Forces and Sub-particles\n\nThis part of the theory is more tentative; at this point it's only qualitative Presently, nuclear forces are taken to be relatives of the Casimir effect The latter involves\nvacuum fluctuations (random electromagnetic waves occurring in \"empty\" space) which are\nsuppressed in regions between parallel conducting plates As a result, waves are reflected\ndisproportionately from the outside plate surfaces, creating a small pressure driving the\nplates together The force varies as the inverse of the plate spacing, to the fourth power Due to their finite sizes, similar effects may arise between reflecting wavicle cores Although\nthese are not flat plates, in close proximity, they would shield one another somewhat from\nincident component waves Also, since the component wave amplitudes are extreme near\nthe cores, a large attractive force could arise at short distances This effect, which depends\nin part on the wavicle core sizes and the characteristic hyperconical wave angles, is the\nassumed basis of nuclear forces (The feedback which sustains the individual wave patterns\nis also taken to oppose the complete merging of wavicles )\n\n\nSince multiple nonlinear effects are involved, it appears difficult to test this idea by analytical\nmethods However, it may be possible to verify it through computer simulation of the wave\nsystem (A possibly related effect is seen in ultrasonic wave tanks, where the cavitating fluid\ncontains particulate impurities The wave action tends to drive these together, forming\naggregates which precipitate out The process is sometimes used to purify fluids Suspended particles of metal powder can be driven together so forcefully that they partially\nmelt and fuse ) 39\n\n\nBesides constituting nuclei, bound groupings of wavicles may also be needed to account for\nthe internal structure of hadrons If so, the binding forces might be similar to those of nuclei In the prevailing quark model, the constituents of hadrons have fractional charges On the\nother hand, in the current version of this theory, uniform (or nearly uniform) elementary\ncharges are called for A compromise might be to assume that both hadrons and leptons\nhave constituents with charges of ± D e A model of this nature has been proposed by\nHarari, for example 40\n\n\nStill, fractional charges have never been observed directly Also, the prevailing quark model\nis contradicted by recent measurements of the proton's spin magnetic moment, which give\nonly about one third the predicted value (The \"spin crisis 41 # ) Since charge and spin\n\nmagnetic moment are related, one wonders whether this might indicate that hadrons actually\nhave constituents with integral charges As described by Nambu and Han, various models 42\n\nbased on quark-like sub-particles with integral charges have been suggested in the past 86\n\n\n#### Computer Modeling\n\nAgain, some wave behaviors required by this theory are difficult to verify analytically (The\nevolution of nonlinear waves in a gas-like medium can be viewed as an extreme example of\nthe many-body problem -- with each particulate constituent a separate body ) However, it\nmay be possible to do this though computer modeling (No modeling has been attempted\nat this point ) Some basic questions to be answered are:\n\n\n1 ) Can a wave system of this kind remain balanced (Complimentary\npositive and negative density flow waves, balanced such that net flows only\narise in the 1 dimension )\n\n\n2 ) To arrive at the vector potential, we assumed that the effective 1 flow\nexperienced by pro-particles at their moving positions is proportional to the\nfrequency of flow waves encountered",
    ") To arrive at the vector potential, we assumed that the effective 1 flow\nexperienced by pro-particles at their moving positions is proportional to the\nfrequency of flow waves encountered Does this hold 3 3 ) Are self-organizing flow wave patterns resembling wavicles observed ) Are self-organizing flow wave patterns resembling wavicles observed 4 ) Do these exhibit quantum-mechanical behaviors As discussed in Section 1, the computer experiments of Zabusky and Kruskal modeled an\ninfinite one-dimensional system of nonlinear waves Because these were periodic, it was\nonly necessary to model a single region equal in length to the period Waves were wrapped\naround from one edge of the region to the other With respect to the 1 dimension, we can\ndo the same for the periodic waves of this system With respect to the 1 dimension, we can\ndo the same for the periodic waves of this system **Fig 7-1 7-1 ** 3-D representation of a rectangular hyperbox-shaped region for\nmodeling the evolution of waves in this system Depicted are 1, plus two\narbitrary reference space dimensions While only a single layer of the system needs representation in the 1 dimension, a relatively\nbroad region needs to be covered in x, y, and z A simple choice of region to model would\nbe a thin, rectangular hyperbox, illustrated in three dimensions in Fig A simple choice of region to model would\nbe a thin, rectangular hyperbox, illustrated in three dimensions in Fig 7-1 The box height,\ns, is the 1 period of the wave structure 87\n\n\nWaves at the top and bottom of the hyperbox would wrap around To prevent waves from\nescaping, the sides could be treated as mirrors Of course standing waves in a cavity are\nstrongly influenced its shape (A contained wavicle might be seen to behave like a quantummechanical particle in a box ) A hyperbox with an irregular footprint in the reference space\nmight give a better approximation of waves evolving in an infinite space Another possible way to maintain the waves would be to also wrap them from side wall to\nopposite side wall, instead of reflecting them Further strategies could be used to reduce the\nregularity of the \"cavity # For example, different sections of a given side could be wrapped\nto sections of various other sides Instead of wrapping directly across, opposite sides could\nbe wrapped with a twist Wrapping and reflection could be combined (Reflection is\nessentially wrapping a side to itself ) Etc",
    ") Etc The medium, stuff, could be represented either as a continuous fluid, or one with discrete,\nparticle-like constituents For a realistic simulation in four dimensions, the required number\nof particles or fluid elements is huge -- almost certainly more than 10 (Enough to challenge 11\n\na massively parallel supercomputer )  Modeling an analogous three-dimensional system 43\n\nwould cut the computational demands greatly Something similar to wavicles, with conical rather than hyperconical wavefronts, might arise\nin 3-D systems However, if such patterns occur, their associated 1 flows would vary as 1/r,\nrather than 1/r, giving them very different dynamical properties Because wavicles depend 2\n\nfor their existence on interactions with others, lacking the same dynamics, their analogues\nmay not form Even so, basic questions about the behavior of 4-D wave systems should still\nbe answerable from three-dimensional experiments (For example, questions 1 and 2 above )\n\n\nProbably the biggest obstacle to constructing an accurate model is the fact that the specific\ncharacteristics of stuff are unknown at this point Like real fluids, the behavior of stuff may\nchange abruptly at critical points From the example of ultrasonic cavitation bubbles in pure\nwater, stuff inside a wavicle core may have sharply different properties * A possible\napproach to modeling wavicle formation would be to take an arbitrary set of balanced flow\nwaves, and \"seed\" it with hyperbubbles, aligned with the 1 axis (The stuff inside these\ncould be assigned a much higher wave velocity, for example ) Waves might nucleate around\nthese, forming wavicle-type patterns, with hyperbubbles as cores Zabusky and Kruskal's modeling of a one-dimensional, repeating wave system was very\nilluminating In higher-dimensioned systems like this one, it seems likely that richer forms\nof self-organization will be found Whatever the wave behaviors may be, it’s certain they'll\nbe interesting *Even knowing something of the properties of normal water, we don't yet have a good model\nfor the waves surrounding acoustic cavitation bubbles",
    "*Even knowing something of the properties of normal water, we don't yet have a good model\nfor the waves surrounding acoustic cavitation bubbles 88\n\n\n## 8 88\n\n\n## 8 The Course of Physics\n\nAll of modern physics is built on Einstein's interpretation of special relativity Included is\nhis view that, a priori, systems with preferred frames, like Lorentz's, must be ruled out (In\ncontrast, Lorentz was willing to concede the possible validity of Einstein's space-time\napproach ) In the early years, this exclusionary position was criticized by leading theorists Sommerfeld, for example, called it \"unhealthy dogmatism # However, after the apparent\nconfirmation of Einstein's general relativity, his views were adopted by the physics\ncommunity at large The various founders of quantum mechanics unanimously took space-time as its framework In his stand against the ether, Einstein had argued we should not speak of things that can't\nbe measured Heisenberg, Bohr, and others extended this philosophy also to quantum\nmechanics Their Copenhagen interpretation says that, for the same reason, we shouldn't\nspeak of hidden variables This viewpoint found its ultimate expression in Bohr's statement\nthat the quantum mechanical microworld \"doesn't exist #\n\n\nAs we know, Einstein was dismayed by this, and took a lonely (and courageous) stand in\ndefense of the principle of causality Eventually, a talk with Einstein turned Bohm against\nthe Copenhagen interpretation, and spurred the development of his hidden variables theory Bohm's success also inspired de Broglie to resurrect his related \"pilot wave\" theory Neither\nwas endorsed by Einstein, however, who saw a conflict between his own conception of\nrelativity, and the non-local effects described by Bohm Both de Broglie and Bohm were devout believers in Einstein and Minkowski's space-time However, Bell has noted that their theory appears to require a preferred frame of reference He writes:\n\n\nI think that conventional formulations of quantum theory, and of quantum field\ntheory in particular, are unprofessionally vague and ambiguous Professional\nphysicists ought to be able to do better Bohm has shown us a way It will be seen\nthat all the essential results of ordinary quantum field theory are recovered But it\nwill be seen also that the very sharpness of the reformulation brings into focus some\nawkward questions The construction of the scheme is not at all unique And\nLorentz invariance plays a strange, perhaps incredible role I am unable to prove, or even formulate clearly, the proposition that a sharp\nformulation of quantum field theory, such as that set out here, must disrespect\nserious Lorentz invariance But it seems to me that this is probably so As with\nrelativity before Einstein, there is then a preferred frame in the formulation of the\ntheory but it is experimentally indistinguishable It seems an eccentric way to\nmake a world 21\n\n\nBell further points out the legitimacy of a preferred reference frame in \"How to teach special\nrelativity\", where he advocates the approach of Lorentz and Poincaré 15\n\n\n89\n\n\nIn his long search for a unified theory, Einstein followed a belief in the underlying simplicity\nof physical phenomena He said \"If the answer is simple, God is talking # He also looked to\ngeometry as the source of this simplicity, believing that natural phenomena should be\ndescribable in geometric terms His early paper, \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving\nBodies, # showed that, in a space-time representation, electric and magnetic fields are exactly\nthe same Einstein took this unification as proof of space-time, and an essential step toward\na unified field theory Still, space-time geometry has not delivered such a theory In accordance with Einstein, it is now generally held that proper mathematical descriptions\nof relativistic systems should be \"manifestly covariant # That is, they should make no\nreference to any sort of preferred frame However, even in classical mechanics, this leads to\ndifficulties According to Dirac, we now know that \" 44 _the Hamiltonian form for the equations_\n\n\n#\n_of motion is all important_ (His italics ) On this representation of mechanics, Goldstein's\ngraduate text observes: 19\n\n\nAs with the Lagrangian picture in special relativity, two attitudes can be taken to the\nHamiltonian formulation of relativistic mechanics The first makes no pretense at a\ncovariant description but instead works in some specific Lorentz or inertial frame Time as measured in the particular Lorentz frame is then not treated on a common\nbasis with other coordinates but serves, as in nonrelativistic mechanics, as a\nparameter describing the evolution of the system Nonetheless, if the Lagrangian that\nleads to the Hamiltonian is itself based on a relativistically invariant physical theory,\ne g",
    "g , Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force, then the resultant Hamiltonian\npicture will be relativistically correct The second approach, of course, attempts a\nfully covariant description of the Hamiltonian picture, but the difficulties that\nplagued the corresponding Lagrangian approach are even fiercer here there seems to be a natural route available for constructing a relativistically\ncovariant Hamiltonian But the route turns out to be mined with booby traps Goldstein also shows that the preferred frame method easily gives a concise, non-covariant\nHamiltonian (Eq (5-16) in this paper) Applying Einstein's own dictum about the simple\nanswer, in this case it says that manifest covariance is _wrong_ As mentioned earlier, space-time suffers other drawbacks in comparison with the preferred\nframe approach One is its inconsistent treatments of linear and rotational motions Although\nforbidden for linear motion, a preferred frame defined by \"the fixed stars\" remains for the\nrotational case So, instead of a single reference frame, there are two very different types Again, an egregious shortcoming is that space-time by itself can't account for the direction\nof entropy Since its time dimension must be exchangeable with its spatial ones, time\n\n\n90\n\n\nnecessarily has a bidirectional character, with no favored direction * Another parameter, like\nthe unidirectional, independent time of the preferred frame approach, is required Thus\nMinkowski space-time avoids neither a preferred spatial frame, nor apparently an\nindependent time -- this despite its added geometric complexity In the present theory, Einstein's space-time view is abandoned However, several of his most\nbasic ideas remain: That the universe is fundamentally simple and describable in terms of\na special geometry His requirement of causality And the same relativistic principles are\nfollowed -- both Poincaré's principle of relativity, and Einstein's principle of equivalence Some other key ideas of this theory are these:\n\n\n1 ) Contrary to the prevailing view, transverse wave phenomena _can_ arise in\ncontinuous fluid media Where there are nonlinear wave structures,\n\ntransverse waves of interaction can arise _within_ the waves Such waves of\n\ninteraction are taken to represent electromagnetic ones 2 ) The unlimited velocity of matter waves is directly explainable on the basis\nof a repetitive four-dimensional wave structure Its geometry is Euclidean,\nand the waves are redundant in one dimension, 1 (Consequently, this\ndimension isn't obvious to observers ) When the wave movement parallels\n1, the apparent 3-D velocity is infinite 3",
    "3 ) The wave medium is an elastic fluid Hence its waves are acoustic and\nhave a characteristic 4-D velocity, c, under standard conditions Moving\nwave-based reflectors, aligned with the 1 axis, transform the waves\nrelativistically 4 ) The scalar potential can be exactly accounted for by flows in the 1\ndimension, from their refractive and reflective effects on matter waves 5 ) These flows are driven by flow waves, balanced such that net flows only\narise in the 1 dimension This preserves the relativistic character of the\nsystem, and also accounts for the vector potential This preserves the relativistic character of the\nsystem, and also accounts for the vector potential 6 6 ) Like other nonlinear waves, those of this system are self-organizing,\nforming additional patterns, called \"wavicles, # within the overall wave\nstructure These behave as elementary particles Involved are approximately\nhyperconical waves, reflected at a central \"core\" region where the amplitudes\nare great (Wavicles are also the above wave-based reflectors (Wavicles are also the above wave-based reflectors )\n\n\n*It's sometimes argued that this problem can be resolved by assuming that, when the time\ndimension of space-time is reversed, entropy is too The reversed case would be perceived\nas normal by observers, since their thought processes would run backwards also However,\nsince space-time is symmetrical, this still provides no basis for the acknowledged difference\nbetween the forward and reverse cases However,\nsince space-time is symmetrical, this still provides no basis for the acknowledged difference\nbetween the forward and reverse cases 91\n\n\n7",
    "91\n\n\n7 ) A wavicle's components are flow waves The resulting 1 flow pattern\ncorresponds to the electromagnetic potentials of a charged particle Noninverted and inverted patterns represent corresponding particles and\nantiparticles Quantized charge and energy result from a characteristic limit\nto the 1 flow attainable at the core Quantized charge and energy result from a characteristic limit\nto the 1 flow attainable at the core 8 8 ) Wavicles are inherently non-local phenomena, interdependent on other\nwavicles and their reflected waves for their existence Their behavior is that\n\nof extended objects, of arbitrary extent Like solitons, wavicles move and\ninteract as wholes Like solitons, wavicles move and\ninteract as wholes 9 9 ) The synchronous pulsation of a wavicle's standing wave field can be\ncharacterized in terms of \"Moiré wavefronts, # representing surfaces of equal\nphase These correspond to de Broglie waves, and define the quantum\nmechanical behavior of wavicles Nonlinear coupling of the pulsations, both\nwithin and between wavicles, is taken as the underlying mechanism Nonlinear coupling of the pulsations, both\nwithin and between wavicles, is taken as the underlying mechanism 10 ) In concentrations of matter, the average 1 flows of oppositely charged\nwavicles tend to cancel at large distances, like the electric fields of\nconventional charged particles The underlying waves do not cancel,\nhowever Consequently, intermittent flows arise, with an rms amplitude\nvarying, like the individual wave fields, as 1/r from the center of mass 2\n\nThese intermittent flows decrease the effective velocity of waves; i e , the\nvalue of c is locally reduced This slowing is taken as the basis of gravitation Since the 4-D velocity, c, determines the rate of all physical processes, these\nare observed to slow also, as in Einstein's general relativity In this case, the\ngravitational bending of light corresponds to ordinary refraction",
    "In this case, the\ngravitational bending of light corresponds to ordinary refraction 11 ) The wave medium, stuff, is assumed to have a fractal-like character, with\nadditional wave structures at much larger and smaller scales As in FPU\nrecurrence, wave energy can be gradually transferred up or down between\nscales, changing the effective temperature or density of stuff at those levels Because acoustic wave velocity depends on these parameters, c is also\nallowed to change over time (Again, this determines the rate of physical\nprocesses at the macroscopic scale ) An increasing c is proposed as the cause\nof the Hubble redshift seen in light from distant galaxies Until recently, the Hubble redshift has been taken as final proof of Einstein's general\nrelativity The effect was thought to be readily explained on the basis of a finite, expanding\nuniverse, allowed by a curved Minkowski space-time However, the original Big Bang\nmodel is contradicted now by a variety of observations An example cited previously is the\ndistance to the galaxy M100 measured by the Hubble Space Telescope Based on the\nstandard Big Bang model, this puts the age of the universe at about 8 billion years This is\nunder the estimated age of the oldest stars [38]\n\n\n92\n\n\nIt's also difficult to reconcile the Big Bang with the discovery of very-large-scale structures,\nsuch as the Great Wall or the Great Attractor Most importantly, there is the flatness\nproblem From the observed distribution of galaxies, the large-scale curvature of the\nuniverse is relatively small, or nonexistent Again, according to Linde, the discrepancy 37\n\nbetween the observed curvature and that predicted by general relativity and the Big Bang\nis roughly _sixty_ orders of magnitude Astronomical observation, once taken as confirmation\nof Einstein's general relativity, now speaks against it In contrast, the theory presented here allows a macroscopic universe older than its stars, with\nmature structures, and predicts an inherently flat geometry (In addition, it predicts new\nnonlinear wave effects, which may be verifiable through computer simulation ) There is also\nthe broad unification of physics, in a much simpler paradigm For the first time, relativity\nand quantum mechanics are joined Both the wave and particle aspects of elementary\nparticles find a single, coherent representation And there appears to be a truly unified\nphysical basis for the known natural forces Einstein argued that a preferred frame should not be hypothesized if it can't be identified\nexperimentally However, at least a very special case of linear motion is precisely defined\nby the cosmic microwave background This apparently corresponds to the overall system\nof celestial matter -- the same one Einstein took as the preferred frame for rotation Since\nthere presumably is some coupling between its different scales, it’s no less reasonable to take\nthis as the frame of our wave medium, stuff Physics has seen so little fundamental progress, for so long, it's often remarked that \"physics\nis dead # Is it proper, then, to continue taking our most fundamental physical assumptions\non _faith_ Shouldn't we have the courage to explore valid alternatives, such as the relativity\nof Lorentz and Poincaré, and the quantum mechanics of de Broglie, Bohm and Vigier To\nsolve a maze, sometimes it's necessary to double back and take a different path",
