    "# On-a-chip biosensing based on all-dielectric nanoresonators\n\n_Ozlem Yavas_ _[1]_ _, Mikael Svedendahl_ _[1]_ _, Paulina Dobosz_ _[1]_ _, Vanesa Sanz_ _[1]_ _, and Romain Quidant_ _[1,2

Avançats, 08010 Barcelona, Spain\n\n\nNanophotonics has become a key enabling technology in biomedicine with great promises in\n\n\nearly diagnosis and less invasive therapies In this context, the unique capability of plasmonic\n\n\nnoble metal nanoparticles to concentrate light on the nanometer scale has widely contributed\n\n\nto biosensing and enhanced spectroscopy Recently, high-refractive index dielectric\n\n\nnanostructures featuring low loss resonances have been proposed as a promising alternative\n\n\nto nanoplasmonics, potentially offering better sensing performances along with full\n\n\ncompatibility with the microelectronics industry In this letter we report the first\n\n\ndemonstration of biosensing with silicon nanoresonators integrated in state-of-the-art\n\n\nmicrofluidics Our lab-on-a-chip platform enables detecting Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n\n\ncancer marker in human serum with a sensitivity that meets clinical needs These\n\n\nperformances are directly compared with its plasmonic counterpart based on gold nanorods Our work opens new opportunities in the development of future point-of-care devices\n\n\ntowards a more personalized healthcare Keywords: lab-on-chip, all-dielectric nanoresonators, biosensing, cancer, silicon\n\n\nThe need for point-of-care devices in health and wellness monitoring is one of the principal\n\n\nmotivations behind the current development in biosensing Among the different available\n\n\ntransduction schemes, optical biosensors hold the advantage of being highly sensitive,\n\n\nenabling label free and cost effective real time sensing [1] Beyond silicon-based integrated\n\n\noptics [2–4] that shows great promises for sensing, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [5–8] and fiber\n\n\noptics [9,10] based sensors utilizing propagating evanescent waves have been extensively studied\n\n\nand validated on a wide range of analytes However, coupling incoming light to the surface\n\n\nmodes usually requires sophisticated optics and such sensors are often limited to large\n\n\nbioanalytes, owing to a substantial spatial mismatch of the sensing mode with the tiniest\n\n\nmolecules These limitations can partially be overcome by using 3D nano-optical resonators In\n\n\nparticular, extensive efforts have been put on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)\n\n\nsensors [11–13] which exploit the unique properties of noble metal nanoantennas The ability to\n\n\nexcite LSPR with freely propagating incident light considerably simplifies the optical setup\n\n\nneeded for such label free measurements Highly confined modes also provide strong overlap\n\n\nbetween the electromagnetic field on the surface and the relevant biological analyte\n\n\ndimensions Finally, the tiny size of each nanosensors enable their assembly in small foot\n\n\nprint sensing areas compatible with parallel multi-detection platforms [11–13] However,\n\n\nplasmonic nanoparticles suffer from dissipative losses in the metal that lead to broad\n\n\nresonances that eventually limit the sensitivity of the sensor read-out Recently, high\n\n\nrefractive index dielectric nanoparticles have been proposed as an attractive alternative to\n\n\nplasmonic nanoparticles in wide range of applications [14,15]\n\n\nAll-dielectric nanophotonics is a fast progressing field which enables manipulation of both\n\n\nelectric and magnetic components of the incoming light These unique properties open up\n\n\nnew opportunities in the field of metamaterials including negative refractive index, cloaking,\n\n\nsuperlensing and many more [15–20] In practice, light coupling to dielectric subwavelength\n\n\nparticles results in the excitation of both magnetic and electric multipole resonances which\n\n\ntranslates into multiple peaks in their extinction spectrum Similar to metallic nanoparticles,\n\n\nthe resonance frequencies depend on their geometry, constitutive material and the dielectric\n\n\nenvironment Their sensitivity to the surrounding dielectric permittivity along with their\n\n\nstrong mode localization suggests high index dielectric nanoparticles could perform well as\n\n\nbiosensing transducers [14,21–23] Silicon nanoresonators, with resonances in visible-NIR spectral\n\n\nrange, were first studied theoretically and more recently measured experimentally [24–28] The\n\n\nuse of silicon is motivated by its compatibility with the microelectronics industry, high\n\n\nmaterial abundance and low cost While it has recently been suggested that Si nanoresonators\n\n\ncould benefit to the detection of biological molecules, so far, only bulk refractive index\n\n\nsensing measurements have been reported [21–23]\n\n\nIn this letter, we demonstrate that Si nanoresonator arrays integrated with state-of-the-art\n\n\nmicrofluidics result in an efficient sensing platform for the detection of protein cancer\n\n\nmarkers in human serum, at clinically relevant concentrations for cancer screening We first\n\n\nstudy the optimal structural design of Si nanodisks for molecular sensing Then, we\n\n\ndemonstrate detection of PSA (prostate specific antigen) in buffer with a limit of detection\n\n\n(LOD) that is comparable to gold standard immunoassay techniques Finally, to validate its\n\n\noperation in clinical conditions, the platform is tested in human serum Our platform consists of silicon nanodisk arrays on a quartz substrate integrated with a\n\n\nPDMS microfluidic chip including micromechanical valves (Fig",
    "Our platform consists of silicon nanodisk arrays on a quartz substrate integrated with a\n\n\nPDMS microfluidic chip including micromechanical valves (Fig 1a-c) 1a-c) We fabricate the\n\n\nsilicon nanodisk arrays using standard negative resist e-beam lithography followed by a\n\n\nreactive ion etching step on commercial silicon coated quartz samples (see the Supplementary\n\n\nInformation) The nanodisk arrays have a fixed height _h_ =50 nm We choose to tune the disk\n\n\nradius _r_ and inter-particle distance _s_ to assess the optimum nanosensor parameters The\n\n\nextinction spectra of the nanodisk arrays are measured using a homemade transmission\n\n\nmicroscopy set-up integrated with a VIS-NIR light source coupled to a spectrometer [29] Our\n\n\noptical detection enables us to interrogate up to 32 regions in parallel throughout the chip for\n\n\nreal-time resonance tracking of different sensor arrays The PDMS chip is fabricated by multilayer soft lithography leading to 8 sensing channels\n\n\nthat are all individually and simultaneously addressable (see the Supplementary\n\n\nInformation) [29] The sample flow on the experiment channels is controlled by the\n\n\nmicromechanical valves [30] that are thin PDMS membranes between the flow layer and the\n\n\ncontrol layer of the chip By pressurizing the control channels, the thin PDMS membrane\n\n\nvalve is actuated to control the flow of the samples on the experiment layer These\n\n\nmicromechanical valves are pressure-driven by electronic valves that are controlled by a\n\n\nhome-made graphical user interface The detection of the biomolecules is based on a standard sandwich assay scheme where the\n\n\nprotein of interest is captured between two specific antibodies, one immobilized on the\n\n\nsilicon surface, acting as capture antibody and another that is flowed in solution as detection\n\n\nantibody (Fig",
    "The detection of the biomolecules is based on a standard sandwich assay scheme where the\n\n\nprotein of interest is captured between two specific antibodies, one immobilized on the\n\n\nsilicon surface, acting as capture antibody and another that is flowed in solution as detection\n\n\nantibody (Fig 1d) The capture antibody is immobilized on the silicon sensors by passive\n\n\nadsorption similarly to ELISA and other immunoassay techniques [31] The samples, which\n\n\ncontain different concentrations of the target protein of interest, are then introduced into\n\n\nindividual channels and the protein is captured by the immobilized antibody Finally, the\n\n\ndetection antibody is introduced and is bound to the previously captured protein This\n\n\namplification step provides higher resonance shifts compared to the shifts obtained by the\n\n\ntarget proteins, offering higher concentration resolution for small proteins It also increases\n\n\nthe selectivity of the sensing protocol since the protein of interest is recognized by two\n\n\nspecific antibodies (see the Supplementary Information) The increased effective refractive\n\n\nindex at the sensor vicinity resulting from the binding steps (Fig 1d) causes the resonances of\n\n\nthe nanodisk arrays to redshift enabling accurate monitoring of the adsorption and binding\n\n\nkinetics of the molecules (Fig 1e) d\n\n\ni\n\n\nii\n\n\niii\n\n\n\n|(Fig 1e) <br>b c<br>e<br>500 μm<br>3<br>[PSA] (nm)<br>100 ng/ml<br>0 ng/ml<br>Shift<br>2<br>Resonance<br>i<br>1<br>0|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)||||\n|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)|Si<br>quartz|||\n|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)|500 nm<br>|||\n|(Fig 1e) <br>b<br>c<br>e<br>i<br>[PSA]<br>500 μm<br><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml<br>Resonance Shift (nm)|i<br>[PSA]<br><br> 100 ng/ml<br> 0 ng/ml||||\n|(Fig 1e)",

    "5 The analytical parameters of\n\n\n\nthe sandwich assay on both sensors can be found in Supplementary Table 1 The LOD (IC 10 )\n\n\nof the gold sensors is found to be around 0 87 ng/ml which is slightly higher than the LOD of\n\n\nthe silicon based sensors Conversely, the dynamic range of the LSPR-based sensors is\n\n\nbroader for higher concentrations, giving a lower slope, which leads to higher limit of\n\n\nquantification Besides, the assay time was much shorter for silicon based sensors since the\n\n\nLSPR sensing protocol requires self-assembled monolayer preparation and activation as well\n\n\nas blocking steps using ethanolamine (Supplementary Fig Besides, the assay time was much shorter for silicon based sensors since the\n\n\nLSPR sensing protocol requires self-assembled monolayer preparation and activation as well\n\n\nas blocking steps using ethanolamine (Supplementary Fig 4) 1 0\n\n\n0 8\n\n\n\n0 6\n\n\n0 4\n\n\n0 2\n\n\n0 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 1 1 10 100 1,000\n\n\n[PSA] (ng/ml)\n\n\n**Figure 5:** Comparison of the Si and Au platforms PSA calibration curves for gold nanorod\n\n\narrays (gold) and silicon nanodisk arrays (purple) Both curves were normalized for clearer\n\n\ncomparison The error bars represent the standard deviation of 2 parallel measurements on the\n\n\nsame chip The shaded areas are the respective dynamic ranges The inset shows the\n\n\nexperimental extinction spectra of gold nanorod arrays and silicon nanodisk arrays We have studied the use of silicon nanoresonators integrated in a state-of-the-art\n\n\nmicrofluidic architecture for biosensing We demonstrated that the resulting platform is\n\n\ncompatible with detection of small biomolecules in complex matrices for clinical\n\n\napplications The reported sensing performance enables us to detect clinically relevant\n\n\nconcentrations of PSA We have also compared our platform with a well-developed LSPR-based sensing protocol\n\n\nand shown that the sensitivity, LOD and the dynamic ranges are comparable Besides the\n\n\nsimilar sensing performance, one of the advantages of the silicon based sensors is the\n\n\nsignificantly longer decay length of the surface field over LSPR modes in metal\n\n\nnanoantennas (Supplementary Fig 1), which can be beneficial for multilayer assays\n\n\ninvolving detection of molecules relatively far from the surface This suggests that in\n\n\ncomparison with LSPR sensors, different assay types with multiple layers of antibodies can\n\n\nbe efficiently monitored using the silicon nanoresonators which in practice enables more\n\n\npractical and faster detection of the target analyte The extinction of the Si nanoresonators considered here is much lower compared to the\n\n\nextinction of the gold nanoantennas (inset Fig 5)",
    "5) This suggests that for Si resonators there is\n\n\nstill room for improvement by tailoring the shape, size, periodicity and height of\n\n\nnanoresonator arrays in order to obtain sharper, stronger and potentially more sensitive\n\n\nresonances We thus foresee further engineering of the Si nanoresonators including\n\n\narrangement in dimers and oligomers, that could improve the sensing performance However,\n\n\nmore complex nanostructuring of the silicon might also affect the local sensitivity to\n\n\nmolecular adsorption at the surface of the nanoresonators While the location of the adsorbed\n\n\nantibodies is not controlled in the present study (see Supplementary Fig While the location of the adsorbed\n\n\nantibodies is not controlled in the present study (see Supplementary Fig 5 for a simulation of\n\n\nthe comparison of various cases), this parameter can become important when studying more\n\n\ncomplicated designs Finally, the quality of the sandwich assay, hence the LOD and sensitivity, can further be\n\n\nimproved by additional optimizations of the capture and detection antibody concentrations ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n\n\nSupporting Information\n\n\nSensor fabrication, Microfluidic chip fabrication, Measurements, Sandwich assay formation\n\n\non chip, Simulations, Supplementary Figures, Supplementary Table AUTHOR INFORMATION\n\n\n**Corresponding Author**\n\n\nRomain Quidant, romain quidant@icfo es\n\n\n**Author Contributions**\n\n\nR Q proposed the idea and co-supervised the work with V S O Y Y designed the silicon\n\n\nsensor arrays and fabricated the on-chip devices, carried out the measurements and processed\n\n\nthe data M S S carried out the FEM simulations and interpreted the resonance modes carried out the FEM simulations and interpreted the resonance modes P D and\n\n\nV S supervised the sandwich assay chemistry All authors analyzed the data and contributed\n\n\nto the writing of the manuscript **Notes**\n\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interests ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nT                                    S\n\n\nP          Q  M           P\n\n\nS    M                          ‘S   O   P\n\n\nfor Centres of Excellence in R&D (SEV-2015-0522) and grant FIS2013-46141-P and\n\n\nSwedish Research Council (637-2014-6894) REFERENCES\n\n\n(1) Long, F ;
