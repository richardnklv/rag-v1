    "B Implementation of the GM-UKF\n\n\nThe flowchart of the proposed GM-UKF is shown in Fig 1 It consists of four major steps, namely a batch-mode\nregression form step, a robust pre-whitening step, a robust\nregression and robust error covariance matrix updating steps Specifically, after state initialization and the application of\nstatistical linearization to the nonlinear system process model,\nwe calculate the predicted state and its associated covariance\nmatrix Next, applying statistical linearization to the nonlinear\nobservation function around the predicted state, we derive the\nexpression of the predicted measurement and its covariance\nmatrix Then, by processing the observations and predictions\nsimultaneously, we obtain the batch-mode regression form Next, we apply the PS to a matrix that consists of two-time\nsequence of the predicted state and innovation vectors to detect\nthe presence of any observation and innovation outliers This\nin turn allows us to carry out a robust prewhitening of the\nregression model To suppress outliers and filter out thicktailed non-Gaussian measurement noise, the GM-estimator\nis used and solved by means of the Iteratively Reweighted\nLeast Squares (IRLS) algorithm Finally, the total influence\nfunction of our GM-UKF is derived and utilized to derive the\n\nasymptotic state estimation error covariance matrix Note that\nduring the iterative solution of the GM-UKF, we advocate to\nuse the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimation for the first\niteration and then switch to the IRLS algorithm By doing so\nwe improve the convergence speed of that algorithm Remark Corollary 3 1 in Part I of the two-part series\nstates that the matrix Z roughly follows a bivariate Gaussian\ndistribution Using that property, we carry out extensive Monte\nCarlo simulations and QQ-plots to determine the probability\ndistribution of the PS From Fig 3 in Part I, we infer that they\n\n\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS, VOL , NO , 2017 3\n\n\n\napproximately obey a chi-squares distribution with 2-degrees\nof freedom Consequently, we set the outlier detection threshold of the statistical test applied to the PS to η = χ [2] 2,0 975\nat a significance level of 97 5%",
    "5% The detailed implementation\nprocedures of the PS algorithm are presented in Appendix A C Tuning the Parameters of the GM-UKF\n\n\nThe tuning of the GM-UKF involves the settings of the\nbreakpoint λ of the Huber ρ-function, the parameter d of\nthe weighting function, and the convergence tolerance of the\nIRLS algorithm λ determines the trade-off that we wish to\nachieve between a least-squares and a least-absolute-value fit Indeed, when λ → 0, the Huber ρ-function tends to the\nleast-absolute-value ρ-function and when λ →∞, it tends\nto the least-squares ρ-function Regarding the parameter d, it\ndetermines the statistical efficiency of the PS at the assumed\nprobability distribution along with the robustness of the GMestimator [9] Decreasing this parameter too much shrinks\nthe dimensions of the 97 5% confidence ellipse As a result,\ngood measurements may be unduly downweighted, which\nyields a decrease in the statistical efficiency On the other\nhand, increasing d will increase the bias of the GM-estimator Extensive simulations have shown that the parameters λ and\nd can be set to 1 5 to achieve a good statistical efficiency\nat the Gaussian, the Laplacian, and the Cauchy distributions\nwhile achieving a good robustness to outliers Regarding the\nconvergence tolerance threshold of the IRLS algorithm, a\ntypical value is 0 01; decreasing this value results in small\nincremental changes of the state estimates while increasing\nthe computing time of the algorithm Proposition 1 The coefficient of the estimation error covari\nE Φ [ ψ [2] (r S ) ]\nance matrix of our GM-UKF expressed as {E Φ [ψ [′] (r S )]} [2] [ is]\nequal to 1 0369 for the Huber cost function with λ=1 5 Proof See the proof in Appendix B III",

    "A Case 1: Thick-tailed Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise\n\nwithout Outliers\n\n\nIn this section, we first evaluate the performance of the GMIEKF, the UKF, and the GM-UKF under normal conditions Specifically, a zero mean Gaussian noise with a standard\ndeviation of 10 [−][2] is added to the voltage angles; the noise of\nthe voltage magnitudes follows a bimodal Gaussian mixture\nwith zero mean, variances of 10 [−][4] and 10 [−][3] and weights of\n0 9 and 0 1, respectively; Laplace noise with zero mean and\nscale 0 2 is added to the real and reactive power injections\nmeasurements The test results are displayed in Fig 2 It is\nobserved that the UKF is not able to cope with Laplacian noise\neven in the absence of outliers By contrast, the GM-IEKF and\nthe GM-UKF can filter out such a noise while achieving good\ntracking performance However, the GM-IEKF has much lower\nrelative statistical efficiency with respect to our GM-UKF In\nparticular, the GM-IEKF poorly estimates the field voltage\nand the rotor speed By observing Fig By observing Fig 2, it is interesting to\nnote that the turbine mechanical power is changing during the\ntransient process According to the CIGRE report [10], it can\nsignificantly vary when control features such as fast valving\nor special protection schemes are used to limit the output of\nthe steam driven generator during transients Consequently, it\nis of vital importance to not assume it to be fixed at a constant\nsteady-state value as commonly done in most of the literature,\nbut to obtain accurate dynamic state variables of the governor\nfor controls and stability analysis",
