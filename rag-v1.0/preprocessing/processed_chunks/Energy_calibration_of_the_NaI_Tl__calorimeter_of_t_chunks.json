    "## Energy calibration of the NaI(Tl) calorimeter e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] events of the SND detector using\n\n### M N Achasov, [1] D A Bukin, T V Dimova, V P Druzhinin, V B Golubev, V N Ivanchenko, A A Korol\n\nInstitute of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russia\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nCalibration of the three layer NaI(Tl) spherical calorimeter of the SND detector using electron – positron scattering events is described Energy resolution of\n5%(FWHM/2 36) for 500 MeV photons was achieved 1 Introduction\n\n\nThe SND is a general purpose nonmagnetic detector ( Fig 1 ) operating at\nVEPP-2M e [+] e [−] collider in BINP ( Novosibirsk ) in the center of mass energy\nrange of 0 2 ÷ 1 4 GeV [1,2] Experimental studies include decays of ρ, ω, φ\nmesons and nonresonance hadron production at low energies Good energy\nresolution for photons in a wide energy range from 30 to 700 MeV is essential for suppression of background in reconstruction of intermediate π [0] and\nη mesons and detection of photons emitted in radiative transitions between\ndifferent quarkonium states Fast preliminary calibration of the calorimeter\nis based on cosmic muons [3] It provides reasonable energy resolution of\n5 5%(FWHM/2 36) for 500 MeV photons, but to increase resolution to its\nhighest value it is necessary to use experimental events with precisely known\nenergies of final particles In addition, such a process should have clear event\ntopology, be well separated from background, and have large cross section Potentially suitable processes are e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−], e [+] e [−] → γγ, e [+] e [−] → π [+] π [−], e [+] e [−] →\nµ [+] µ [−], but given the VEPP-2M luminosity of 3 · 10 [30] cm [−][2] s [−][1] at 1 GeV, only\ne [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] produces enough statistics for calibration of the calorimeter in\na reasonably short time 1 E-mail: achasov@inp nsk su, FAX: +7(383-2)35-21-63\n\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\n\n2 The SND calorimeter\n\n\nSND detector [1] ( Fig 1) consists of a cylindrical drift chamber, calorimeter,\nand muon system The three-layer NaI(Tl) spherical calorimeter, consisting\nof 1632 individual counters ( Fig 2) is a main part of the detector It was\ndescribed in [3], so let us mention only some details necessary for description\nof the calibration procedure Calorimeter solid angle coverage in a spherical coordinate system with Z axis\ndirected along the electron beam is 18 [◦] ≤ θ ≤ 162 [◦] and 0 [◦] ≤ φ ≤ 360 [◦] Calorimeter is logically divided into two parts: “small” angles 18 [◦] ≤ θ ≤ 36 [◦]\n\nand 144 [◦] ≤ θ ≤ 162 [◦], and “large” angles: 36 [◦] ≤ θ ≤ 144 [◦] The angular dimensions of crystals at “large” angles are ∆φ = ∆θ = 9 [◦] and ∆φ = 18 [◦], ∆θ = 9 [◦]\n\nat “small” angles The calorimeter layers are enumerated starting from the\ninteraction point – the first one is the nearest to the beam The calorimeter energy resolutions for 500 MeV electrons, photons, and muons\nafter primary calibration using cosmic muons are shown in the Table 1 While\npeak positions in Monte Carlo simulation and experiment agree at a 1% level,\nexperimental resolutions are significantly worse than simulated ones The possible explanations of the differences in simulated and experimental spectra\ncould be attributed to instability of the detector electronics, systematic errors in the cosmic calibration procedure, and inadequate treatment of nonuniformity of light collection efficiency over the crystal volume in Monte Carlo\nsimulation Relative stability of calibration constants in time [3], shows that electronics\nand photodetectors instabilities do not contribute much into experimental\nresolutions To eliminate systematic biases of cosmic calibration procedure,\nthe OFF-LINE calibration based on e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] events was performed 3 The calibration method The calibration constants based on e [+] e [−] scattering events could be obtained\nby minimization of the expression:\n\n\n\nF (C i ) = �\n\n\n\n( �\nj i\n\n\n\nU ij - C i − E 0 ) [2], (1)\n\ni\n\n\n\nwhere j – event number, i – crystal number, U ij is an energy deposition in\nith crystal and jth event, E 0 – beam energy, C i – calibration constant for ith\ncrystal Similar calibration procedure was implemented in CLEO II detector\n\n\n2\n\n\n[4], but layered structure of the SND calorimeter complicates the task due to\nlarge fluctuations of energy depositions in the calorimeter layers and energy\ndependence of longitudinal development of electromagnetic shower",
    "Similar calibration procedure was implemented in CLEO II detector\n\n\n2\n\n\n[4], but layered structure of the SND calorimeter complicates the task due to\nlarge fluctuations of energy depositions in the calorimeter layers and energy\ndependence of longitudinal development of electromagnetic shower Although\nr m s s of the energy deposition spectra in an individual crystals are about\n100%, the statistical accuracy of C i must be high, due to strong correlations\nbetween energy depositions in different crystals in an event The drawbacks of\nsuch a direct method are that the calibration constants are dependent on the\nenergy of the electrons and produce biased values of average energy depositions\nin calorimeter layers To avoid such complications the SND calorimeter calibration is based on comparison of coefficients C i [mc] and C i [exp], obtained using simulated and experimental electrons of the same energy After cosmic calibration the measured energy deposition in ith crystal U i can\nbe written as U i = ǫ i - E i, where E i is an actual energy deposition and difference\nof ǫ i from unity, characterizes the systematic shift of cosmic calibration for\nith crystal To compensate for this shift it is necessary to find corresponding\ncorrection coefficient C i [cal] = 1/ǫ i These calibration constants are obtained in\nthe following way First, the functions:\n\n\n\nC [exp] i U ij − E 0 ) [2],(2)\n\ni\n\n\n\n( �\nj i\n\n\n\n( �\nj i\n\n\n\nF (C i [mc] [) =] �\n\n\n\nC i [mc] [E] [ij] [−] [E] [0] [)] [2] and F(C i [exp] ) = �\ni\n\n\n\nare minimized over C i [mc] and C i [exp] Here i is a crystal number, j – event number\nE ij – energy depositions in crystals in Monte Carlo simulation, U ij – measured\nenergy depositions in experimental e [+] e [−] events, E 0 – beam energy ( the same\nin experimental and simulated events ) The minimums of the functions are\ndetermined by the following conditions:\n\n\n∂F (C i )/∂C i = 0 (3)\n\n\n\nCoefficients C i [exp] and C i [mc] are the solutions of the set of simultaneous linear\nequations of the form A · c = b, where A is an n × n matrix and its elements\nare A im = [�] [E] [E] [ or] [ �] [U] [U] [,][ c][ and][ b][ are vectors of a dimension][ n][ with]\n\n\n\nj [U] [ij] [U] [mj] [,][ c][ and][ b][ are vectors of a dimension][ n][ with]\n\n\n\nj [E] [ij] [E] [mj] [ or] [ �] j\n\n\n\nelements c i = C i [mc] or C i [exp] and b i = E 0 �\n\n\n\nj [U] [ij] [ Here][ n][ = 1680 is a]\n\n\n\nj [E] [ij] [ or][ E] [0] � j\n\n\n\ntotal number of crystals in calorimeter, indices i and m - crystals numbers, j the event number The solutions of the two linear systems satisfy the following\ncondition C i [exp] = C i [mc] [/ǫ] [i] [, hence][ C] i [cal] = C i [exp] /C i [mc] [ ]\n\n\nThe calibration constants C i [cal] obtained this way have high statistical accuracy,\nare independent of the energy of electrons, and do not produce biases in energy\ndepositions in calorimeter layers 3\n\n\nFor calorimeter calibration e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] events were simulated In order to\n\nsave simulation time, angular distribution was set to uniform over the solid\nangle The passage of electrons through the detector was simulated by means\nof the UNIMOD2 code [5] Both experimental and simulated e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] events are selected according\nto the same criteria: only two particles must be detected, the total energy\ndeposition in the calorimeter is greater than 1 2 · E 0 and acollinearity angle\nis less than 10 degrees All crystals with energy depositions less than 5 MeV\nare discarded Remaining crystals are put into calculation of the elements of\nmatrix A and vector b When events processing is finished, the linear system is\nsolved using SLAP2 [6] package, i e C i [exp] and C i [mc] are obtained for all crystals\nand then C i [cal] are calculated 4 Events processing results This calibration procedure was used in the OFF-LINE processing of the data\ncollected in 1996 ÷ 1997 in the center of mass energy range 0 99 ÷ 1 04 GeV\n\n[1] To obtain C i [mc] [, 50000 simulated events with 500 MeV electrons were processed,]\ncorresponding to about 150 electrons per crystal The mean ⟨C [mc] ⟩ and their\nr m s",
    "s values σ [mc] are listed in the Table 2 In principle, the coefficients may\ndepend on the electron energy, layer number, and crystal size But at this level\nof statistics no significant difference in C i [mc] values for different crystal sizes\nin the “large” angle part is seen The statistical accuracy σ C [mc] of C i [mc] can be\nestimated as σ C [mc] [=][ σ] [mc] [/][⟨][C] [mc] [⟩] [( Table 2 ) ]\n\n\nTo obtain C i [exp] constants, e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] events corresponding to integrated\nluminosity about 130 nb [−][1] are needed Such sample contains about 240000\nelectrons in the “large” angles part, corresponding to at least 150 electrons per\ncrystal On average, the SND acquires such an integrated luminosity in three\ndays of VEPP-2M operation On average, the SND acquires such an integrated luminosity in three\ndays of VEPP-2M operation The mean ⟨C [exp] ⟩, their r m s values σ [exp] and statistical accuracy of C i [exp] (σ C [exp] [) are listed in the Table 2 together with the mean]\n⟨C [cal] ⟩, their r m s values σ [cal] and statistical errors σ C [cal] [=] � (σ C [exp] [)] [2] [ + (][σ] C [mc] [)] [2] [ ]\n\n\nThe statistical accuracy of calibration constants for the first two layers is satisfactory, but for the third layer it is larger than that for cosmic calibration\n\n[3] This is due to relatively small energy deposition of electromagnetic showers in the third layer, combined with large number of hit crystals Thus the\ninfluence of the accuracy of calibration constants in the third layer on an overall calorimeter resolution for electrons and photons is small The situation is\ndifferent for muons and charged pions, where relative energy deposition in crys\n\n4\n\n\ntals of the third layer is large In this case high statistical error in calibration\ncoefficients significantly increases the widths of energy deposition spectra So,\ninstead of C i [cal] [, the coefficients obtained during cosmic calibration were used]\nfor the third layer The r m s difference σ [sys] in calibration coefficients obtained using cosmic and\ne [+] e [−] calibration procedures can be estimated as σ [sys] = � (σ [exp] ) [2] − (σ C [exp] [)] [2] [ ]\n\nThis value is about 4% for the first two layers and is less than 5% for the third\nlayer 5 Energy resolution of the calorimeter Implementation of the calibration procedure\n\n\nAs a result of e [+] e [−] calibration the calorimeter energy resolutions for 500 MeV\nelectrons and photons ( Table 1, Fig 3 ) were improved by 10%, but still remain\nworse than those expected from Monte Carlo simulation A Monte Carlo simulation of energy deposition was first carried out with a\nuniform description of the nonuniformity of the light collection efficiency over\nthe crystal volume Then, calculations taking into account nonuniform “direct”\nlight from a scintillation and diffuse reflection from the crystal boundaries and\nwrapping were performed The energy deposition U in crystal measured in\nexperiment is\n\n\nU(MeV) = C(MeV/pC) · e · ν · ζ(1/MeV) · ψ · E(MeV), (4)\n\n\nwhere E is an energy deposition in the scintillation counter, C – ratio between\nthe collected electric charge from photodetector, measured in pC, and energy\ndeposition in the units of MeV, ν - quantum efficiency of the photodetector\nmultiplied by its gain, ζ - light yield of the scintillator, ψ - light collection\nefficiency, e - electron charge In general, ψ is a function of coordinates within\nthe crystal and depends on reflection coefficient on the crystal boundaries and\nphotocathode diameter To take into account the nonuniformity of light collection efficiency, the crystal response was simulated taking into account a uniform light collection due\nto diffuse reflection and nonuniform “direct” light collection, depending on\na solid angle of a photocathode, visible from a scintillation point The results of such simulation the energy distribution width for 500 MeV photons\nis 4 2%(FWHM/2 36) ( Fig 4 ) The experimental spectrum is shown in the\nsame figure Calorimeter resolutions for other types of particles are also shown\nin Table 1 The agreement between experiment and simulation became much\n\n\n5\n\n\nbetter and the residual disagreement could be attributed to difference in diffuse reflection coefficients values in different crystals To study the calorimeter response for photons as a function of photon energy,\nthe events e [+] e [−] → γγ and e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] γ were used The kinematic fit of the\ne [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] γ events was performed taking into account energy–momentum\nconservation and the reconstructed photon energies E rec [γ] [were obtained These]\nvalues were compared with direct calorimeter measurements One could expect\nstrong correlation between these values, but study of the simulated e [+] e [−] →\ne [+] e [−] γ events, where the energy of the photon is precisely known, showed, that\neven for photons in the energy range from 30 up to 150 MeV these correlation\ndo not change significantly the calorimeter response The energy range above\n170 MeV was also studied using 2γ annihilation events and results agree well\nwith those for e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] γ reaction The dependence of calorimeter energy\nresolution on photon energies ( Fig 5 ) was fitted as\n\n\n\n4 2%\nσ E /E(%) =\n\n\n\n(5)\nE(GeV)\n\n\n\n\n[�] 4\n\n\n\nAfter calorimeter calibration with e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] events, the photon energies\nturned out to be biased by about 1% ( Table 1, Fig 4 ) In oder to compensate\nthis bias, the calibration coefficients for photons were corrected accordingly The distributions over two-photon invariant masses m γγ in φ → ηγ and K s →\nπ [0] π [0] decays after such correction are shown at Fig 6 and 7 Peaks at π [0] and\nη mesons masses are clearly seen Relative drift of calibration coefficients is shown in Fig",
    "Relative drift of calibration coefficients is shown in Fig 8 8 It can be seen,\nthat for a time period between consecutive calibrations, the mean shift of the\ncoefficients is about 1% and r It can be seen,\nthat for a time period between consecutive calibrations, the mean shift of the\ncoefficients is about 1% and r m s of their random spread is about 2 5% for\nthe first two layers and about 5% for the third layer 6 Conclusion\n\n\nUsing the described procedure for the SND calorimeter calibration the statistical accuracy of 2% in calibration constants for the first two layers was\nachieved The final resolution for photons varies from 10% at 50 MeV to 5%\nat 500 MeV References\n\n\n6\n\n\n[1] M N Achasov, et al , First physical results of SND detector at VEPP-2M,\nNovosibirsk, Budker INP 96-47, 1996 [2] V M Aulchenko et al , The 6th International Conference on Hadron\nSpectroscopy, Manchester, UK, 10th-14th July 1995, p , The 6th International Conference on Hadron\nSpectroscopy, Manchester, UK, 10th-14th July 1995, p 295 [3] M N Achasov, et al , Nucl Instr Instr and Meth and Meth A401(1997), p 179\n\n\n[4] Y Kubota et al , Nucl Instr Instr and Meth and Meth A320(1992), p 66 [5] A D Bukin, et al Bukin, et al , in Proceedings of Workshop on Detector and Event\nSimulation in High Energy Physics, The Netherlands, Amsterdam, 8-12 April\n1991, NIKHEF, p 79 [6] Mark K Seager, A SLAP for Masses, Preprint UCRL-100195, Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory, 1988 7\n\n\nTable 1\n\nCalorimeter response for 500 MeV electrons, photons and muons E 0 = 500 MeV —\nenergy of the particles, E [e,γ,µ] — measured energies in the calorimeter for electrons,\nphotons and energy deposition for muons respectively, σ — FWHM/2 36 of distribution over E/E 0, Peak — the peak position in the distribution over E/E 0 EXP1\nand EXP2 — experimental distributions after cosmic and e [+] e [−] calibrations respectively MC1 and MC2 — distributions in Monte Carlo simulation without and\nwith nonuniformity of light collection over crystal volume was taken into account\nrespectively EXP1 EXP2 MC1 MC2\n\n\nPeak σ(%) Peak σ(%) Peak σ(%) Peak σ(%)\n\n\nE [e] /E 0 0 99 5 4 1 4 7 0 99 3 5 1 4 2\n\n\nE [γ] /E 0 1 5 4 1 01 5 0 1 3 7 0 99 4 2\n\n\nE [µ] /E 0 0 33 8 0 33 8 0 33 5 0 34 7\n\n\nTable 2\nC [mc], C [exp], C [cal] coefficients and their statistical accuracy in calorimeter layers for\ncrystals at the ”large” angle zone\n\nlayer number ⟨C [mc] ⟩ σ [mc] σ C [mc] [(%)] ⟨C [exp] ⟩ σ [exp] σ C [exp] [(%)] ⟨C [cal] ⟩ σ [cal] σ C [cal] [(%)]\n\n\nI 1 04 0 02 1 9 1 07 0 04 1 5 1 03 0 04 2 3\n\n\nII 1 05 0 02 1 8 1 05 0 04 1 5 1 0 04 2 3\n\n\nIII 1 29 0 06 5 1 27 0 07 4 0 98 0 08 6 4\n\n\n8\n\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 cm\n\n\nFig 1 SND detector, section along the beams; 1 — beam pipe, 2 — drift chambers,\n3 — scintillation counters, 4 — light guides, 5 — PMTs, 6 — NaI(Tl) crystals, 7 —\nvacuum phototriodes, 8 — iron absorber, 9 — streamer tubes, 10 — 1cm iron plates,\n11 — scintillation counters, 12 and 13 — elements of collider magnetic system Fig 2 NaI(Tl) crystals layout inside the calorimeter: 1 — NaI(Tl) crystals, 2 —\nphotodetectors ( vacuum phototriodes ), 3 — aluminum supporting hemispheres 9\n\n\nFig 3 Energy spectra for 500 MeV electrons; E 0 = 500 MeV - beam energy, E measured energy EXP2 - distribution after e [+] e [−] calibration, EXP1 - distribution\nafter cosmic calibration _8000_\n\n\n_6000_\n\n\n_4000_\n\n\n_2000_\n\n\n\n_0_\n\n_0 6_ _0 8_ _1_ _1 2_ _1 4_\n\n_E_ _/E_\nγ _0_\n\n\n\nFig 4 Energy spectra for 500 MeV photons E 0 = 500 MeV - beam energy, E γ measured energy 10\n\n\nFig 5 Dependence of the calorimeter energy resolution on the photon energy E - photon energy, σ E /E - energy resolution of the calorimeter obtained using\ne [+] e [−] → γγ ( dots ) and e [+] e [−] → e [+] e [−] γ ( circles )reactions The error bars show\nonly statistical errors Fig 6 Two photon invariant mass distribution in the experimental φ → K S K L,\nK S → π [0] π [0] events Line - asymmetric Gaussian fit Line - asymmetric Gaussian fit 11\n\n\nFig 7 Two photon invariant mass distribution in experimental φ → ηγ events Line\n\n- asymmetric Gaussian fit Line\n\n- asymmetric Gaussian fit Fig 8 The calibration coefficients spread Points — average ratio of a current calibration result to the preceding one, error bars — FWHM/2 36 of the distributions\nof these ratios over the whole calorimeter layer Horizontal axis shows the time\nelapsed from the first calibration Shown are the results for the second calorimeter\nlayer Other layers behave similarly Other layers behave similarly 12"
