    "# Restoration of the Past and Three Principles of Time\n\n#### Alexandr K Guts\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Omsk State University\n644077 Omsk-77 RUSSIA\n\n\nE-mail: guts@univer omsk su\n\n\nMarch 5, 1997\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nCan the Past be restored Poincar´e and Costa de Beauregard showed that the past\nis not restored statistically This follows from Bayes formula It is mith that history\ncan make this and moreover that history is created for this Historian is sure that he is\nfree for such work In this mithological world one are living not only historians but all\npeople The fear of death is a cause of such confidence In this note three Principles of\nTime will be formulated which say that historians can not give us the truth text-book\nof History of any society Can a reseacher restore the events of the past epoches without distortion It\nis mith that history can make this and moreover that history is created for this Historian is sure that he is free for such work In this mithological world one\nare living not only historians but all people The fear of death is a cause of such\nconfidence In this note three Principles of Time will be formulated which say\nthat historians can not give us the truth text-book of History of any society 1\n\n\n### 1 Bayes Principle\n\nIn the book [1], Costa de Beauregard formulates the following\nBayes Principle Restoration of the Past can be made only in the case when\nthe a priori’s probabilities are known, i",
    "Restoration of the Past can be made only in the case when\nthe a priori’s probabilities are known, i e if some knowledge about the Past is\nassumed the knowledge of the Present can only specify one In other words, although the Future is statistically predicted the Past is not\nstatistically restored In [1], Costa de Beauregard gives very instructive example\nwhich belongs to Poincar´e The a priori’s probabilities are determinated on the basis historical documents,\ntherefore there exists the hope that in future the document will be found which\nwill ascertain the truth But this hope is vain as it follows from the third Principle\nof time (see §3) ### 2 Principle of the uncertainty of description\n\n\nThis principle has the following form\n\n\n∆D∆t ≥ c 1 (1)\n\n\nwhere ∆D is historical uncertainty, i e the number of contradictory details in\ndescription of historical event which occured for time ∆t, and c 1 - 0 is some\n\nconstant In other words, the less time of life of investigated historical event the more\ncontradictory details But it is known that many crimes are successfully investigated Does it mean\nthat second Principle is false No There exists the concept ”time of prescription” It is required the Third Principle of Time (see §3) ### 3 Principle of the interaction of epoches\n\n\nPrinciple of the uncertainty of historical description acts only under condition\nof realization another Principle which is called the Principle of the interaction\nof epoches and which asserts that historical uncertainty ∆D is more when the\ninvestigated epoch lies farther from present epoch:\n\n\n∆D ≤ c 2 ∆τ, (2)\n\n\n2\n\n\nwhere ∆τ is time interval between present and investigated epoches, c 2 - 0\nis some constant In other words, the more antique epoch the less chance to\nascertain the truth The formula (2) is similar to the Shenon Principle which asserts that precision\nof information (from one system to different one) which can be transfered and\nreceived is proportional to the time that runs out\n\n\n∆I ≤ k∆τ It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n∆τ ∆t ≥ c 1 c [−] 2 [1]\n\n\nor\n1\n∆t ≥ c 1 c [−] 2 [1] under ∆τ →∞ (3)\n∆τ [→] [0]\n\n\nIt means that for restoration of the events which belong to time interval ∆t of\ninteresting for us epoch must not be too near to the present one The constants c 1\nand c 2 are determinated from (1)-(3)",
    "The constants c 1\nand c 2 are determinated from (1)-(3) They must have such values to be possible\nthe investigations of crimes of the recent past For example, it must exist the\npossibility to restore uniquely all events, i e ∆D = 0 if a crime was done 1 hour\nago, ∆τ = 60 min In other words, c 1 ≤ 1 [min [−][1] ], and c 2 ≤ 1/60 [min [−][1] ] One\ncan take c 1 = 1 [min [−][1] ], and c 2 = 1/60 [min [−][1] ] We see that the problem of determination of constants c 1 and c 2 is not easy One can suppose that interaction of epoches has more composite oscillating\ncharacter with increasing amplitude\n\n\n\n2π∆τ\n∆D ≤ c 2 ∆τf (∆τ ) cos\n� T\n\n\n\n, (4)\n�\n\n\n\nwhere T is period and f (∆τ ) ≥ 0 is non-decreasing function The negative value\nof right side of (4) on segment ∆τ ∈ [T/4 + nT, 3T/4 + nT ] must be interpreted\nas epoches for which one-valued restoration of events is possible Uncertainty of historical description insreases for epoches ∆τ = nT when we\ndeepen in the Past Principle (4) is held for the resilient space-time V [4], i e V [4] when is a resilient\nleaf of some foliation F in five-dimensional space The resilient space-time winds\nround itself A movement along 5-th coordinate gives the infinite piercing of\nspace-time V [4] at the points of Past and Future [2, 3, 4, 5] The past epoches winds\nround present epoch and become nearer and nearer as this see the observer living\nin five-dimensional world The (almost) oscillation follows from this Let that\n\n\n3\n\n\nthe coming has value of the Plank’s length L ∼ 10 [−][33] cm for past epoches ∆τ =\nnT, n > n 0 Then natural fluctuations of 5-metric (electro-gravity-scalar field)\nwill make foam topology of four-dimensional space-time Hence the present epoch\nwill connect with the past epoches ∆τ = nT, n > n 0 by means of four-dimensional\nwormholes Hence the events of present and past are not differed under quantum\npoint of view The Past is mixed with the Present Such intermixing of Past with\nPresent must have some projection on the events of macro-world It follows from\n\n[2, 3] where it is shown that four-dimensional macro-wormholes connecting Past\nand Present can appear under perturbations of scalar fields Maybe oscillating character of intermixing of Past with Present was exposed\nin the statistical investigations of historical events by A T Fomenko [ ] ### References\n\n\n[1] Costa de Beauregard O Second principle of science about time – Le Temps et la\nPens´ee Physique contemporaine Prof J L Rigal (ed ) – Paris, Dunod, 1968 [2] Guts A K Many-dimensional gravitation and time machine – Izvestiya VUZov Fizika 1996, N 2 P 14-19 (Russian) [[3] Guts A K K Time machine as four-dimensional wormhole Time machine as four-dimensional wormhole – Preprint gr-qc/](http://arxiv org/abs/gr-qc/9612064)\n[9612064 – http://xxx lanl gov/abs/gr-qc/abs/ 9612064](http://arxiv org/abs/gr-qc/9612064)\n\n\n[4] Guts A K Time Machine as 4-Wormhole in the spring space- time // 14 Internat Grav Conference Workshop A Workshop A 3 - Mathematical Studies of Relativistic Field\nEquations, 1995 - A 106 - A 107 [5] Guts A K Multy-dimensional theory of gravity-electro-weak interactions, Time\nmachine and foliations // 1996 Joint Amer Phys Soc / Amer Asoc Phys [Teach Meeting, 2-5 May 1996, Abstract – http://www aps org/BAPSMAY96/](http://www aps org/BAPSMAY96/)\nabs/S1978002 html\n\n\n4"
