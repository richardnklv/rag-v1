    "## Electrode thickness measurement of a Si(Li) detector for the SIXA array\n\n### T Tikkanen\n\nObservatory and Astrophysics Laboratory, P O Box 14 (T¨ahtitorninm¨aki),\nFIN-00014 University of Helsinki, Finland\n\n### K H¨am¨al¨ainen, S Huotari\n\n\nDepartment of Physics, P O Box 9, FIN-00014 University of Helsinki, Finland\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nCathode electrodes of the Si(Li) detector elements of the SIXA X-ray spectrometer\narray are formed by gold-palladium alloy contact layers The equivalent thickness of\ngold in one element was measured by observing the characteristic L-shell X-rays of\ngold excited by monochromatised synchrotron radiation with photon energies above\nthe L 3 absorption edge of gold The results obtained at 4 different photon energies\nbelow the L 2 edge yield an average value of 22 4 ± 3 5 nm which is consistent with\nthe earlier result extracted from detection efficiency measurements PACS: 29 40 Wk; 85 30 De; 07 85 Nc; 95 55 Ka\n\n\nKey words: Si(Li) detectors, X-ray spectrometers, X-ray fluorescence, detector\ncalibration, gold electrodes, synchrotron radiation\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\n\nThe SIXA (Silicon X-Ray Array) detector [1] is a focal plane instrument of the\nSODART X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-X-Gamma satellite scheduled for launch in 1998 SIXA detects X-rays in the energy range between\n500 eV and 20 keV with a closely packed array of 19 discrete Si(Li) detector\nelements The elements are cylindrical and their active detection volume is\n9 2 mm in diameter and 3 0 mm in thickness X-rays impinge on the detector through the cathode side of the Si(Li) crystals The cathode consists of a contact layer manufactured by sputter deposition\nof gold-palladium alloy on the crystalline silicon The Au/Pd mass ratio of\n\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 25 June 2021\n\n\nthe alloy is 60:40 and the nominal thickness is 30 nm but deviations from this\nvalue are expected to be large for the individual detectors because the Si(Li)\ncrystals are batch processed to deposit the alloy Knowledge of the individual\nAu/Pd thickness for each element in the array is necessary, since the electrode\nthickness is the dominant factor determining the detection efficiency in the\nlower part of the energy range The electrode thickness can be deduced from absolute measurements of the\ndetection efficiency at low energies Such a measurement was carried out for\none detector element using synchrotron radiation in the soft X-ray energy region from the electron storage ring BESSY, yielding a result of 40 7 nm [2] However, in this case the windowless detector was operated in the beamline\nvacuum, which is not practically achievable for all SIXA elements which are\nassembled in a common capsule Instead, the calibration of the flight detector array will be done with harder X-ray sources such as X-ray tubes and\nradioisotopes We used the method of Hansen et al [3] to measure the gold thickness by\ndetecting the gold L-shell fluorescence induced by primary X-rays of higher\nenergy In principle, the palladium thickness could be measured similarly using\nprimary photon energies above the K edge of palladium, but this measurement\nwould not be possible with the flight array because its data acquisition system\nhas an upper limit of 20 keV It has been noted that the fluorescence lines are\nspread into broad bands due to the escape of photoelectrons from the contact\nlayer into the active detection volume [4] and an experimental correction for\nthe resulting error was applied by Campbell and Wang [5] We have modelled\nthe full shape of the fluorescence lines, including the low-energy tails as well\nas the high-energy tail contributions from the escape of Auger electrons and\nphotoelectrons Primary photon energies above the L 1 absorption edge of gold\nwere used in other reported measurements [6,4,7], but we used also energies\nbetween the L 3 and L 2 edges in order to eliminate the uncertainties from\nquantities related to the individual L subshells 2 Experiment\n\n\nUsing the transfer standard SIXA detector element which has been characterised at BESSY in the energy range below 5 keV [2], we recorded energy\nspectra using monochromatised synchrotron radiation at the beamline X18B\nof the electron storage ring NSLS at the Brookhaven National Laboratory The\ndetector was operated at about 106 K in a cryostat sealed with an aluminiumcoated polyimide window In addition, an 8 5 µm thick beryllium window was\nused to suppress light The windows were transparent in a circular area having a diameter of 5 9 mm Between the detector and the exit window of the\n\n\n2\n\n\nbeamline were an ionisation chamber and about 40 cm of air We attenuated\n\nthe beam by 8 orders of magnitude in order to reach reasonable count rates\nof about 1000 s [−][1] This was achieved by using two pinhole apertures Spectra were acquired first with the beam directed at the centre of the detector\nsurface A few examples are shown in Fig 1 together with model functions\nof the primary peak including the low-energy tail extrapolated from the lowenergy characterisation results The gold Lα line was best resolvable at the\nphoton energy of 12 5 keV and we used this energy when we recorded spectra\nwith the beam directed at 4 different positions on the detector surface 3 Fluorescence model\n\n\nWhen the Si(Li) detector is irradiated with X-rays, the gold atoms in the\ncontact layer emit characteristic photons isotropically into all directions The\ndetected fluorescence lines have more tailing than lines produced by normally\nincident primary radiation High-energy tails are formed by events where the\ncharacteristic photon is accompanied with an energetic electron escaping from\nthe electrode into the active detection volume Low-energy tails due to energy loss across the alloy/silicon interface are higher for isotropically incident\nradiation because absorption is more concentrated near the surface In the primary photon energy range of 11 919–13 734 keV between the L 3\nand L 2 edges, Lα 1 is the strongest fluorescence line and Auger electrons have\nusually greater energies than photoelectrons The most probable Auger electron to follow Lα 1 photon emission is M 5 N 5 N 7 (energy 1 79 keV) Its range\nin the Au/Pd alloy is R Aug = 21 nm [8] Assuming isotropic initial direction\ndistribution of the Auger electrons, the fraction of Auger electrons generated\nwithin the distance d ≤ R Aug from the alloy/silicon interface which will cross\nthe interface is given by p iso (d/R Aug ), where\n\n\n\n2\n\n� 2x − x [2] [�] [3] (1)\n\n\n\n1 − x [2] − [1]\n\n6\n\n\n\np iso (x) = [1]\n\n\n\n4 [x] √\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\n4 [arcsin][ x][ +] [ 1] 4\n\n\n\nFor most if not all detector elements the electrode thickness T is greater than\nR Aug and as the primary photons are absorbed very homogeneously throughout the whole thickness, the Auger electron escape probability is P Aug =\n(1 − ω M 5 )p iso R Aug /T, where ω M 5 is the M 5 -shell fluorescence yield and p iso ≡\np iso (1) = [π] [−] [1] [ The photoelectron escape probability is obtained similarly:]\n\n\n\n\n[π]\n\n8 [−] 6 [1]\n\n\n\np iso (1) = [π] 8 [−] 6 [ The photoelectron escape probability is obtained similarly:]\n\nP pho = p pho R pho /T, where p pho = 0 153 [9] is the average escape probability\nof the photoelectrons generated within their range R pho from the interface Adding these and subtracting the probability of simultaneous escape of both\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nelectrons to prevent these events from being counted twice, the tail-to-total\nratio for the high-energy tail is obtained as\n\n\nP h = P Aug + P pho (1 − P Aug ) (2)\n\n\nThe components of the low-energy tail for isotropically incident radiation are\nobtained by integration over all directions For the silicon escape peak the\nresult is, neglecting escape through the sides

from an external source of the same energy in Table 1 The flat shelf\ncontribution was calculated with T = 40 7 nm The total fraction of counts in\nthe low-energy tail is 1 8% while for normally incident radiation it is 0 7% When the primary beam is directed at the central region, all L-series characteristic photons emitted by gold atoms into the half-space formed by the Si(Li)\nbulk are

    "The contributions of the individual L subshells to µ\nwere calculated from the jump ratios using the data of Henke et al [10] [10] 4 Results\n\n\nNet counts in the gold fluorescence lines were calculated by fitting the modelled\nshape of the lines plus continuum to the data in the region of the Lα peak Ideally, the continuum is formed by the low-energy tail of the primary peak However, the measured continua are higher than the modelled tails in certain\nenergy regions (see Fig However, the measured continua are higher than the modelled tails in certain\nenergy regions (see Fig 1) A broad feature above 8 keV appears in all spectra\nup to the primary photon energy of 13 0 keV, including the data taken at\n11 8 keV which is below the L edges of gold This feature can be a measurement\nartifact or reflect the real shape of the tail; our extrapolated tail model is\nbased on a physical model which applies to photon energies below 4 keV [9] At photon energies above 13 0 keV, the Lα line of lead at 10 5 keV appears This line originates in lead impurities in the slits and apertures This line originates in lead impurities in the slits and apertures The continuum\nmight as well be modelled using the original form of the modified HYPERMET\nfunction [11,12] We tried both forms and added a first-order polynomial to fit\nthe unknown feature The best-fit lead Lα lines were added to the continuum\nat photon energies above the L 3 absorption edge of lead An example is shown\nin Fig 3 (original form) Fig",
    "Fig 4 presents the thicknesses obtained from Eq (10), both using the original\nHYPERMET form and the form of Ref [9] Statistical uncertainties (standard\ndeviation in the true photon number) were derived from the net counts in the\nLα peak Weighted average of the results from 12 0 to 13 5 keV at the detector\ncentre is 22 4 nm with a standard deviation of 3 5 nm with the original form\nand 22 2 ± 3 5 nm with the other form The 16% standard deviations are\nhigher than the real uncertainty of the intensity This is explained by the\nfluctuations of the continuum counts and by errors in the electron ranges,\nabsorption coefficients and other data Inclusion of the results up to 16 0 keV\nyields 22 8 ± 2 9 nm with the original form (results at 17 0 keV and above are\nexcluded because the continuum is dominated by Compton scattering) The\nresults at 12 5 keV at different positions yield an average of 23 9 nm with a\nstandard deviation of 2 3 nm which means that thickness variations across the\n\ndetector surface greater than the overall precision were not found 6\n\n\n5 Conclusion\n\n\nThe gold-palladium alloy contact layer thickness of a Si(Li) detector element\nfor the SIXA array was measured using monochromatised synchrotron radiation to excite L-shell fluorescence from gold The fluctuation of the result as\nfunction of primary photon energy yields an accuracy of about 3 nm in the\nequivalent thickness of gold The result is in agreement with an earlier result\n20 1±0 3 nm derived from a detection efficiency measurement [2] The contact\nlayer thicknesses of the elements in the SIXA flight array are to be measured\nusing monochromatised radiation of an X-ray tube with longer acquisition\ntimes which will reduce the uncertainty from photon statistics The accuracy\nwill be limited by the knowledge of the shape of the low-energy tail of the\nprimary peak and the uncertainty in the electron ranges and the absorption\ncoefficients and other data regarding the L subshells of gold",
