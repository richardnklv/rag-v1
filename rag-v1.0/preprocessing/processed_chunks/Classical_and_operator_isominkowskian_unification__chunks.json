    "For consistency the entire mathematical and physical structures of the original theories,\nmust be reconstructed with respect to thje above generalized unit and product, yielding\nthe so-called isonumbers, isospaces, isoalgebras, isogeometries, etc [3f] [3f] It is easy to see\nthat, for positive–definite generalized unit I [ˆ], all isotopic structures are locally isomorphic to\nthe original ones and, in this sense, all isotopies are axiom-preserving We should therefore\nindicate from the outset that the isotopies do not produce new theories, but merely new\nrealizations of existing theories, which is the main line of study of this paper The isotopic structures which are particularly significant for this paper are: the isominkowskian\nspaces [4a]; the isolorentz [4a] and isopoincar´e symmetries [4e,4f]; and the isospecial relativity [4], which is the axiom-preserving formulation of the conventional relativity on isominkowskian\nspaces under the isopoincar´e symmetry (see [4h] for a general presentation) The methods for the characterization of antimatter are the so-called isodualities [4b,5]\nwhich are characterized by the antiautomorphic map of all quantities A for matter into their\nanti-Hermitean forms −A†, thus implying negative-definite units −I [ˆ] Again, for consistency\nthe isodual map must be applied to all mathematical and physical formulations for matter,\nyielding isodual isonumbers, isodual isospaces, isodual isoalgebras, etc The isodual struc\n\n2\n\n\ntures which are particualrly important for this paper are: the isodual isominkowski spaces,\nthe isodual isopoincar´e symmetry, and the isodual isospecial relativity (see [4h] for a general\npresentation) Independent reviews and developments can be found in monographs [6], papers [7] and\nliterature quoted therein Ref",
    "Ref [6e] provides a comprehensive bibliography up to 1984, while\na subsequent bibliographical (and technical) survey is available in monograph [6d] The main lines of the classical geometric unification of the special and general relativities\nwere first submitted in ref [4d] as a natural consequence of the isopoincar´e symmetry The\nmain lines of the operator geometric unification of the special and general relativities were\nsubmitted for the first time at the VII Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity\nheld at Stanford University in July 1994 [8a] The above studies still lacked a rigorous form-invariant character because they were\nbased on the conventional differential calculus which has resulted to be noninvariant, and\nthus inapplicable under isotopies In this paper we present for the first time the fully form-invariant formulations of:\nI) The classical geometric unification of the general and special relativities for matter\ninto the isospecial relativity in which the former occurs for generalized units while admitting\nthe latter as a particular case for conventional units;\nII) The operator formulation of gravity for matter based on the abstract axioms of relativistic quantum mechanics, thus showing hope for a possible resolution of the ambiguities\nin current theories of quantum gravity; and\nIII) The classical and operator isodual formulations of antimatter The experimental validity of the classical isominkowskian formulation of gravity for matter is derived from the preservation of the conventional Einstein’s field equations except for\ninessential multiplicative terms The experimental validity of the operator isominkowskian\nformulation of gravity for matter is derived from the preservation of conventional quantum mechanical laws, with gravitational effects being notoriously very small as compared to\nthose of other interactions of the particle word The validity of the isodual formulations for\nantimatter is inferred from its compatibility with available experimnental data The above results have been made possible by the recent achievement of sufficient maturity for: mathematical content in memoir [3f] including the isotopies and isodualities of\ndifferential calculus and their applications to algebras, geometries and analytic mechanics;\ngeneral axiomatiic consistency in the physical formulations of both isotopic and isodual theories in memoir [3g]; and generalized symmetry principles for isotopic and isodual theories\nin memoir [7a] Further studies, such as the formulation of a grand unified theory with\nan axiomatically consistent inclusion of gravitation are presented in the fortcoming paper\n\n[10] An introductory outline of the main mathematical and physical aspects of this paper\nis available in Pages 18, 19 of Web Site [7u] A primary motivation for this paper is the following:\n\n\nTheorem 1 The basic unit of all (nowhere degenerate, real valued and symmetric) geometries with non–null curvature over conventional fields is not invariant under the symmetry\n\n\n3\n\n\nof their line element in both classical and quantum formulations",
    "A primary motivation for this paper is the following:\n\n\nTheorem 1 The basic unit of all (nowhere degenerate, real valued and symmetric) geometries with non–null curvature over conventional fields is not invariant under the symmetry\n\n\n3\n\n\nof their line element in both classical and quantum formulations Proof Let E = E(x, δ, R) and ℜ = ℜ(y, g, R) be n–dimensional Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, respectively, with the same signature (+, +, , +), basic unit I =diag (1, 1, , 1),\nmetrics δ = (δ ij = Diag (1, 1, , 1) and g(y) = (g ij ) = g [t], and local coordinates x =\n{x [k] }, y = {y [k] }, i, j, k = 1, 2, n, over the field R = R(n, +, ×) of real numbers n with\nconventional sum + and multiplication × The transformation x → y(x) for which the Euclidean metric is mapped into the Riemannian metric,\n\n\n\n\n[∂y] [r] ∂y [s]\n\n∂x [i] [ δ] [rs] ∂x [j]\n\n\n\nδ ij → g ij (y) = [∂y] [r]\n\n\n\n(1 1)\n∂x [j] [,]\n\n\n\nis necessarily noncanonical for non–null curvature Therefore, the symmetries of the Riemannian line elements y [2] = y [t] gy are necessarily noncanonical As such, these symmetries\ndo not generally preserve the basic unit I at the classical level because, by definition, noncanonical transforms do not leave invariant the fundamental canonical (symplectic) tensor\n\n\n\n, (1 2)\n�\n\n\n\n(ω µν ) =\n\n\n\n0 −I\n\nI 0\n�\n\n\n\ni e , they are of the type in phase space with local coordinates b = {x, p} → b [′] (b) = {x [′], p [′] }\n\n\n\n\n[a] ∂b [β]\n\n∂b [′][µ] [ ω] [αβ] ∂b [′][ν]\n\n\n\nω µν → ω µν [′] [=][ ∂b] [′][a]\n\n\n\n∂b [′][ν] [ =][ ω] µν [′] [(][a] [′] [)][ ̸][=][ ω] [µν] (1 3)\n\n\n\nBut the canonical tensor represents the fundamental space units of the theory, and this\nestablishes the inability of classical conventional geometries with non–null curvature to have\ninvariant basic units The symmetries of the same line element in operator formulation are then necessarily\nnonunitary for consistency (see Sect 5), and this proves the lack of invariance of the basic\nunit also for operator theories The same proof evidently applies for indefinite signatures\n(+, +, −, − ) (see later on for the (3+1)– dimensional case) q e d To understand the implications of the above theorem, recall that the basic unit of the\n(3+1) – dimensional Riemannian geometry is given by I = Diag ((1, 1, 1), 1), where the first\nthree components (1, 1, 1) represent the space units (say 1 cm) in dimensionless form, and\nthe fourth component represents the time unit (say 1 sec) also in dimensionless form Theorem 1 establishes that curvature implies the lack of invariance of the fundamental\nspace–time units of the theory, thus implying evident problematic aspects in the comparison\n\n\n4\n\n\nof the theory with experimental data In fact, one of the fundamental conditions for the\napplicability of the measurement theory is precisely the invariance of the basic unit As a result, Theorem 1 provides a new perspective of the various problematic aspects\nvoiced on Einstein’s gravitation during this century (see, e g , Ref [5h] for an outline with\nreferenbces) because it indicates that they are not necessarily due to Einstein’s field equations\nbut rather to their referral to a geometry in which the basic units opf space and time are\nnot invariant In fact, following Theorem 1, the same problematic aspects can be proved to\npersist for all possible modifications–enlargement of Einstein field equations Equivalently, Theorem 1 establishes that Riemannian spaces are a noncanonical deformation of the Minkowskian spaces (because the former are obtainable via noncanonical\ntransformations of the latter) and, as such, they suffer of all drawbacks of noncanonical\ntheories when formulated on conventional spaces over conventional fields In the next section we present a formulation of classical gravitation for matyter which\npreserves Einstein’s gravitational field equations unchanged and merely reformulates them\nin a new geometry, the isominkowskian geometry, with generalized yet invariant basic units\nunder its universal isopoincar`e symmetry The operator and antimatter profiles are studied\nin subsequent section To render this paper selfsufficient as well as for notational purposes,\neach section contains an outline of the new methods used therein ## 2 Classical isominkowskian unification of the special and general relativities for matter\n\n\nAs it is well known, there cannot be really new physical advances without new mathematics It turn, there cannot be really new mathematics without new numbers Still in turn, the\nonly possibility of identifying new numbers known to the author is via the generalization of\ntheir basic unit I = +1 → I [ˆ] called lifting (first proposed in [3a,3b]), where I [ˆ] is in general a\nwell behaved, n × n matrix with an unrestricted functional dependence of their elements on\ncoordinates x, their derivatives of arbitrary order and any needed additional quantity,\n\n\nI = +1 → I [ˆ] = I [ˆ] (x, ˙x, ¨x, ) (2 1)\n\n\nThe fundamental quantities of this paper are therefore given by new numbers with arbitrary units studied in details in ref s [3e,3f] A mere inspection of lifting (2 1) reveals a significant broadening of the conventional\nnumbers and, therefore, of the mathematical and physical theories built on them In fact,\nwe have the following primary classification [3f]: 1) Ordinary numbers occurring for I [ˆ] = +1;\n2)isonumbers occurring for Hermitean generalized units I [ˆ] = I [ˆ] [†] ; 3)genonumbers occurring\nfor nonhermitean generalized unit I [ˆ] ̸= I [ˆ] [†] ; and 4)hypernumbers occurring for generalized\nunits given by an ordered set of Hermitean quantities The latter three classes then admit\nsubclasses depending on whether the (real part of the)generalized unit is positive–definite,\n\n\n5\n\n\nsingular, etc The numbers, isonumbers, genonumbers and hypernumbers are used for the\ndescription of matter in condition of progressively increasing complexity (e g , reversible,\nnonreversible, etc ), with the most general possible hypernumbers being studied for the\ndescription of matter in its most complex conditions (e g , the DNA code) Moreover, the conventional numbers and each of the above generalizations admit antiautomorphic images I [ˆ] → I [ˆ] [d] = −I [ˆ] [†] called isoduality [4b,3e,3f] which are used for the\ndescription of antimatter also in physical conditions of progressively increasing complexity\n\n[5] It is evident that in a field of such a diversity we are forced for brevity to restrict our\nstudies to the first lifting, those of isotopic type and its isodual In this section we shall therefore study a classical representation of matter based on the isonumbers, the corresponding\nisodual representation of antimatter is studied in the next section Corresponding operator\nimages are studied in subsequent sections The genotopic and hyperstructual extensions of\nisotopic formulation of this paper are contemplated for study in subsequent works Let F = F (a, +, ∗) be a field of numbers (i e , real numbers a = n ∈ R, complex numbers\na = c ∈ C or quaternions a = q ∈ Q) with conventional sum a + b and product a × b = ab\nand corresponding additive unit 0 and multiplicative unit I The isofields are rings F [ˆ] = F [ˆ] (ˆa, +, ˆx) with elements ˆa = a × I, a [ˆ] ∈ F called isonumbers,where I [ˆ] a positive–definite quantity (e",
    "The isofields are rings F [ˆ] = F [ˆ] (ˆa, +, ˆx) with elements ˆa = a × I, a [ˆ] ∈ F called isonumbers,where I [ˆ] a positive–definite quantity (e g g , a matrix) generally outside the original set\nF equipped with:\n\n\ni) the isosum ˆa + [ˆ] b = (a + b) × I [ˆ] with conventional additive unit [ˆ] 0 ≡ 0, ˆa + 0 [ˆ] ≡ [ˆ] 0 + ˆa ≡\naˆ ∈ F (the preservation of the additive unit 0 is indicated by preserving the symbol\n+ unchanged in F [ˆ] (ˆa, +, ˆx)); and\n\n\nii) the isoproduct\n\n\naˆ× [ˆ] [ˆ] b = ˆa × T [ˆ] × [ˆ] b = (a × b) × I [ˆ] ∈ F, [ˆ] (2 2)\n\n\nunder which the quantity I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1] is the correct new left and right unit of F [ˆ]\n\n\nIˆ ˆ×aˆ ≡ aˆ×ˆ Iˆ ≡ A,ˆ ∀aˆ ∈ F,ˆ ˆI = ˆT [−][1], (2 3)\n\n\n(the change of the multiplicative unit is indicated with the new symbol × [ˆ] in F [ˆ] (ˆa, +, × [ˆ] )) When the above conditions are verified, the I [ˆ] is called the isounit and T [ˆ] is called the isotopic\nelement The fundamental mechanism of the isotopies responsible for their axiom–preserving character is that of lifting the multiplicative unit I → I [ˆ] while jointly the product is lifted by the\ninverse amount, × → × [ˆ] = ×T [ˆ] ×, I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1] This implies the following\nLemma 1 [3e]: Isofields satisfy all the axioms of a field 6\n\n\nDespite the local isomorphism F [ˆ] ≈ F, the lifting F → F [ˆ] is not trivial because it requires\na corresponding lifting of all operations of F For instance, the conventional square of a\n\nˆ\nnumber n [2] = n × n has no meaning for F [ˆ] and must be lifted into the isosquare ˆn [2] = ˆn× [ˆ] n Along similar lines we have theˆ ˆ 1 1 1 isopowers ˆn [m][ˆ] = ˆn× [ˆ] nˆ× [ˆ] × [ˆ] nˆ (m times); theˆ isosquare root\nn 2 = n 2 ˆ×I [ˆ] 2 ; the isoquotient ˆn [ˆ] /m = (ˆn/ ˆm) × I [ˆ] ; the isonorm [ˆ] |a [ˆ] | = |a| × I [ˆ], where |a| is the\nconventional norm; etc (see [3e] for brevity for all details) The nontriviality of the lifting\nF → F [ˆ] is then illustrated by the fact that numbers which are not prime for I = +1 may\nbecome prime for other units [3e] The axiomatic consistency of the emerging new structure is established by the local\nisomorphism between the conventional field and its isotopic image In particular, it should\nbe notes that the isounit preserves all axiomatic properties of the original unit, e",

I, [ˆ] [ˆ] |I [ˆ][ˆ] | ≡ I, [ˆ] etc (2 4)\n\n\nThe assumption of the isonumbers as the fundamental numbers requires a simple, yet\nunique and unambiguous reconstruction of contemporary mathematical and physical theories\ninto forms admitting of I [ˆ], rather than I, as the correct left and right unit Recall that the conventional metric spaces of contemporary physics are based on conventional fields of number the first and most important implication of the lifting I → I [ˆ] is\ntherefore the necessity to construct, for evident reason of consistency, corresponding liftings\nof metric spaces Let M = M(x, η, R) be a conventional Minkowski space [1] with coordinates x =\n{x [µ] } = {r, c o t}, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4, where c o is the speed of light in vacuum, with basic unit\nI = Diag (+1, +1, +1, +1) and metric η = Diag (+1, +1, +1, −1) over a field R = R(n, +x)\nof real numbers n equipped with the conventional sum + and product ×, additive unit 0\nand multiplicative unit I ˆ\nThe lifting R(m, +, ×) → R(ˆn, +, ˆ×) then requires the corresponding lifting of theˆ ˆ\nMinkowski into the isominkowski spaces M = M(x, η, R) → M = M (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) first submitted in [4a] which are characterized by theˆ isocoordinates ˆx = x × I [ˆ] on R [ˆ], the isometric\nN µν = ˆη µν × ˆI = ˆT µ [α] [(][x,][ ˙][x,][ ¨][x, ][)][η] [αν] [×][ ˆ][I][ where ˆ][I][ = ˆ][T] [ −][1] [ is now in general a 4][×][4

[ˆ] This condition requires the re–definition\n\nˆ\nx → x = x × I, [ˆ] ˆη µν → N [ˆ] µν = ˆη µν × I [ˆ], etc Note however the practical redundancy of using isocoordinates ˆx = x × I [ˆ] In fact, we\ncan write ˆx [ˆ2] = (x [µ] × ˆη ν × x [ν] ) × I [ˆ] = x [ˆ2] For simplicity we shall hereon use the conventional\ncoordinates Note also the redundancy of using the full isoscalar form N [ˆ] of the isometric\nbecause the reduced form ˆη with ordinary elements ˆη µν in R is sufficient The understanding\nis that the full isotopic formulations are needed for mathematical consistency We shall hereon assume the convention, rather familiar in the literature of the isotopies,\nthat all quantities with a ”hat” are computed in isospaces over isofields, and the corresponding quantities without a ”hat” are computed on conventional spaces over conventional\nfields Note the necessary condition that isospaces and isofields have the same isounit This\ncondition is absent in the conventional Minkowski space where the unit of the space is the\nunit matrix I = diag (1, 1, 1, 1) while that of the underlying field is the number I = +1 Nevertheless, the latter can be trivially reformulated with the common unit matrix I, by\nachieving in this way the form admitted as a particular case by the covering isospaces\n\n\nM(x, η, R) : x [2] = (x [µ] × η µν × x [ν] ) × I ∈ R (2 8)\n\n\nAlso, one should keep in mind for future needs the following\n\n\nBasic − Isoinvariant = (length) [2] × (unit) [2] (2 9)\n\n\nA fundamental property of the infinite family of generalized spaces (8) is that the lifting of\nthe basic unit I → I [ˆ] while the metric is lifted of the inverse amount, η → ηˆ = T [ˆ] ×η, I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1],\nimplies the preservation of all original axioms, and we have the following:\n\n\nLemma 2 [4]: The isominkowski spaces M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) over the isofields R [ˆ] (ˆn, +, × [ˆ] ) with\na common positive–definite isounit I [ˆ] preserve all original axioms of the Minkowski space\nM(x, η, R) over the reals R(n, +, ×) The nontriviality of the lifting is that of gaining an unrestricted functional dependence\nof the metric eta [ˆ] = ˆη(x, ˙x, ¨x)ˆ under the conventional Minkowskian axioms The local isomorphism M ≈ M holds to such an extent that the isominkowski and\nMinkowski spaces coincide at the abstract, realization–free level by conception and construction Thus, the isominkowskian spaces are not new spaces, but merely ”new realizations” of\nthe original abstract Minkowskian axioms In particular, the maximal causal speeds of both\nspaces coincides and it is given by c 0 as we shall see 8\n\n\nLemma 2 illustrates again the ”axiom–preserving” character of the isotopies indicated\nin Sect 1, this time at the level of metric spaces It should be stressed that the ”isotopies”\nare inequivalent to the various forms of ”deformations” of the current literature for several\nreasons, such as: the former are axiom–preserving while the latter are not; the former are\ndefined over generalized fields while the latter are not; etc To avoid confusion, readers\nare discouraged from using the term ”deformations” (of given structure into a nonisomorphic form) when referring to the ”isotopies” ( of the same structures into axiom–preserving\nisomorphic forms) The isominkowskian geometry was first proposed in ref [4a] (see ref s [4g,4h] for comprehensive studies and ref s [6,7] for independent works) These studies were however incomplete\nbecause based on the conventional differential calculus which has resulted to be inapplicable\nunder isotopies The foundations of the isominkowskian geometry formulated via the isodifferential calculus of ref [3f] are introduced here apparently for the first time, with more\ndetailed studies presented elsewhere [9] Stated in a nutshell, the isominkowskian geometry is a symbiotic union of the Minkowskian\nand Riemannian geometries along the following main properties:\n\n\nI) Isoflatness It is easy to see that the isominkowskian geometry is flat in isospace\nover isofields, a property called isoflatness [4g] This is due to the fact that curvature, which\nis represented by the factor T [ˆ] in the isometric eta [ˆ] = T [ˆ] × eta, is referred to its own inverse\nas unit In fact, the new geometry permits the definition in isospace of straight line and\nintersecting angles, although in a predictable generalized form, which is not possible in the\nRiemannian geometry, thus confirming the preservation of the Minkowskian axioms In particular, isoflatness allows the reconstruction in isospace M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) of the trigonometric, hyperbolic and other functions for a metric with an arbitrary functional dependence,\nwhich we cannot possibly review here (see [4g] for brevity) More generally, the isominkowskian geometry is based on the new isofunctional analysis\nin which the isospace M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) is turned into an isomanifold thanks to Kadeisvili’s isocontinuity [7p] and Tsagas–Sourlas isotopology [7q] Within such a setting, the isogeometry\nmust be solely elaborated with all special isofunctions, isotransforms and isodistributions,\netc (see [4g,4h] for details) II) Pseudocurvature In view of the arbitrary functional dependence of the isometric\nηˆ = ˆη(x, ˙x, ¨x), the isominkowskian geometry can also be considered as being curved, but\nonly when projected in the original space M over the original field R, a property is called\npseudocurvature which is of Riemannian (rather than Minkowskian) character This illustrates the symbiotic capacity of the isominkowskian geometry of unifying the\nmain characteristics of both, the Minkowskian and Riemannian geometries In turn, such\ncharacter is evidently at the foundation of the proposed isominkowskian unification of the\n\n\n9\n\n\nspecial and general relativities To outline the pseudocurved character, consider the isominkowskian manifolds M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] )\nequipped with Kadeisvil’s isocontinuity and Tsagas-Sourlas isotopology The isodifferential calculus on M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) can be defined via the following notions of isodifferentials and\nisoderivatives [3f]\n\n\ndxˆ [µ] = ˆI ν [µ] [×][ dx] [ν] [,][ ˆ][∂] [µ] [ = ˆ][∂/][∂x][ˆ] [µ] [ = ˆ][T] µ [ ν] [×][ ∂] [ν] [ = ˆ][T] µ [ µ] [×][ ∂/∂x] [ν] [,] (2 10)\n\n\nˆ ˆ\n∂x [µ] /∂x [ν] = δ

the isochristoffel’s symbols (2 12) deviate from the conventional symbols by the\nsame factor T [ˆ] (because ˆη ≡ g) But these symbols must be referred to the isounit I [ˆ], thus\npreserving conventional values A similar situation occurs for the isocurvature tensor (2 17)\nbecause the factor T [ˆ] from the covariant isoderivative ∂ [ˆ] is compensated by the factor I [ˆ]\noriginating from

of Eq s (2 4) and related isominkowskian geometry is presented\nin ref [9], including the use of the forgotten Freud identity of the Riemannian geometry in\nisotopic form 11\n\n\nIII) Isosymmetries A primary reason for introducing the isominkowskian spaces and\nrelated geometry is that they permit the construction of the universal symmetry of the line\nelement (2 6) under an unrestricted functional dependence of the isometric ˆη(x, ˙x, ¨x, ) [4],\nwhile such a possibility is precluded in the Riemannian geometry Under the above isotopic reformulations, the symmetries of the isoinvariant (2 6) can beˆ\nexplicitly computed and are given by: the isorotational symmetry O(3) [4b]for the space\ncomponent of isoinvariant (2 6); the isolorentz symmetryL [ˆ] (3 1) [4a]; the isotopic SU [ˆ] (2)–spin\nsymmetry [4c]; the isopoincar´e symmetry P [ˆ] (3 1)= L [ˆ] (3 1)×T (3 1) [4d]; and the isospinorial\nisopoincar´e symmetry ℜ(3 1)= SL [ˆ] (2 C [ˆ] ) × T [ˆ] (3 1) [4e] These isosymmetries are constructed via the isotopies of Lie’s theory including the\nisotopies of enveloping algebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups transformation and representation theories, etc , originally proposed by the author in memoir [3a], developed in various\nworks [3,4,5], studied by a number of independent researchers [6,7] and today called Lie–\nSantilli isotheory [6,7] The isosymmetries O [ˆ] (3), SU [ˆ] (2), L [ˆ] (3 1), P [ˆ] (3 1) and P [ˆ] (3 1) are essentially the conventional symmetries O(3), SU(2), L(3 1), P (3 1) and P(3 1) reconstructed for\narbitrary generalized units I [ˆ] (x, ˙x, ¨x, ) of the class admitted (4×4– dimensional, real–valued,\nsymmetric and positive–definite matrices with the same dimension of the representation considered) Since I [ˆ] is positive–definite by assumption, the above isosymmetries are isomorphic to the\noriginal symmetries by conception and constructions [4] As such,they are not ”new symmetries”, and merely constitute the most general known nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical\nrealizations of the conventional symmetries For classical realizations of the above isosymmerties we have to refer the interested reader\nto monographs [4g,4h] An outline of their operator realization is presented in Sect",
    "An outline of their operator realization is presented in Sect 7 4) Isospecial relativity The preceding formalism is reduced to primitive laws under\nthe name of isospecial relativity [4] which is the isotopic image of the special relativity [1]\nrealized on isominkowskian spaces M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) As such, we do not have a ”new” relativity,\nbut merely the most general known realization of the axioms of the conventional relativity In fact, the special and isospecial relativity coincides at the abstract level by conception and\nconstruction, to such an extent to have the same light cone with the same maximal causal\nspeed c 0 (see below) 5) Isoanalityc mechanics Finally, the preceding formalism is complemented with\nstep–by–step–isotopies of conventional Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics called isoanalityc mechanics, which begins with a basic action in isospace and includes the isotopies of\nequations by Lagrange’s, Hamilton’s, Hamilton–Jacobi, etc (see [3f] for brevity) 12\n\n\nDespite all these similarities between conventional and isotopic structures, one should\nkeep in mind that the conventional Minkowski geometry, the Poincar´e symmetry and the\nspecial relativity are strictly linear, local–differential and Hamiltonian On the contrary, their\nisotopic images are generally nonlinear (in any desired variable), nonlocal–integral (i e , they\nadmit integral terms under the Tsagas–Sourlas integro–differential topology [5q], provided\nthat they are all embedded in the generalized unit I [ˆ] ), and nonlagrangian (in the sense of\nadmitting terms simply beyond any representational capability of a (first-order) lagrangian\n(see later on for details) Also, the isotopic structures have been proved by Aringazin [7r] to be directly universal,\nthat is, applying for all infinitely possible, well behaved, signature preserving generalizations\nof the Minkowski metric (universality), directly in the x–frame of the observer (direct universality) As a result, any conventional deformation of M can be identically reformulated\nvia the isotopic formalism, and the isotopic, axiom–preserving representation of deformed\nMinkowski spaces holds even when not desired, thus implying the existence of various applications and experimental verifications [7r] The isominkowskian geometry, the isopoincar´e symmetry and the related isospecial relativity were originally introduced [4] for a direct representation of interior dynamical problems,\ne g",

all this in a manifestly form–invariant way because the isounit I [ˆ] is the basic invariant of the isopoincar´e\nsymmetry [4] These features have permitted additional applications and verifications with\neffects due to deformations of shape [4–7] The application of the isospecial relativity submitted in this paper is basically different\nthan the above ones In fact, in this paper deals with the classical isotopic formulation of\nthe general relativity for matter via the isominkowskian geometry It should be stress up–\nfront that it would be unreasonable to expect in this first introductory paper a comprehensive\ntreatment at all possible epistemological, geometric, operator, quantum field field theoretical,\nexperimental and other aspects The rather limited objective of this study is to identify\nthe essential axiomatic foundations of the isospecial relativity in its application to gravity,\npoint out its plausibility for resolving at least some of rather old problematic aspects of the\nconventional formulation of gravity, and indicate its experimental validity In summary, the representation of gravity via the isospecial relativity is based on the\nrestriction of the isominkowskian metric to represent identically any given Riemannian metric,and in the isotopic factorization of the conventional Minkowski metric,\nrelativity is characterized by the isominkowskian geometry whose isometric ˆη is assumed\nto coincide with the Riemannian one, ˆη ≡ g(x), and we shall write\n\n\nˆ\nM (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) : ˆη ≡ g(x) = T [ˆ] gr (x) × η, I [ˆ] gr (x) = [ T [ˆ] gr (x)] [−][1]    - 0",

0, in the unit of unified gauge theories, whose\nstudies were initiated by Gasperini [7o] (see also the review in App A of monograph [6a])\nand pointed out in Ref [4h] G) The formulation permits a novel relativistic and gravitational treatment of antimatter at both classical and quantum levels [5] studied in the next section, which avoids the\nproblematic aspects of the Riemannian representation of antimatter outlined below H) The formulation permits a direct geometric representation of interior relativistic and\ngravitational problems, for instance, a direct representation of the locally varying speed of\nlight c = c 0 /n 4 via the metric of the isominkowskian geometry with T [ˆ] 44 = n [−] 4 [2] [×][g] [44] [ This lat-]\nter possibility is permitted by the unrestricted functional dependence of the isometric which,\nwhen restricted to a sole x–dependence, characterizes exterior gravitational problems in the\nhomogeneous and isotropic vacuum, while the use of a more general dependence characterizes interior gravitational problems within inhomogeneous and anisotropic physical media\n(with the understanding that the background space remains homogeneous and isotopic) The axiomatic consistency of the isominkowskian formulation of gravity is assured by the\naxiom–preserving character of the isotopies The plausibility of the proposed theory is illustrated by a comparison of properties A)–H)\nabove with the corresponding features of the conventional formulation of gravity The experimental verification of the isominkowskian formulation of gravity is established\nby the fact that Eq",

Other aspects are studied in the\nforthcoming paper [9] A property of the isodual isominkowskian geometry most important for this paper is\nthat the isodual energy–momentum tensor is negative–definite, exactly as needed for overall\nconsistency in any theory of antimatter The next isoduality is that of the basic isosymmetries studied in [4d,4e], yielding the\nisodual isorotation, isodual isolorentz and the isodual isopoincar´e symmetry The next\nconjugation is that of the isorelativity, yielding the isodual isospecial relativity, and of\nanalytic mechanics, yielding the isodual isoanalytic mechanics which are not outlined for\nbrevity [4d,4h] In order to apply the above results to a unified treatment of antimatter, the reader should\nbe aware that all preceding formulations admit as particular cases the isodual numbers,\nisodual Minkowskian geometry, isodual Poincar´e symmetry and isodual special relativity,\nnamely, they admit hitherto unknown antiautomorphic images of conventional theories which\nare here assumed for the relativistic characterization of antimatter in vacuum The classical isomincowskian reformulation of general relativity for antimatter is then\ngiven by the isodual isospecial relativity under the particular realization of the isodual isotopic element and isodual isounit\n\n\nˆ\nM [d] (ˆx [d], ˆη [d], R [ˆ] [d] ) : ˆη

reasonable doubts Its plausibility is established by its resolution of the problematic aspects of conventional formulations\n(see also next sections) Tshe physical validity of the classical isodual theory is established by\nthe verification of the sole classical experimental data on antimatter available at this writing,\nthose under electromagnetic interactions, because those under gravitational interactions are\nstill unknown We can therefore conclude these introductory considerations on the unification of the\nspecial and general relativity for antimatter by indicating that the emerging novelty warrants additional studies in the field In fact, the isodual theory permits a mathematically\ncorrect study of the gravitational field of astrophysical bodies made up of antimatter and\nthe initiation of studies for the future experimental resolution whether a far away star or\nquasar is made up of matter or of antimatter [5] 19\n\n\n## 4 Problematic aspects of quantum gravity\n\nWe now pass to the study of the unification of the special and general relativities at the\noperator level Again, we have to insist that it would be unreasonable to expect a comprehensive treatment in this introductory paper of all operator and field theoretical aspects,\nbecause they are so many to discourage even a partial outline The remaining scope of this paper is merely that of identify the essential operator foundations of the isospecial relativity, and establish its plausibility as compared to other operator\nforms of gravity at the simplest possible level of ”first quantization” In any reasonable\nconduction of research, quantum field theoretical aspects can only be considered after the\nidentification of hitherto unknown isogravitational grounds in first quantization By keeping in mind that the physical validity of the conventional quantum treatment of gravity\nis still debated after three quarters of a centuries of studies, the reader should not expect\nthe resolution of the physical validity of the isooperator treatment of gravity in its first\npresentation The basic open problems in the operator version of general relativity are the following:\nA) On one side, relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) needs a meaningful Hamiltonian\nwhile, on the other side, Einstein’s gravitational in vacuum has a null Hamiltonian B) There is the need of an operator gravity which is as axiomatically consistent as the\nconventional RQM, i e , invariant under its own time evolution with physical quantities which\nare Hermitean–observable at all times, with unique and invariant numerical predictions, etc C) Recent studies on interior gravitational problems of black holes (see, e g , the studies\nby Ellis et all [7s] and references quoted therein) have indicated that operator gravity should\nbe a nonunitary image of conventional quantum theories, as needed, e g , for a representation\nof irreversibility The isominkowskian reformulation of general relativity permits a new operator version\nof gravity for matter here called operator isotopic gravity, or operator isogravity (OIG) for\nshort, which is based on an axiom–preserving lifting of the unit of RQM from the trivial value\nI = Diag (1, 1, 1, 1) to the gravitational value I [ˆ] gr (x) As such OIG requires no Hamiltonian\nat all, thus resolving the first historical problem The axiomatic consistency of the proposed\nOIG is guaranteed by the preservation of the abstract axioms of RQM, only realized in a\nmore general way, including form–invariance, Hermiticity of observables at all times, etc ,\nthus resolving the second problem Finally, the proposed OIG is a rather natural nonunitary\nimage of conventional RQM, thus verifying the third condition The isodualites then permit an antiautomorphic isodual operator isogravity (IOIG) which\nis based on the negative–definite gravitational units of the preceding section A preliminary comparison of the OIG with the conventional theory currently used, called\nquantum gravity (QG) [12] is in order Even though both theories are of operator character,\nOIG and the conventional QG are inequivalent, as illustrated by the fact that, e g",
    "g , they are\ndefined on inequivalent Hilbert spaces and fields In any case, the term ”quantum” would be\ninappropriate under a nonunitary structure as requested by condition C) and, for this and\n\n\n20\n\n\nother reasons we have preferred the generic term ”operator” As we shall see, the term ”quantum” is also questionable for ”quantum gravity” because\nthis latter theory too is outside the equivalence classes of RQM In shot, this paper presents\nevidence supporting the fact that a ”quantum” version of gravity, that is a version obeying\nconventional quantum mechanics, cannot exist, as one can anticipate from the noncanonical\nstructure of the Riemannian geometry (Theorem 1 of Sect 1) The identification of the following problematic aspects of QM [3g,13] is in order, not\nonly because necessary to appraise the plausibility of OIG on a comparative basis, but also\nbecause they do not appear to be well known in the specialized literature in the field:\nI) QG does not possess an invariant basic unit, as established by theorem 1 Also, the\ntime evolution of QG is necesserily nonunitary (otherwise QG would be a trivial element of\nthe equivalence class of RQM), thus confirming the lack of invariance of the basic unit,\n\n\nI → I [′] = U × I × U [†] ≠ I (4 1)\n\n\nTherefore, all forms of QG gravity with a nonunitary time evolution (hereon assumed) lack\nunambiguous applications to experimental verifications;\nII) QG does not preserve Hermiticity in time when formulated on a conventional Hilbert\nspace over a conventional field In fact, under a nonunitary transform, the familiar associative modular action of the Schr¨odinger’s representation H × |ψ >, where H is an operator\nHermitean at the initial time, becomes\n\n\nU × H × |ψ > = U × H × U [†] × (U × U [†] ) [−][1] × U × |ψ >= H [ˆ] × T [ˆ] × |ψ >, [ˆ]\n\nˆ\nU × U [†] ≠ I, T = (U × U [†] ) [−][1], |ψ >= U × |ψ >, ˆH = U × H × U [†] (4 2)\n\n\nBy nothing that T [ˆ] is Hermitean, T [ˆ] = (U × U [†] ) [−][1] = T [ˆ] [†], the initial condition of Hermiticity\nof H, < ψ| × H × |ψ > = < | × H [†] × |ψ >, when applied to the conventional Hilbert space\nH with states |ψ >, [ˆ] |φ > [ˆ], etc, requires the action of the transformed operator ( ) on a\nconventional inner product, resulting in the expressions\n\n\n< ψ [ˆ] | × {H [ˆ] × T [ˆ] × |ψ > [ˆ] } = {< ψ [ˆ] | × T [ˆ] × H [ˆ] [†] } × |ψ >, [ˆ] i e ,H [ˆ] [†] = T [ˆ] [−][1] × H [ˆ] × T [ˆ] ̸= H [ˆ] (4 3)\n\n\nAs such, Hermiticity is not preserved under the time evolution of nonunitary theories when\nformulated on conventional space H over conventional fields C, because of the lack of general commutativity of T [ˆ] and H [ˆ] Consequently, QG does not admit physically acceptable\nobservables, an occurrence first indicated by Lopez [13a] III) QG does not admit invariant physical laws and numerical predictions These are\nan evident consequence of the nonunitarity of the time evolution and do not require further\nelaboration An objectives of this paper is to see whether our OIG permits the resolution of at least\nsome of the above problematic aspects At any rate, the lack of resolution until now of the\n\n\n21\n\n\nabove problematic aspects does warrant the study of structurally novel operator formulations\nof gravity ## 5 Isotopic completion of relativistic quantum mechan- ics and its isodual\n\n\nWe now outline for the reader’s convenience the operator isotopies, first proposed in ref [3b]\nof 1978 and then studied by numerous authors and known under the name of relativistic\nhadronic mechanics (RHM) This outline is recommendable because axiomatic maturity of\nthe new mechanics has been reached oly recently in memoir [3g], following the achievement\nof mathematical maturity in Ref [3f]",

of Sect 2 does indeed admit a unique and\nunambiguous operator counterpart which cannot be ”quantum”, but which is nevertheless\ncharacterized by the abstract quantum axioms only in a more general realization The isodual isominkowskian formalism of Sect 3 does indeed admit a unique operator\ncounterpart which is the antiautomorphic image of the preceding one, thus being particularly\nsuited for the representation of antiparticles Also, the isodual operator formalism originates\nfrom a new quantization specifically built for the quantization of antimatter into antiparticles [3g] This appears to resolve the long standing impasse of the theoretical representation\nof antimatter caused by the uniqueness of quantization vis–a–vis the duality of matter and\nantimatter, and opens up a new horizon of possibilities It should be stressed again that we have indicated in this section the axiomatic consistency and plausibility of the operator isotopic treatment of particles (generally intended\n\n\n28\n\n\nfor particles in interior conditions) and the isodual isotopic representation of antiparticles\n(generally intended for antiparticles in interior conditions) Preliminary studies indicate encouraging possibilities of experimental verifications under\nthe conditions in which the formulations are applicable, although such physical validity can\nonly be established as a result of collegian and predictably protracted investigations ## 6 The universal isopoincar´e symmetry and its isodual\n\n\nAny appraisal of OIG requires at least a minimal knowledge of the operator form of its\nuniversal symmetry, the isopoincar´e symmetry [4], specifically realized for gravity, which is\nstudied in this section following the achievement of sufficient maturity in isosymmetries by\nKadeisvili in memoir [7a] The isopoincar´e symmetry (also called in the literature the Santilli’s isopoincar´e symmetry [4,5]) is the universal symmetry of isoline element (2 6) Therefore, the basic invariant\n\n× quantity is not (length) [2], but the broader structure (length) [2] (unit) [2]\nThe isopoincar´e symmetry can be constructed via the step–by–step application of the\nisotopies of enveloping associative algebras, Lie algebras, Lie groups, transformation and\nrepresentation theory, etc called Lie–Santilli isotheory [6–7] and consists in the reconstruction\nof the conventional symmetry P(3 1) for the generalized unit I [ˆ] = T [ˆ] [−][1] Since I > [ˆ] 0, one can\nsee form the inception that P [ˆ] (3 1) ≈ P (3 1) Evidently we cannot review here the rigorous construction of the isosymmetry P [ˆ] (3 1) and\nwe have to limit ourselves for brevity to identify its essential aspects The liftingˆ P (3 1) →\nP (3 1) is constructed by preserving the conventional generators of the Poincar´e symmetry\n\n\nX = {X k } = {M µν, ×p α }, M µν = x µ × p ν − x ν × p µ, (6 1)\n\n\nk = 1, 2, , 10, µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4, (6 2)\n\n\nand the conventional parameters\n\n\nw = w k = (θ, v), a ∈ R, (6 3)\n\n\nalthough they are now formulated in isospaces over isofiuelds, and by submitting to an\nisotopies the operations constructed on them In fact the above quantities represent physical characteristics such as energy, linear momentum, angles, velocities, etc , which are not affected by short range interactions, the latter\nbeing represented by generalized operations among conventional physical quantities The connected component of the isopoincar´e symmetry is given by P [ˆ] 0 (3 1) = SO [ˆ] (3 1)× [ˆ] T [ˆ] (3 1),\nwhere SO [ˆ] (3 1) is the connected isolorentz group first introduced in [4a] and T [ˆ] (3 1) is the\ngroup of isotranslations [3d], and it is characterized by the isotransforms on M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ),\n\n\nˆ\nx [′] = A [ˆ] ( ˆw)× [ˆ] x = A [ˆ] ( ˆw) × T [ˆ] × x = A [˜] (w) × x, A = ˜A × ˆI, (6 4)\n\n\n29\n\n\nwhere the first form is the mathematically correct one, the last form being used for computational simplicity The above isotransforms can be expressed via the isoexponention in ξ [ˆ]\n\n\nˆ\nA( ˆw) = ˆe [i][×][X][×][w] = ˆI + (i × X × w)/1 + (i × X × w)ˆ×(i × X × w)/2 + (6 5)\n\n\ncharacterized by the isotopic Poincar´e–Birkhoff–Witt Theorem [3a,3d] and reducible to the\nconventional exponentiation for computational simplicity\n\n\nˆ\nA( ˆw) = ˆe [i][×][X][×][w] = {e [i][×][X][×][T] [×][w] } × ˆI = ˜A(w) × ˆI (6 6)\n\n\nThe (connected component of the) isopoincar´e group can therefore be written as (or\ndefined by ) [4]\n\n\nˆ\nP 0 (3 1) : ˆA( ˆw) = Π k eˆ [i][×][X][×][w] = (Π k e [i][×][X][×][ ˆ][T] [×][w] )ˆI = ˜A(w) × ˆI, (6 7)\n\n\nThe preservation of the original dimension is ensured by the isotopic Baker–Campbell–\nHausdorff Theorem [3a,3d] It is easy to see that structure (6 7) forms a connected Lie–\nSantilli transformation isogroup with isogroup laws\n\n\nˆ ˆ ˆ\nA( ˆw)ˆ× ˆA( ˆw [′] ) = ˆA( ˆw [′] )ˆ× ˆA( ˆw) = ˆA( ˆw + ˆw [′] ), A( ˆw)ˆ× ˆA(−w) = ˆA(0) = ˆI = ˆT [−][1] (6 8)\n\n\nNote that the use of the original Poincar´e transform x [′] = A(w) × x would now violate\nlinearity in isospace, besides not yielding the desired symmetry of isoseparation (2 6) The isotopy of the discrete transforms is elementary [4e], and reducible to the forms\n\n\nˆ\nπ× [ˆ] x = π × x = (−r, x [4] ), ˆτ × [ˆ] x = τ × x = (r, −x [4] ), (6 9)\n\nwhere ˆπ = π × I [ˆ], and π, τ are the conventional inversion operators To identify the isoalgebra ˆp 0 (3 1) of P [ˆ] 0 (3 1) we use the isodifferential calculus [3f] on M [ˆ]\noutlined earlier which yields the isocommutation rules [4]\n\n\n[ M [ˆ] µν,ˆM [ˆ] αβ ] = i × (ˆη να × M [ˆ] µβ − ηˆ µα × M [ˆ] νβ − ηˆ νβ × M [ˆ] µα + ˆη µβ × M [ˆ] αν ), (6 10)\n\n\n[ M [ˆ] µν,ˆˆp α ] = i × (ˆη µα× pˆ ν − ηˆ να × ˆp µ ), (6 11)\n\n\nˆˆ\n\n[ˆp α, p β ] = 0, (6 12)\n\n\nwhere [A,ˆB] is the Lie–Santilli product which satisfies the Lie axioms in isospace, as one can\nverify The isocasimir invariants are given by\n\n\nC [(0)] = I [ˆ] (x, ˙x, ψ, ∂ψ, ) = T [ˆ]

is ensured by the positive–definiteness of T [ˆ] Alternatively, the use of the generators in the form M ν [µ] [=][ x] [µ] [ ×][ p] [ν] [ −] [x] [ν] [ ×][ p] [µ] [ yields the]\nconventional structure constants under a generalized Lie product, as one can verify The\nabove local isomorphism is sufficient, per s´e, to guarantee the axiomatic consistency of\nRHM The space components SO [ˆ] (3), called isorotations and first introduced in [4b], can be\ncomputed from isoexpontiations (6 7) and the space components T [ˆ] kk of the isotopic element\nin diagonal form, T [ˆ] = Diag (T µµ ), yielding the

similar to the Lorentz transforms, as expected from their isotopic character This also confirms the local isomorphism SO [ˆ] (3 1) ≈ SO(3 1) [4] The Lorentz–Santilli isotransforms characterize the so–called isolight cone [4], i e , the\nperfect cone in isospace M [ˆ] (ˆx, ˆη, R [ˆ] ) In a way similar to the isosphere, we have the deformation of the light cone axes 1 µ → T [ˆ] µµ while the corresponding units are deformed of the inverse\namount 1 µ → T [ˆ] µµ [−][1] [, thus preserving the original perfect cone character Such a preservation]\nis then the geometric foundation of the local

→ x [d] = −x,\n\n\n(x − y) [2] = [(x [µ] − y [µ] ) × η µν × (x [ν] − y [ν] )] × I ≡\n≡ [(x [µ] − y [µ] ) × (−η µν ) × (x [ν] − y [ν] )] × (−I) =\n= [(x [µ] − y [µ] ) [d] × η µν [d] [×][ (][x] [ν] [ −] [y] [ν] [)] [d] []][ ×][ I] [d] [ ≡] [(][x][ −] [y][)] [d][2][d] [ ] (6 24)\n\n\ncalled by this author isoselfduality, which is at the foundation of the isodual representation\nof antimatter [5] The above invariance evidently assures the plausibility of the isodual treatment of antimatter also at the geometric level, because the same Minkowskian invariant holds for both\nconventional and isodual systems Isoselfduality (6 24) establishes the existence and applicability of the isodual Poincar´e\nsymmetry P [ˆ] [d] (3 1) [4d], which can be easily constructed from the isodual rules of the preceding section, and it is hereon assumed as known We here define as the restricted isopoincar´e transforms that constituted by isorotations,\nisolorentz boosts, isotranslations, isoinversions and isoselfscalar transformations when all\nparameters are constants, otherwise we have the general isopoincar´e tramnsforms, with corresponding definitions under isodualities The most salient difference between the special and general isotransforms is that the\nformer preserve the inertial charactyer of the frames, while the latter identify a broader class\nof noninertial frames Note that isodual parameters are independent of the conventional ones As a result, the\ngeneral invariance of isoseparation ( ) has 22–dimensions with structure\n\n\nˆ\nS dot = ˆP (3 1) |Iˆ × ˆP [d] (3 1) |Iˆ d (6 25)\n\n\nand the same result holds for the symmetry of the conventional Minkowskian separation as\na particular case The preceding analysis establishes the following property [4,7a]\n\n\nTheorem 2: The general isopoincar´e group is the universal isolinear invariance of all\ninfinitely possible, well behaved isoseparations (2 6) on the isominkowski space over isoreal fields with a common isounit\n\n\n33\n\n\nThe verification of the above theorem is trivial and can be done by just plotting the\nisotransforms in isoinvariant ( ) Note that there is nothing to compute, because the\ntheory provides the solution for the general invariance of the isoseparation for all infinitely\npossible isometrics in the diagonal form ˆη = T [ˆ] × η = diag (T µµ × η µµ ) One merely plots\nthe isotopic elements T µµ in the isotransforms The invariance of the isoseparation is then\nguaranteed by the isotopic methods Note the need for consistency that the generalized unit must be the same for the isospace\nand for the isofield This is not the case in conventional treatments where the unit of the\nspace is the unit matrix I = Diag (1, 1, ) and the unit of the field is the number +1 Nevertheless, the latter treatment can be easily reformulated for the same unit I Note also from the above studies that the abstract identity of the Poincar´e and isopoincar´e\nsymmetries implies that the special and isospecial relativity also coincide at the abstract\nlevel (and the same occurrence holds under isoduality) However, the special relativity has\nonly one formulation, the conventional one On the contrary, all isotopic structures, thus\nincluding the isospecial relativity, have two different formulations, one in isospace and the\nother in their projection in the conventional space All differences between the special and isospecial relativity solely occur when the latter\nis projected in the space–time of the former, because the isospecial relativity in isospace\npreserves all features of the conventional relativity, including the perfect light cone, the\nmaximal causal speed c 0, etc",
    "All differences between the special and isospecial relativity solely occur when the latter\nis projected in the space–time of the former, because the isospecial relativity in isospace\npreserves all features of the conventional relativity, including the perfect light cone, the\nmaximal causal speed c 0, etc [4] It should be also noted that that the general isopoincar´e symmetry does not restrict the\nvalue of n (except for the conditions n > 0) Thus, the isospecial relativity predicts arbitrary\ncausal speeds of light within homogeneous and isotropic media, because c can be smaller,\nequal or bigger than c 0 The case of light speeds smaller than c 0 is established in homogeneous and isotopic\nphysical media such as water Speeds bigger than c 0 have been identified in a number\nof cases, such as photons tunneling tests [15a,15d], expulsion of matter in astrophysical\nexplosions [15c,15d,15e], solutions of ordinary relativistic wave equations [15f] and other\n\ncases The isominkowskian space, the isopoincar´e symmetry and the isospecial relativity restore\nthe validity of the abstract axioms of the special relativity for arbitrary speeds of light,\nwhether smaller or bigger than c 0,because they are all projected in isospace into the unique\nand universal speed c 0, thus rendering the special relativity truly ”universal” It is remarkable that the two novel invariances (5 37)– (5 38) and (6 23)–(6 24) have\nremained undetected throughout this century, to our best knowledge This should not be\nsurprising because their detection required the prior discovery of new numbers, the isonumbers with arbitrary positive units for invariances (5 37) and (6 23) and the isodual numbers\nwith arbitrary negative units for invariances (5 38) and (6 24) 34\n\n\n## 7 Operator isominkowskian gravity for matter and its isodual for antimatter\n\nWe are now sufficiently equipped to identify the foundations of OIG and appraise its plausibility on comparative grounds with QG [12] A number of applications and verifications are\npresented in future works [4i] OIG was first presented in ref [8a] and preliminary studied\nin [8b,8c] The basic dynamical equations of OIG in their axiomatically correct form are\npresented in this paper for the first time following the achievement of mathematical maturity\nin memoir [3f] and axiomatic maturity in memoir [3g] We should indicate from the outset that the expectation of the existence of a ”quantum” description of gravity is disproved by ouur studies This is established by Theorem\n1 which identifies the classical noncanonical structure of gravity with a necessary nonunitary counterpart at the operator level, under which no ”quantum” law is expected to apply\nidentically In fact, QG requires notorious departures from a true ”quantum mechanical” setting and\nthe isotopic reformulation of gravity does not escape from the same occurrence The best\nthat can be done on ground of our current knowledge is a formulation of gravity via the\nabstract axioms of quantum mechanics, only realized in a more general form Equivalently we can say that the main idea of OIG is to turn the notorious ”nonunitary”\nstructure of the operator description of gravity on a conventional Hilbert space, into an\nidentical ”isounitary” formulation on our isohilbert space, thus regaining in this way the\nabstract axioms of RQM Alternatively, our studies indicate that no formulation of gravity appears to be possible\nvia the use of the quantum axioms in their simplest possible realization, that with the unit\n+1 On the contrary, if more general realizations are admitted, then realistic possibilities\nfor basic advances emerge",

of RQM is the Poincar´e symmety P(3 1) in operator\nrealization By the same token, the ultimate and most fundamental notion of the operator\ntheory herein submitted from which all properties and

with respect to the\ngravitational isounit I [ˆ] gr (x) The main characteristics of the emerging operator gravity are the following:\n\n\nProperty I: OIG is based on the embedding of gravity in the isotopic lifting of Planck’s\n\nconstant Recall that the Plank constant is the basic unit of RQM The fundamental isotopy of\nOIG is then precisely that of the latter, and we shall write\n\n\nh¯ = I → I [ˆ] gr (r), (7 3)\n\nwhere I [ˆ] gr (r) is the 3×3–dimensional space component of the 4×4–dimensional gravitational\nisounit I [ˆ] gr (x) The isotopic character of the lifting is readily established

transforms\nare of isotopic type To be more specific on this fundamental point, the appraisal of OIG with conventional\nQG notions, such as the magnitude of the angular momentum J [2] = J k × J [k] leads to a host\nof inconsistencies which are generally not detected by nonexpert in the field (e g , violation\nof isolinearity) Similarly, data elaborations via ordinary trigonometric functions or with\nthe familiar Dirac’s delta function have no meaning of any nature for OIG, because said\nconventional notions cannot be even defined in isospaces over isofields With a clear understanding to

“completion” of RQM much along the E–P–R argument [14] After all, gravity is\nembedded in the unit of RQM As such, the inclusion of gravity in RQM is so natural to\ncreep in un–noticed Also, property (7 17) establishes that one should not expect OIG to yield deviations\nfrom established quantum mechanical laws This occurrence is made clearer by the fact that\nthe uncertainties of the center–of–mass trajectories of a systems of particles obeying OIG\nare conventional In fact, from isocommutation rules ( ) we have (¯h = 1) [3g]\n\n\n\n∆r × ∆p ≥ [1]\n\n\n\n(7 18)\n2 [",

with ”isotopies” (Sect 2) The presence of gravitational IN OUR OIG is established by numerous aspects, all verifying conventional quantum laws, such as deviations from conventional quantum eigenvalues,\nor the resolution of the paradox of quantum mechanics at gravitational singularities [8d] (see\nbelow) The isorelativistic equations of OIG are uniquely identified by the isopoincar´e symmetry\nvia its isocasimir invariants (6 13) and related isorepresentation theory we cannot possibly\nstudy here for brevity (see the study of ref [44h,7a]) The first difference is that now

gravitational isounit I [ˆ] gr (x) Conceivable physical applications of this new setting will be studied elsewhere The ”isolinearization” of the second–order equation is done via a simple isotopy of

conventional Poincar´e symmetry in its spinorial covering\nP(3 1) = SL(2 c) × T (3 1) is the general symmetry of the conventional Dirac equation This\nbelief can be disproved by the isodual mathematics [5] In fact, we have the following\n\n\nTheorem 3: The largest possible isolinear symmetry of the isodirac equation is given\nby the isospinorial isopoincar´e symmetry in the following

therefore that it must also be isoselfdual for consistency The isospinorial Poincar´e symmetry P(3 1) is not isoselfdual, P [d] (3 1) ̸= P(3 1),\nand therefore does not verify the indicated necessary condition However the direct product\nS tot = P(3 1)×P [ˆ] [d] (3 1) is isoselfdual, S tot ≡ S tot [d] [, and therefore verifies this necessary con-]\ndition The sufficiency can be proved as in the conventional case Since the isotopies are\naxiom–preserving, the above properties of the conventional Dirac equation persists under\nall its infinitely possible isotopies, including the gravitational particularization Finally, the\n22-dimensional character of the total symmetry originates from the independence of conventional and isodual parameters, as well as the inclusion of the isoselfscalar transforms and\ntheir isoduals of Theorem 2 of Sect 6 q e d 39\n\n\nTheorem 3 can also be reached by an inspection of the conventional Dirac matrices\n\n–\nin Eq s ( ) and ( ) In fact the latter are

This illustrates that the birth of the isodual theories]\nfor antiparticles can be seen in the conventional Dirac’s equation because of the essential\npresence of a negative unit in the very structure of the gamma matrices The latter was not interpreted by Dirac as a bona–fide unit because he lacked the knowledge of the related new numbers with negative units, the isodual numbers [3e] Similarly, the space part of the conventional Dirac matrices reveals the presence of the isodual Pauli matrices, only written in our formalism σ [kd] = −σ k [†] [=][ −][σ] [k] [ The latter occurrence]\nhas intriguing implications, such as:\na) It establishes the validity of the isodual representation of antimatter In fact, the\nreferral of the negative–energy solutions to negative units eliminates their un–physical behavior [5];\nb) It establishes the insufficient character of current interpretation of P(3 1) as being the\nmaximal linear symmetry of the Dirac equations, in favor of the isoselfdual form P(3 1) ×\nP [d] (3 1) c) It disproves another popular belief according to which th spin in Dirac matrices is\ncharacterized by a 4 × 4–dimensional representation of SU(2) In fact, the treatment

    "The important\npoint is that the above local speed can be directly represented, that is, represented via the\ngeometric line element of the theory, rather than current indirect manipulations (e g g , the\nrepresentation of the classical speed c = c 0 /n via the scattering of photons among molecules\nin second quantization) As an example, it is well known that the representation of the locally varying character\nof the speed of light in interior conditions is not possible in the Schwarzschild’s geometry By\ncomparison, its representation becomes elementary under our isotopic extension to interior\nconditions, due to the lifting of the fourth component (here assuming F = I for simplicity)\n\n\nˆ\ng 44 → g 44 = g 44 /n [2] 4 [ ] (7 37)\n\n\nThe space components n [2] k [then emerge as the][ space–time symmetrization of the index of]\nrefraction, or via simple application of the Lorentz–Santilli isoboosts The isominkowskian reformulation of gravity also permits a novel and

− 2M/r) [−][1] = 0 (7 39)\nAs a result, rules (7 38) contain conventional horizons and singularities However, gravitational horizons and singularities are some of the most significant cases\nof interior gravitational problems, thus having nonlinear, nonlocal and nonlagrangian effects\nindicated in Sect 1 which are outside the representational capability of the Riemannian\ngeometry Rules (7 38) therefore permit novel studies on gravitational horizons and singularities with a more realistic inclusion of internal, velocity–dependent and nonlocal–integral\neffects which will be conducted elsewhere It should also be mentioned that gravitational horizons are today studied via the use\nof conventional light cones, which implies the assumption of light in vacuum c 0 But the\n\n\n42\n\n\nexterior of gravitational horizons is made up of hyperdense chromospheres in which the\nspeed of electromagnetic waves is a locally varying quantity The use of our isolight cone\nthen permits more realistic calculations with actual speeds of light, also contemplated in\nfuture works [5e] OIG also permits the resolution of the paradox of quantum mechanics for gravitational\ncollapse, identified and resolved in ref [5d] Consider a conventional QM particle in the\ninterior of a star As such, the particle obeys conventional uncertainties Suppose now\nthat the star collapses all the way to a singularity Then, the particle considered must be\nlocated at the singularity But the star is a classical object The location of its singularity\ncan therefore be classically determined with the desired precision The paradox of quantum\nmechanics here considered then follows, because the QM particle should have uncertainties\nat a point which is classically determined It seems evident that no known resolution of this paradox exists in ordinary RQM On\nthe contrary, OIG can indeed resolve the paradox In fact, the isoexpectation value of the\ncommutation rules reads\n\n\nˆˆ\n< [ˆr, p] >= [<][ | ×][ ˆ][T] [gr] [ ×][ (ˆ][r][ ×][ ˆ][T] [gr] [ ×][ p][ −] [p][ˆ][ ×][ ˆ][T] [gr] [ ×][ ˆ][r][)][ ×][ ˆ][T] [gr] [ × |][ >] (7 40)\n\n< | × T gr × | >\n\nwhere the numerator is of the 4–th order in T [ˆ] gr while the denominator is of the 1–st order From rule (5 30) it is then evident that\n\n\nLim(∆r × ∆p) ˆT gr →0 = 2 [1] [Lim][ <][ [ˆ][r,][ˆˆ][p][]][ >] [ ˆ][T] [gr] [→][0] [≡] [0][,] (7 41)\n\n\nnamely, the isouncertainties acquire their classical deterministic value at the limit of gravitational collapse to a singularity, which is the main result in of ref [5d] (other results in\nthe same papers should be reformulate with the subsequent isodifferential calculus to avieve\ninvariance, as done in this study) The above findings provide additional elements of plausibility for OIG and indicate that\nthe ”completion” of RQM for the inclusion of gravitation along the historical E–P–R teaching [14] is deeper that just the the achievement of an explicit operator realization of the\ntheory of ”hidden variables”, because it implies rather subtle revisions of current studies\non the relationship between classical and operator theories tacitly restricted to the simplest\npossible unit ¯h = 1 As an example, recall that OIG is an image of RQN under nonunitary transforms which,\nas such, are known not to preserve eigenvalues and boundary values It then follows that\nthe image of Bell’s inequalities which is applicable to OIG is necessarily given by a nonunitary image of the conventional forms [14d] This evidently implies the alteration of the\nnumerical value of the conventional upper boundary of the inequalities which, as such, can\nbecome indeed compatible with conventional classical counterparts for the interior problem\nonly (see [4h], App",
    "This evidently implies the alteration of the\nnumerical value of the conventional upper boundary of the inequalities which, as such, can\nbecome indeed compatible with conventional classical counterparts for the interior problem\nonly (see [4h], App 4 C for details, including the construction of the nonunitary image of\n\n\n43\n\n\nPauli’s matrices) Note the restriction, again, of the latter arguments to the interior classical and operator problems In fact, the exterior classical problem remains the conventional\nHamiltonian–unitary one In summary, we can state that, subject to further studies and independent scrutinies,\nOIG appears to resolve the problematic aspects of QG, i e , the lack of invariant unit with\nconsequential ambiguous applicability to measurements, the lack of conservation of Hermiticity in time with consequential lack of physically acceptable observables, the lack of invariance\nof the numerical predictions, physical laws and special functions with consequential lack of\nconsistent physical applications Moreover, QG is known to have difficulties in achieving a formulation comparable to ordinary RQM because of serious technical problems, e g , in the construction of PCT symmetry These difficulties are removed ab initio in OIG precisely thanks to its isotopic character, that\nis, the inherent capability of preserving all original characteristics, as illustrated above Besides the transparent axiomatic advantages of OIG as compared to QG, the plausibility\nof QIG is further established by preservation of conventional quantum laws, such as the\nconventional uncertainties for the center–of–mass trajectories, Eq Besides the transparent axiomatic advantages of OIG as compared to QG, the plausibility\nof QIG is further established by preservation of conventional quantum laws, such as the\nconventional uncertainties for the center–of–mass trajectories, Eq s (7 18)",
    "18) The latter property provide evident experimental support for our isominkowskian formulation of gravity, this time, at the operator level, because it indicates its compatibility with\nexisting, quantum mechanical experimental data, a property which does not appear to be\nverified by QG The understanding is that contributions at the particle level due to gravity\nare notoriously very small as compared to those due to other interactions, as established by\nisotopic elements of the Schwarzschild’s type (2 24) where M is now the mass of the particle\nconsidered These very small contributions can therefore be verified via suitable tests only\nafter achieving the necessary technology ### Acknowledgments\n\n\nThe autor would like to thank for invaluable comments the participants to: the 7 Marcel\nGrossmann Meeting on General Relativity held at Stanford university in July 1994; the\nInternational Workshops held at the Istituto per la Ricerca di Base in Molise, Italy, on\nAugust 1995 and May 1996; and the International Workshop on Physical Interpretation of\nRelativity Theories held at the Imperial College, London, on September 1996 Moreover,\nthe author would like to express his sincere appreciation to the Editors of Rendiconti Circolo\nMatematico Palermo, Foundations of Physics and Mathematical Methods in Applied Sciences,\nfor invaluable, penetrating and constructive critical comments in the editorial processing of\nthe respective memoirs [3f,3g,7a] without which this paper could not have seen the light 44\n\n\n## References\n\n\n[1] H A Lorentz, Amst Proc Proc 6, 809 (1904) [1a]; H Poincar´e, Compte Rendues, Paris 140,\n1504 (1905) [1b]; A Einstein, ANN Phys 17, 891 (1905) [1c]; H Minkowski, Nachr Ges Wiss G¨ottingen 43 (1908) [1d]; W Pauli, Theory of Relativity, Pergamon Press,\nNew York (1958) [1e]\n\n\n[2] B Riemann, G¨ott Nachr 13, 133 (1868) and Collected Works, H Weber, Editor, Dover,\nNew York (1953) [2a]; D Hilbert, Nachr Kgl Ges Wissench Gottingen, ((Akad Wissssench Berlin, 1915, p 844 [2c]; K",
