    "## Full-Vector Analysis of a Realistic Photonic Crystal Fiber\n\nA Ferrando [1], E Silvestre [1], J J Miret [1], M V Andr´es [2], and P Andr´es [1]\n\n\n1 Departament d’`Optica, Universitat de Val`encia E-46100 Burjassot (Val`encia), Spain 2 Institut de Ci`encia dels Materials, Universitat de Val`encia E-46100 Burjassot (Val`encia), Spain E-46100 Burjassot (Val`encia), Spain Abstract\n\n\nWe analyze the guiding problem in a realistic photonic crystal fiber us\n\ning a novel full-vector modal technique, a biorthogonal modal method based\n\n\non the nonselfadjoint character of the electromagnetic propagation in a fiber Dispersion curves of guided modes for different fiber structural parameters are\n\n\ncalculated along with the 2D transverse intensity distribution of the fundamen\n\ntal mode Our results match those achieved in recent experiments, where the\n\n\nfeasibility of this type of fiber was shown Our results match those achieved in recent experiments, where the\n\n\nfeasibility of this type of fiber was shown OCIS codes: 060 2270 fiber characterization,\n\n060 2280 fiber design and fabrication,\n\n060 2430 fibers, single mode 1\n\n\nPeriodic dielectric structures (photonic crystals) have raised a growing interest\n\n\nin the last years because they exhibit very interesting optical features The most\n\n\nrelevant property of a photonic crystal is the possibility of generating photonic band\n\n\ngaps for certain geometries [1] This effect has been observed in both 2D and 3D\n\n\nstructures in the form of absence of light propagation for a specific set of frequencies\n\n\n(see Ref [2] and references therein) [2] and references therein) A related phenomenon occurring in photonic\n\n\ncrystal structures is light localization at defects Although the previous phenomena were first observed and analyzed in bulk struc\n\ntures, there exists a connected effect of potential interest for light propagation in\n\n\ndielectric crystals which have a 2D periodicity in the x-y plane broken by the pres\n\nence of a defect, but are continuous in the z direction The physical realization of such\n\n\na structure is what is called a photonic crystal fiber This is a thin silica fiber having a\n\n\nregular structure of holes that extend themselves along the whole fiber length If one\n\n\nof these holes is absent, the transverse dielectric periodicity gets broken and a defect\n\n\nappears The fact that light may be trapped at defects turns here into a propagation\n\n\nfeature Consequently, the bound states of the 2D transverse problem (2D trapped\n\n\nstates of light) become the guided modes of the fiber propagation problem The\n\n\nexperimental feasibility of these fibers has been proven recently [3] A preliminary\n\n\ninterpretation of their behavior involving the concept of effective refractive index is\n\n\npresented in Ref [4]",
    "[4] A robust single-mode structure was observed for an unusually\n\n\nwide range of wavelengths, a very remarkable property not present in ordinary fibers Our interest lies in giving an appropriate treatment of the realistic problem of\n\n\na photonic crystal fiber by modeling and solving efficiently its transverse 2D struc\n\n2\n\n\nture We next proceed to present an approach in which the full-vector character of\n\n\nlight propagation in fibers is taken into account It is an adapted version of our\n\n\nbiorthonormal-basis modal method [5] In this way, a realistic 2D periodic structure\n\n\nwith a central defect is properly implemented allowing us to analyze different fiber\n\n\ndesigns As we will see, our results agree with those experimentally measured and,\n\n\nat the same time, predict different interesting behaviors for some particular designs As we will see, our results agree with those experimentally measured and,\n\n\nat the same time, predict different interesting behaviors for some particular designs Guided modes in an inhomogeneous fiber verify a set of dimensionally reduced\n\n\nequations involving the transverse coordinates x and y exclusively [6] This set of\n\n\nequations is obtained from Maxwell’s equations by assuming the electromagnetic field\n\n\nto be monochromatic in time and to have a harmonic dependence on z (i e , the field\n\n\nhas a well-defined propagation constant β) In terms of the transverse components of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [and][ e] [t] [ =]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [, these equations can]\n\n\n\nthe magnetic and electric field, h t =\n\n\nbe rewritten as [5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh x\n\n\nh\ny\n\n\n\ne x\n\n\ne\ny\n\n\n\nLh t = β [2] h t, L [†] e¯ t = β [∗][2] e¯ t (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [,][ L] [†] [ is the adjoint operator of][ L][,] [ ∗] [denotes the complex conjugate]\n\n\n\nwhere ¯e t =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne [∗]\ny\n\n\n−e [∗] x\n\n\n\noperation, and each element L ρσ of the matrix differential operator L has the form\n\n\nL ρσ ≡ (∇ [2] + k [2] n [2] )δ ρσ − (ǫ ρτ ∇ τ n [2] ρ, σ, τ, υ = x, y, (2)\n\nn [2] [ )(][ǫ] [συ] [∇] [υ] [)][,]\n\n\nwhere ǫ ρσ is the completely antisymmetric tensor in 2D, n the refractive index, and\n\n\nk the free-space wave number Of course, ∇ [2] is the Laplacian operator and ∇ σ\n\n\nthe transverse components of the gradient operator Let us notice that the general\n\n\nproblem of light propagation in a fiber, even for nonabsorbing materials (when n [2] is\n\n\n3\n\n\nL real), involves the nonhermitian operator\n\n\nThe most relevant property of Eq (1) is that it constitutes a system of eigenvalue\n\n\nequations for the L operator and its adjoint L [†] (something that it is far from obvious\n\n\nwhen one starts from the reduced equations written in terms of h t and e t —instead\n\n\nof ¯e t —, see, for instance, Ref [6])",
    "[6]) This feature is crucial in our approach to the\n\n\nfull-vector problem Because h t and ¯e t are the eigenfunctions of the L and L [†] oper\n\nators, respectively, they are closely related In fact, they verify what it is called the\n\n\nbiorthogonality relation, ⟨e¯ [n] t [|][h] [m] t [⟩] [=][ δ] [nm] [ [7] The biorthonormality property of the]\n\n\n{L, L [†] } eigenfunctions, {h [m] t [,][ ¯][e] [n] t [}][, guarantees the expansion of any squared integrable]\n\n\nfunction in terms of either the L or the L [†] eigenfunctions, in complete analogy with\n\n\nthe hermitian case For the same reason, matrix elements can always be defined in\n\n\nterms of the “biorthogonal modes” of an arbitrary {L, L [†] } system The main goal of our approach is to transform the problem of solving the system\n\n\nof differential equations (1) (including highly non trivial boundary conditions some\n\ntimes) into an algebraic problem involving the diagonalization of the L-matrix The\n\n\nspectrum of the L-matrix will be formed in general by 2D bound states and contin\n\nuum states In terms of fiber propagation, the bound states of the L spectrum are\n\n\nguided modes since, despite the finite width of the fiber, the fields exhibit a strong\n\n\ndecay in the transverse direction On the contrary, states from the continuum radiate\n\n\nradially and thus are not guided by the fiber On the contrary, states from the continuum radiate\n\n\nradially and thus are not guided by the fiber The choice of an appropriate auxiliary basis is very important for an efficient\n\n\nimplementation of our method In the particular case of a photonic crystal fiber\n\n\nthis election must be specially accurate The main reason is that the complicated\n\n\n4\n\n\nspatial structure of the refractive index in a realistic case can transform the actual\n\n\ncomputation of the L-matrix elements into an impossible task Realistic simulations\n\n\nmust contemplate as many as nearly one hundred 2D step-index individual structures\n\n\n(the air holes of the photonic crystal fiber) Therefore, a brute force computation of\n\n\nthe matrix elements becomes useless in practice due to critical loss of precision The implementation of the dielectric structure is carried out by putting the system\n\n\nin a finite 2D box (of dimensions D x and D y ) and requiring the fields to fulfill periodic\n\n\nboundary conditions in the x and y directions So, we create an artificial lattice by\n\n\nreplicating the original almost periodic structure, including the central defect, in\n\n\nboth transverse directions This new superlattice is made of copies of the original cell\n\n\ncovering the whole two dimensional transverse plane Although the original cell is\n\n\nnot periodic, the whole superlattice really is The periodicity requirement implies we\n\n\ncan expand the 2D electromagnetic fields in a discrete Fourier series in terms of plane\n\n\nwaves determined by the exponential functions f ⃗n (⃗x t ) = exp(i [⃗] k ⃗n - ⃗x t ), where [⃗] k ⃗n =\n\n\n\n\n[n] [x]\n\nD x [,] [ n] D [y]\n\n\n\n2π( D [n] [x]\n\n\n\n\n[y]\n\nD y [) is the discretized transverse wave vector This is equivalent to say we are]\n\n\n\nchoosing the {f ⃗n (⃗x t )} set as the auxiliary basis of our Hilbert space necessary to define\n\n\nthe matrix elements of the L-operator (note that the f ⃗n functions are orthogonal) A crucial property of the above plane-wave basis is that, due to periodicity of\n\n\nthe superlattice and despite it is defined in a finite volume —the unit cell of the\n\n\nsuperlattice of size D x times D y —, it is translationally invariant The presence of\n\n\nthis symmetry shown by our auxiliary basis turns out critical for the feasibility of the\n\n\nmethod The advantage of the translation symmetry is twofold On the one hand,\n\n\nit allows us to relate easily any matrix element of the operator representing a hole\n\n\n5\n\n\nat an arbitrary position with that representing a hole at the origin of coordinates Since the whole matrix of the photonic crystal fiber structure can be written as a sum\n\n\nover all matrices representing each one of the substructures (holes), and since these\n\n\nsubstructures are identical (although differently located), it is possible to reduce the\n\n\nproblem to the calculation of one single matrix On the other hand, the calculation\n\n\nof any element of this single matrix can be worked out analytically in this basis (we\n\n\nassume a circular step-index profile for the hole) On top of that, and because of\n\n\nthe symmetry properties of a realistic hexagonally-centered configuration of holes,\n\n\nthe sum over the set of points where the holes are located can also be analytically\n\n\nsolved Consequently, the choice of periodic plane waves of the superlattice as a basis\n\n\nto define the matrix elements of the realistic photonic fiber operator L leads to a\n\n\ncrucial simplification The problem of critical loss of precision due to the complex\n\n\nspatial structure of the photonic crystal fiber is, in this way, overcome We have simulated a realistic photonic crystal fiber characterized by a hexagonal\n\n\ndistribution of air holes with a central defect The hole radius a, the horizontal dis\n\ntance between the center of two consecutive holes —or pitch— Λ, and the wavelength\n\n\nof light λ are free parameters that we have changed at will The height of the refrac\n\ntive index step is also free, although we have kept it constant for comparison purposes We have simulated first a realistic air-filled fiber with parameters a = 0 3 µm and\n\n\nΛ = 2 3 µm We have focussed on this particular design because the intensity distri\n\nbution for the guided mode in this structure has been measured experimentally for a\n\n\nwavelength of λ = 632 8 nm Experimental measures also show that the guided mode\n\n\nin this fiber remains single in a remarkably wide wavelength range, extending from\n\n\n6\n\n\n337 nm to 1550 nm [3] Our simulation allows us to evaluate the eigenvalues of the\n\n\nL-operator at any wavelength and thus to calculate the modal dispersion curves for\n\n\nthe fiber under consideration in an even wider range of wavelengths (see Fig 1)",
    "1) The\n\n\nsingle-mode structure is formed by a polarization doublet Our results completely\n\n\nagree with the previous experimental results as they account for the existence of a\n\n\nrobust single-mode structure nearly at all wavelengths for the above fiber parameters Our results completely\n\n\nagree with the previous experimental results as they account for the existence of a\n\n\nrobust single-mode structure nearly at all wavelengths for the above fiber parameters We include in Fig 1 the envelope of the radiation modes which is refered to as the\n\n\ncladding index (i e the effective refractive index of the photonic crystal) Since the diagonalization procedure of the full-vector operator L generates not\n\n\nonly the set of eigenvalues but also their respective eigenvectors, we can also evaluate\n\n\nthe transverse intensity distribution of the electromagnetic field for the guided mode The result for one of the polarizations is shown in Fig 2 for λ = 632 8 nm and\n\n\nreproduces, with excellent accuracy, that experimentally measured [3] We have also\n\n\ncalculated the transverse intensity of the guided mode at very different wavelengths\n\n\nand for both polarizations In all cases, the intensity profile is very similar to that\n\n\nshown in Fig In all cases, the intensity profile is very similar to that\n\n\nshown in Fig 2 2 In this way, we have checked the robust character of the single mode\n\n\nstructure under changes in the wavelenght of light This fact agrees with the behavior\n\n\nof the dispersion curves mentioned previously Besides simulating this remarkable structure, we have also simulated a number of\n\n\ndifferent fiber designs by changing the pitch Λ and the hole radius a By analyzing the\n\n\ndispersion curves of these differently fibers, we have found a richer modal structure\n\n\nin some of them In the example shown in Fig 3 there exist, besides the fundamental\n\n\ndoublet, two other polarization doublets Unlike conventional fibers, the number\n\n\n7\n\n\nof modes does not increase with the light wave number k The number of guided\n\n\nmodes gets stabilized above a k-threshold, or equivalently it remains constant for\n\n\nwavelengths smaller than a threshold wavelength For particular designs one can get\n\n\nguiding structures in which this constant number is just one In such a case one\n\n\nobtains and “endlessly” single-mode fiber as the one reported in Ref",
    "In such a case one\n\n\nobtains and “endlessly” single-mode fiber as the one reported in Ref [3] [3] This is a\n\n\nvery unconventional property shown by photonic crystal fibers In a conventional fiber, the cladding refractive index is nearly constant and then\n\n\nits V-value, the optical “volume” (or phase space) of the fiber, grows with k This fact\n\n\npermits to accommodate an increasing number of guided modes inside the fiber as the\n\n\nwavelength is reduced In a photonic crystal fiber the periodic structure responsible\n\n\nfor light trapping at the central defect creates a dependence on the effective refractive\n\n\nindex of the cladding such that a much more weakly k-dependent V-value is generated The optical “volume” becomes then practically independent of the wavelength for\n\n\nlarge values of k and, consequently, so do the number of guided modes The optical “volume” becomes then practically independent of the wavelength for\n\n\nlarge values of k and, consequently, so do the number of guided modes Financial support from the Generalitat Valenciana (grant GV96-D-CN-05-141) is\n\n\nacknowledged 8\n\n\n## References\n\n\n[1] E Yablonovitch, J Opt Soc Am B 10, 283 (1993) [2] P St J Russell, T A Birks, and F D Lloyd-Lucas, in Confined Electrons and\n\n\nPhotons, E Burstein and C Weisbuch, eds (Plenum Press, New York, 1995), p 585 [3] J C Knight, T A Birks, P St J Russell, and D M Atkin, Opt Lett 21, 1547\n\n\n(1996); Opt Lett 22, 484 (1997) [4] T A Birks, J C Knight, and P St J Russell, Opt Lett 22, 961 (1997) [5] E Silvestre, M V Andr´es, and P Andr´es, J Lightwave Technol 16, 923 (1998) [6] A W Snyder and J D Love, Optical Waveguide Theory (Chapman and Hall,\n\n\nLondon, 1983), pp 595-606 [7] P M Morse and H Feshbach, Methods of Theoretical Physics, part I (McGraw\n\nHill, New York, 1953), pp 884-886 9\n\n\n## Figure captions\n\n\n  - Figure 1 9\n\n\n## Figure captions\n\n\n  - Figure 1 Modal dispersion curves extending from λ = 300 nm to λ = 1600 nm\n\n\nfor a single-mode photonic crystal-fiber structure with a = 0 3 µm and Λ =\n\n\n2 3 µm 3 µm In this plot, the variation of the mode index for both polarizations\n\n\ncoalesce in a single curve - Figure 2 - Figure 2 Transverse intensity distribution for the x-polarized guided mode of\n\n\nthe photonic crystal fiber described in Fig 1 for λ = 632 8 nm - Figure 3 Same as in Fig 1 but with a = 0 6 µm 6 µm Here, the two higher order\n\n\npolarization doublets are slightly shifted each other Here, the two higher order\n\n\npolarization doublets are slightly shifted each other 10\n\n\n1 460\n\n\n1 455\n\n\n1 450\n\n\n1 445\n\n\n1 440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\nnormalized frequency: L / [l]\n\n\n\nA Ferrando et al Fig 1\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2 -1 0 1 2\n\n\n\ndimensionless coordinate: x\n\n\n\n\n\nA Ferrando et al Fig 2\n\n\n1 46\n\n\n1 44\n\n\n1 42\n\n\n1 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nnormalized frequency: L / [l]\n\n\n\nA Ferrando et al Fig 3"
