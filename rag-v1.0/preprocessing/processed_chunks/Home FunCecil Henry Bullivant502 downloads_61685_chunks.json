    "It can be made from two equal widths of some\nserviceable material such as dark cretonne, supported by brass rings\non a stout bamboo rod, to either end of which are attached large steel\neyes (A, A, Fig 1) Fig 1 —Back view of drop curtain The bamboo rod should be cut to such a length that when the eyes\nhave been added, the whole can be fixed to steel hooks screwed into\nthe picture-molding on either side of the room Should any difficulty\nbe experienced in procuring a rod of sufficient length, the difficulty\nmay be overcome by the use of two shorter pieces joined at the\nmiddle by iron sockets In the case where it is intended to give the performance in either a\nschoolroom or a small hall, a curtain of much greater size and of\nstouter material would be required, and this latter can be supported\non a length of strong gas pipe held in position by brackets nailed to\nthe wall at each end The arrangement for raising or lowering the curtain is shown in the\ndiagram, in which A A is the rod A number of small brass rings are\nthen sewn to the back of the curtain, as at A X and A E Top rings,\nmuch larger, are also attached to the curtain and passed along the\n\n\nrod Cord is next run from X and E respectively through the rings at A,\nand allowed to hang loose as at D The bottom of the curtain should\nbe weighted with shot Four screens, two on each side, can also be requisitioned for the\nwings, and a small steady table placed in each recess (Fig 1a) for\nmoderator lamps—preferably of the self-extinguishing pattern, in case\nthey should be upset by an untoward accident—to make up for the\ndeficiency of footlights, though these can be provided by the aid of a\nlittle ingenuity, e g candle reading-lamps with shades and reflectors\nbegged or borrowed from accommodating neighbors Tin cans cut in\nhalf, and night-lights will serve the purpose equally well",
    "Tin cans cut in\nhalf, and night-lights will serve the purpose equally well Here, again,\nthe inventive genius of the promoters of the enterprise will have to be\ncalled into play Here, again,\nthe inventive genius of the promoters of the enterprise will have to be\ncalled into play Fig 1a —Showing arrangement of screens for exits and entrances —Showing arrangement of screens for exits and entrances All risk of fire should be obviated as much as possible, and\nappliances for the swift extinction of a blaze near at hand By the judicious arrangement of the screens it will be possible to\nprovide for exits and entrances on both sides of the stage Home-made Scenery\nScenery, as a rule, proves a great barrier to the would-be promoters\nof amateur theatrical enterprises The purchase of suitable\nsurroundings for the presentation of various scenes is a luxury only to\nbe indulged in by the well-to-do In fact, to carry out an ordinary play\non these lines involves the expenditure of many dollars It is hoped\nthat the practical instructions given here will not only avoid such\nunnecessary and perhaps unwarrantable expense, but will also tend\ngreatly to increase the interest of those taking part in the work Where scenery is required, it is as well to confine oneself to a play\nthat takes place indoors, though, of course, it is possible even without\na back-drop to give a praiseworthy presentment of an open-air scene\nby means of a plain background, against which are fastened boughs of\ntrees, while the judicious grouping of greenhouse plants can be used\nat the sides, plus a plain green felt underfoot to add to the effect However, even these small items run away with money Cut boughs\n\n\nfade and need replacing, and this mode of constructing scenery will\noften be found by the would-be economist to cost more than he can\nreasonably afford Of course, for those who care to do so, proper mounted scenery all\nready for use may be purchased, but undoubtedly the better plan is\nfor the stage-manager to endeavor to find from amongst the members\nof his company one or two who are expert in the use of tools Generally there are many such available, and by the aid of the\nfollowing diagrams and explanatory notes a most useful interior box\nscene (comprising five “flats” which fit together and form the whole)\ncan be constructed at a cost certainly not exceeding $5 00",
    "00 By repapering and making other obvious alterations, such scenery\ncan be transformed as necessity demands to suit any particular play—\nthat is to say, the addition of a few hangings and pictures, and the\nsubstitution of other appropriate furniture will speedily change a poor\nman’s kitchen or parlor into quite a presentable stage drawing-room How to Make the “Flats”\nTo deal first with the “flats” or separate parts of the scenery The\nprimary essentials for these are a number of lengths of 21⁄2-inch\nbattening; other requisites being a plenitude of nails of all sizes, glue,\nbrown paper or canvas, powdered color, and size The purpose of this\nlatter commodity is for painting the wood-work or any other desired\narticle, such as a sideboard, dresser, or fireplace Cut the battening to lengths appropriate to the dimensions of the\nstage, or, in other words, with due regard to the height of the room\nand the width and depth of the platform Fig 2 shows the general arrangement of the five “flats,” placed in\nthe order shown, with the largest one, consisting of the double doors,\nin the center Now, as the width of these “flats” depends entirely upon the space\nthey occupy when put into the position indicated by the diagram, the\nstage carpenter must commence his plan of construction with this fact\nclearly in mind Should a particularly large stage be available, then it\nmay be desirable to extend the scenery, in which case one or more\nstraight “flats,” similar to that numbered 4 in Fig 2, can be added at\neach end or where desired Fig 2 —Showing usual arrangement of flats Fig 3 —Construction of “flat” containing door Fig 4 —Flat for window opening The frame-work for the respective “flats” appears in Figs 3, 4, 5,\nand 6, the method of joining corners being indicated by the elevation\nand sectional drawing depicted in the corner of Fig 5",
    "5 The vertical\nand horizontal supports are merely fitted in flush and glued For doors\nand window openings a slightly stouter battening will be found\nnecessary For doors\nand window openings a slightly stouter battening will be found\nnecessary Fig Fig 3 gives a clear idea of the main lines of construction of a\npractical door, which is to be fixed to the “flat” by means of hinges When hingeing doors, take particular care so to place the hinges that\nthe doors swing outwards—that is, from the point of view of the\naudience This precaution obviates the necessity of painting both sides\nof the doors A reference to Fig 4 shows a window opening which can be used\neither as a lattice, working on the same principle as the door, or as an\nordinary window, which can be suggested by gluing a strip of wood\nhorizontally across the center Detail\nFig 5 —Flat for double doors Fig 6 —Plain flat In Fig 5 the central opening (the double doors of the plan) serves\nfor curtains fixed to rods by means of sliding rings, or merely as\nFrench windows Of all the “flats,” this is the most valuable, because\nit is capable of utilization in a multitude of ways For instance, should\n\n\nthe scene be an elaborate drawing-room, the opening will lend itself\nto French windows, through which can be seen park-land or gardens\nin the distance Again, for the presentment of a humble apartment, it\nhas only to be covered with a dresser or any other commonplace\narticle of furniture Should an opening be required to another room,\ncurtains of course can be hung",
    "Should an opening be required to another room,\ncurtains of course can be hung Fig 6 depicts a plain “flat ”\nThe next operation is the covering of the frames, accomplished by\nthe use of brown paper, or, should expenses permit, of canvas The\nbrown paper is first cut to the size required, and then glued to the\nframes, only the openings for windows and doors being left If canvas\nis chosen for the covering, nailing will be found necessary To prevent\nsagging, and to preserve the flat appearance of the material, coat\nthinly and evenly with a solution of size and water Papering\nThe next item for consideration is papering A visit to almost any\npaperhanger’s will reveal the fact, that the shopman possesses\nquantities of certain designs, perhaps not quite large enough to be of\npractical service to him for papering a room In this circumstance the\nstage carpenter should be able, by the expenditure of a few cents, or a\nquarter at the outside, to obtain quite enough for his purpose Next,\nhe can procure from any builder’s yard a few lengths of architrave or\nbeaded edging for doorways and windows This will have to be\nmitered and fixed to the frames A few slips of board, with beading\nalong one edge, should also be purchased at the same time for fixing\nto the bottom of the frames to form the skirting Now paste the wall-\npaper to the frames Fig 7 —Complete door with section Fig 8 —Flat 1 or 5 converted into exterior cottage door Having satisfactorily constructed all the “flats,” fix them together in\n\n\nthe order shown in the plan—i e each to each—by means of pieces of\nbent zinc and screws Additional supports are often required, such as\niron brackets screwed to the bottom of the “flat” and the floor, as\nindicated by the crosses in Figs 3 and 5",
    "3 and 5 To give a finished effect, paste brown paper over the whole of the\ndoor frames, and produce the appearance of panels by the addition of\nmitered thin beading or slips of wood (Fig 7) The door panels may\nthen be painted according to taste with a mixture of any powdered\ncolor and dissolved size The fixing of a knob or handle with a long\nscrew renders the thing complete Reference to the plan marked Fig 2 reveals the fact, that the two\nend “flats” (1 and 5 respectively) are alike Now, while one of these\n“flats” may be utilized for an interior door (Fig 3), it may be found\nextremely useful so to prepare its fellow that it represents an exterior\ncottage door, and to use it as a wing at one side of the stage in\nanother scene It should then appear as in Fig 8 8 To obtain this result,\na section of scenery has to be covered with brown paper or canvas, as\nalready described for the interior door Should canvas be decided\nupon, first prepare it by adding a coating of mixed size and whiting,\nto form a background for the painted design In this case the door\nitself is covered on the outside with paper, and lines are drawn down\nto give an idea of planks nailed vertically together A latch-handle can\neither be purchased and fixed for a few cents, or an imitation one\npainted in The lintel and doorposts are constructed by gluing or nailing\nbattening of a sufficiently stout nature, that it projects to the degree\nindicated by the section in Fig",
    "The lintel and doorposts are constructed by gluing or nailing\nbattening of a sufficiently stout nature, that it projects to the degree\nindicated by the section in Fig 8 The purpose of this latter projection\nis to allow for the addition of a latticed porch, which will give that\npicturesqueness so essential to stage scenery Making a Portable Porch\nA glance at Fig 9 will put the amateur stage carpenter in full\npossession of all details relating to the construction of this latticed\nporch Of course, it will be found necessary to make two pieces of the\npart numbered 1—i e the batten frame and cross-pieces—as one will\nbe fixed on either side of the door to support the roof The lattice-\nwork may be purchased in a length, or made from laths, and nailed to\nthe frame Fix the sides of the porch close up to the doorposts by\n\n\nmeans of zinc brackets and pins, as indicated by the two crosses Next\npin on the roof, as at 4, Fig 9 Paint the finished porch bright green\nand the roof red Paint the finished porch bright green\nand the roof red A second reference to Fig 8 shows that it suggests a design of\nbricks, covered with creeper or a tree If necessary, treat the other\nside of the window “flat,” by painting it in similar fashion, and fix it\nalongside the door to form an additional wing A Portable Fireplace\nA very useful adjunct to the plain “flat” (Fig 6) is a portable\nfireplace, which is depicted in detail in Fig 10",
    "10 To make this, buy a\nlength or so of 3⁄4-inch planking, one length of which should be cut\nfor the mantelpiece, according to the size required Next cut two\nsupports of equal dimensions to form the sides (A, A, in elevation) These are nailed to the “flat,” and the mantelpiece is kept in position\nby two solid wooden brackets (D, D) Two slips are also added to the\nbase of the supports at E, E The piece C is let in flush with A, A Fig 9 —Construction of portable porch Fig 10 —Portable fireplace and grate Below this, to the back of the rectangular opening, attach a piece of\nvery stout blackened cardboard, of the shape shown, leaving an\nopening for a real or a painted grate (F) Should the former be\npreferred, it may be produced from pieces of thin battening, as shown\nin the elevation and section To obtain a realistic effect, fill the grate with non-inflammable\nmetal tinsel (C, C), and further to enhance the realism, support a\nsmall galley-pot on a blackened bracket or block of wood (A), the\ngalley-pot being filled with cotton-wool soaked in methylated spirit The application of a match produces a flame at B (see section of grate,\nFig 10) A Movable Counter or Sideboard\nFig 11 gives the front and back view of this very useful piece of\nstage furniture, which may be utilized either as a counter, sideboard,\nor bottom of a dresser; or, appropriately draped and surmounted by a\nlooking-glass, it may serve as a dressing-table Fig 11 —Portable counter or sideboard Fig 12 —Detached parts of counter or sideboard The sections are illustrated in Fig 12, the pieces marked 1 forming\nthe sides, 2 the top, and 3 the front Steel eyes are numbered 4, and\ntheir purpose is to hold the sides, front, and top together by strong\ncord, attached as in the back view of Fig 11 5 in Fig 12 is a\nprojecting panel, also seen in the front view of Fig 11 6 (Fig 12)\nindicates the back supports to which the front joined boards are\nnailed The beading which is fixed along three sides of the top is seen\nat 7 (Fig 13) Having thoroughly grasped the details outlined above, commence to\nmake the sideboard from 3⁄4-inch boarding To each of the side-pieces add a bottom support of stouter material,\nmarked with a cross in Fig 12 The front is next placed across the\nsupports in such a position that the top fits down on them and holds\nall three pieces in place (See dotted line at 7, Fig 13; this diagram\nalso depicts the separate pieces in elevation )\nIt is not worth while “spoiling the ship for a ha’p’orth o’ tar,” or, in\nthis instance, the sideboard for a coat of paint Before applying this\nlatter, paste the structure over with brown paper, and then give it a\ncoating of yellow ochre and size A grained appearance may be\nproduced by utilizing an old coarse comb, the fine grain being\nattained with the thin teeth and the coarse grain with the stout To\nobtain the graining, proceed as follows: on the dry coating of yellow\nochre put a second coating of dark brown ochre, mixed with size as\nbefore, and whilst wet comb in zigzag lines Fig 13 —The separate pieces in elevation The great advantage attaching to all the scenery and artificial\nfurniture described is that it can be easily fitted together, taken to\npieces, and packed flat, thus occupying a minimum of space For\npractical purposes it will be found quite equal both in appearance and\nfor durability to that for which many dollars are charged at a\ntheatrical supply dealer’s A Back-Cloth\nThe construction of home-made theatrical effects may be closed\nwith brief hints regarding the much-needed and ever-useful back-\ncloth, which plays a part in most exterior scenes, such as park lands,\ngardens, &c It consists of several lengths of calico joined together to\nform a square of the size required This is then fixed on a large\nwooden roller with a similar roller at the bottom to weight it, and\nprepared with a coating of size and whiting A friend of unquestionable artistic ability should be asked to paint\nin a view or other scenery In scene-painting bear in mind that only the brightest and most\nvivid colors are to be used The colors are made from powder mixed\nwith size, and must be applied with broad touches for distant effects The back-cloth can be fixed according to the means available For the proscenium, three pieces of wood to suit breadth and size of\nstage must be requisitioned, the portion destined for the top being\ngently sloped from an arch or apex in direct line with the center of the\ncurtain, and covered with some tastefully-colored paper which gives\nthe appearance of heavy satin panels A sewing bee should be formed among the ladies interested in the\ncompany, and she who has sufficient prowess with her scissors should\nbe chosen to cut the garments and superintend the needlework of her\nfriends This will prove a profitable way of spending the long winter\nafternoons Imitation hair wigs, beards, &c , may be procured at various prices The best plan to adopt in finding a play suited to the limitations of\nmaterial of an embryo company is to spend a small sum on some\n“Guide to Selecting Plays ” In these pages will be found abundant\n\n\nsuggestions and explanations of specimens, dealing from the simplest\none-act, thirty minutes’ production to the five-act, three hours’ drama The outline of each plot is given, and a summary of the dramatis\npersonæ required Miss Keating’s “Plot of Potzentausend,” for example, is an excellent\none-act play, in which only male characters are required Interest in\nthe fair sex is, however, cleverly maintained, for the four swains have\neach a lass to occupy their affections The costumes, a description of which is given on the front page, are\nof the time of Louis XIV , and the scene is a small frontier village in\nGermany This is an admirable, amusing, and not too ambitious\nperformance for boys home for the holidays Grindstone is a miller of a sour and unfriendly disposition He is\nsecretly involved in small political intrigues, and, in order to meet the\nChevalier d’Espion without the knowledge of the villagers, refuses to\nallow the lads and lasses their usual yearly privilege of dancing in his\nbarn, to which they naturally take exception Grindstone’s personality\nand physical appearance are as gray, grim, and cold as the substance\nafter which he is named He is tight of lip, thin of figure, and\npossessed of a countenance which expresses a miserly cunning, dislike\nof frivolities, and hypocritical semblance of virtue Although vastly\nrespected, he is not overwhelmed with the affections of his fellow-\nmen, and is termed, even by his servant Sacks, to be something of a\nrogue Sacks, his man, is a thick-set hunchback, with a round, jolly face\nand optimistic temperament, which presents a strong contrast to his\nmaster’s saturnine character Max, a young sergeant, of smart demeanor, is weighted by a sense\nof his own importance, insipid of face, and overbearingly superior in\nmanners Louis, a lawyer’s clerk, pale and meek, rat-faced and rather wily,\ngrasping in disposition, and something of a flirt Fritz, a young peasant, whose sentences generally terminate with\n“as a body may say,” shows a priggish and cautious attitude to\npreserve his own skin at any cost His expression is a delightful\nmixture of rustic placidity and guileless cunning The Chevalier d’Espion, a smart, condescending person of uncertain\nage and carefully preserved complexion; his gold lace and feathers\nlend him as irreproachable an aloofness and pride as the peacock\n\n\ndemonstrates towards the jackdaw Plan of Room in Grindstone’s House\nThe table should be covered with a cloth sufficiently long to touch\nthe ground on all sides The rear of the high-backed chair and\nwindow-curtain are to be used as hiding-places, and must be\npracticable for the purpose Small chairs and an old stool are also\nrequired Except for a small lighted lamp which Sacks, the first to\nenter, places on the table, the stage is in darkness This play takes thirty-five minutes The plot is built on the\nmisunderstanding that arises between the four swains—who have\nunconsciously chosen the same place and hour to meet their ladies—\nand the Chevalier d’Espion, who, expecting to find a quartette of\nfellow-conspirators, mistakes them for such in disguise Soldiers\nappear to arrest the Chevalier, who manages to escape Sacks proves\nthe identity of the rest, and so all ends happily The dialogue must be brisk and the action kept interesting Acted in\nthe right spirit, it cannot fail to produce roars of merriment It has a\nfurther advantage of not being too great a strain on the memorizing\npowers of those who have never previously essayed to learn prose by\nheart A reliable prompter, concealed from the audience, should be close\nat hand His business is to follow the dialogue intently, giving aid\nwhen necessary in a clear, low voice Words should never be\nwhispered, nor too loudly spoken A happy medium is acquired by\nexperience The make-up required by the characters is as\nfollows:—\nSacks (florid flesh tint), grease paint (red) No 21⁄2; a slight cobweb\nof good-natured wrinkles and crowsfeet, such as would be caused by\nlaughter Red, black, or gray wig, according to taste Grindstone (sallow flesh tint), chrome grease paint; peevish and\ndiscontented lines about the mouth, furrowed forehead, peruke\nslightly gray, nose paste to enlarge nose, sparse ruffled

    "The cheek-bone, nose, chin, and brow are parts of the face which\nare made up for high lights, though if wrinkles are to be accentuated\nthis is usually done by the addition of a “high light” effect on each\nside of the existing dark line (Figs 1b and 1c) Fig 1a —High lights Fig 1b —High lights Fig 1c —High lights —High lights To make cheeks appear hollow, gray-lining paint is used, the effect\nof emaciation being produced by the careful blending of the last-\nnamed paint with the grease paint previously put on To make cheeks appear hollow, gray-lining paint is used, the effect\nof emaciation being produced by the careful blending of the last-\nnamed paint with the grease paint previously put on Fig 2 —Low lights Shadows, or low lights, give the effect of hollowed cheeks and\nsunken eyes, and instead of making features more pronounced, as is\nthe case with a careful “high light” make-up, decrease the prominence\nwhich certain parts usually possess (Fig 2) When making-up for a\nbeldame, or some other character which should appear more than\nusually haggard, a striking effect is obtained by adding a spot of\neither dark-gray or brown, and blending it outwards Fig 3 —Before lining Fig 4 —After lining The lining of the eyes requires special attention, more particularly\nas their appearance depends so much upon the change of the eyelids\n(Figs 3 and 4); eyelashes too, when properly treated, make a vast\ndifference to the usual expression When it is necessary that the eyelashes should be more pronounced,\nblack grease paint is put on to the end of an artist’s stump, melted\nvery slowly by being held over a candle or other flame, and so\napplied Care should be taken, however, that no grease paint goes into\nthe eye, so when melting it must not be allowed to become too soft Black-lining grease paint is the best for eyelashes, and the amount\napplied depends entirely upon their natural thickness and darkness For darkening or lightening the eyebrows, grease paint “liners” are\nindispensable, and much preferable to India ink Sometimes it is\nnecessary to obliterate part of the eyebrow before the rest is “drawn-\nin,” in which case it is first of all coated with soap and then covered\nwith the same grease paint as used for the groundwork of “make-up ”\nThis done carefully, and toned to the same shade as the rest of face,\nleaves the actor free to “draw-in” any shaped eyebrow he desires For\na very thin eyebrow a toothpick can be utilized to advantage, a little\nmelted grease paint being rubbed upon it, and the line drawn with it\n(Figs 5 and 6) For Oriental effects the obliteration of the eyebrows is essential, and\nfresh ones with an upward tendency can be drawn-in at will, when\nonce the natural ones have been made to disappear More often than not it is necessary to increase the eyebrows,\nmaking them look thick and heavy, and if Nature has endowed the\nplayer with massive ones, it is an easy matter to comb them up the\nwrong way and apply a small quantity of grease-paint; but if they are\nnaturally thin the aid of false ones must be sought Crêpe hair, which\nis an indispensable accessory to the “make-up” art, can here be\nbrought into use, the ever-helpful “adhesia” being required as well Fig 5 —Eyebrow before lining Fig 6 —Eyebrow after lining The best plan is to model on a comb the eyebrow according to the\nshape desired; then, placing the latter in position, make it fast with\nthe use of the adhesia, taking care that the gum is only on the edges\nand not on the hair of the real eyebrow To obtain a sinister expression, eliminate the outer edges of the\neyebrows and paste a piece of crêpe hair over the eyebrows near the\nnose, the Mephistophelian effect being gained in the same way, except\nthat the outer corners should curl upwards (Figs 7 and 8) By fixing\non pieces of crêpe hair so that they meet over the nose, a stern and\neven fierce expression is produced Fig 7 —Natural eyebrow Fig 8 —Mephistophelian effect produced with crêpe hair “Juvenile” Make-up\nIn making-up for the character of a juvenile, the strength of light on\nthe platform or stage is to be taken into consideration If a fairly\nstrong light, the make-up must not be too deep, but the player will\nsoon become experienced in this matter by taking the trouble to\nconsider the effect of different lights Before commencing with the grease paints the face is well rubbed\nwith cold cream or cocoa butter, and wiped with a towel, so that none\nof the former remains visible",
    "Before commencing with the grease paints the face is well rubbed\nwith cold cream or cocoa butter, and wiped with a towel, so that none\nof the former remains visible Fig 9 —Preliminary lining The flesh-colored paint may now be drawn across the face several\ntimes, the method of procedure being: two lines across forehead, two\non each cheek, one down the nose, and several on the neck (Fig 9) With the palms of the hands this is smoothed over carefully, and\n\n\nfinally rubbed quite lightly with a dry towel The foundation is thus\nformed, and is really the most important part of the make-up, for if\nnot carefully done the rest will be unsatisfactory One of the chief\nfacts to be borne in mind is that very little paint should be used, so\nlittle as to be scarcely seen Rouge is next applied, red-lining paint or paste lip-rouge being used\nupon the cheek-bones, and carefully smoothed until it tones with the\nflesh on the cheeks After an application of powder, when the face\nfeels perfectly smooth, comes the task of lining-in, which has already\nbeen described Fig 10 —Natural lips Fig 11 —Lips accentuated by rouge The lip-rouge accentuates the lips (Figs 10 and 11), and should it\nbe necessary to make them of a more symmetrical appearance, this\nmay be accomplished by extending the rouge a trifle beyond the\nnatural outlines, though women need this little extra touch more often\nthan men When it is required to make the chin more prominent, a\ntouch of dry rouge beneath the lower lip will accomplish the effect,\nstill more being added to the cheeks if they are not quite colored\nenough (Fig",
    "When it is required to make the chin more prominent, a\ntouch of dry rouge beneath the lower lip will accomplish the effect,\nstill more being added to the cheeks if they are not quite colored\nenough (Fig 12) Fig 12 —“Juvenile” make-up For juvenile darky parts, burnt cork will do instead of the grease\npaints “Middle-Age” Make-up\nThis is perhaps the most difficult make-up, for it is much easier to\ngo to one extreme from another, than to make a fairly young person\nlook like a middle-aged one (Fig 13) In the case of a man it is advisable to depend on the addition of\nwhiskers and mustache, and even glasses or spectacles lend age A sallow paint is usually required for middle-age make-up, and it\ncan be blended with a lighter paint for pale effects; but to produce a\nhearty bloom or florid complexion, the application of a little red or\nbrown is recommended Fig 13 —“Middle-age” make-up Fig 14 —“Old-age” make-up The mid-gray wig is also an immense aid, but failing this, a small\namount of powder sifted over the hair will give a similar effect “Old-Age” Make-up\nIf the character desired to be represented is carefully studied, notice\nbeing taken of where there is a high light and where the shadows of\nthe face lie, there should be little or no difficulty in producing a\nlifelike representation Particular notice should be taken of wrinkles and lines, and these\nmust be carefully blended as in Fig Particular notice should be taken of wrinkles and lines, and these\nmust be carefully blended as in Fig 14",
    "14 The next essential is the wig, either gray or white being the most\nuseful For the old age complexion it is better to get the grease paint\nfor that purpose; but when the necessity for it is but seldom, an\napplication of the sallow paint, or in the case of great emaciation, the\naddition of a little blue, well blended, will create quite a good effect For the old age complexion it is better to get the grease paint\nfor that purpose; but when the necessity for it is but seldom, an\napplication of the sallow paint, or in the case of great emaciation, the\naddition of a little blue, well blended, will create quite a good effect Fig 15a —Natural features Fig 15b —Putty applications A Putty  addition to  forehead B „\n„\nnose C „\n„\nchin Fig 15c —Finished features Sometimes it is required that the nose shall be made larger; then the\n“nose putty” is called into play, carefully modeled on to the nose, and\nwith the aid of the same grease paint as is utilized for complexion,\nmade to correspond with the rest of the face (Figs Sometimes it is required that the nose shall be made larger; then the\n“nose putty” is called into play, carefully modeled on to the nose, and\nwith the aid of the same grease paint as is utilized for complexion,\nmade to correspond with the rest of the face (Figs 15a, 15b, and 15c) Fig 16 —Hand made-up for “old age ”\nDark shadows under the eyes can be produced by gray grease paint,\nbut for the formation of crow’s-feet, the brown will be found the best Fig 17",
    "17 —How to measure for a wig The hands must receive careful attention when the face and neck\nare finished, and “made-up” according to character If juvenile, they\nrequire coloring; if middle-age, a little of the sallow paint: the veins\naccentuated, and the flesh made to look pale for old age parts (Fig 16) When measuring for a wig, take the various lengths and widths as\nindicated by the numerals in Fig 17 17 Beards and Mustaches\nThe most inexpensive of these necessary adjuncts to the home\nentertainer’s make-up are undoubtedly those he models for himself\nfrom crêpe hair, which can be bought in a plait and untwined as it is\nwanted, a coarse-toothed comb being passed through it With a few\ntwirls it can be made the desired shape and cut, and when wanted for\na beard, opened out until it has a hollow cone-shape appearance, and\nplaced on the chin after a thin coating of adhesia has been applied The same method applies to eyebrow and mustache making When\nit is desired to create an unshaven, unkempt effect, pieces of crêpe\n\n\nhair are cut up exceedingly fine on to a newspaper, the chin covered\nwith adhesia and the finely-cut hair sifted evenly over the skin These\nlittle pieces are also useful for sprinkling where the false beard meets\nthe face, in order to take away the “abrupt” appearance that is often\nproduced The Removal of Make-up\nHaving told how to put on make-up, a few instructions for its easy\nremoval may not be out of place Whilst soap and water will take off\nthe grease paint, the simpler method is to remove it with one of the\nfollowing: Cold cream, cocoa butter, or olive oil Vaseline is to be\navoided, as it will often cause a growth of hair; and for this reason\nwhen purchasing cold cream it is advisable to procure the best, for in\nthe cheaper makes vaseline is largely employed Pieces of cloth kept\nspecially for the removal of “make-up” are to be recommended, one\nfor taking the chief layer off and another of soft texture for final\nrubbing before the much-needed wash is resorted to For dispelling traces of the prepared burnt cork used for minstrels\nand negro burlesques, a pure vegetable soap is all that is required CHAPTER III\nTHE QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST\nHow It’s Done\nThe machinations of the full-fledged quick-change artist afford the\nmind of his amazed spectator much speculation and curiosity as to\nhow his marvels of dexterity and transformation are achieved His\nvelocity would put summer lightning to the blush His mind and body\nare as pliable and elastic as his face; his very nature appears to\nundergo a swift metamorphosis of changes in the adoption of the\nvarious manners, idiosyncrasies, attitude, and gait of the character he\nportrays Although agile and unerring, he possesses something of the\nstoic calm of the hedgehog, and is as natural in his art as when\npartaking of a beefsteak in privacy He flashes before the vision on stage or drawing-room platform in\ndress so immaculate that it would seem to the uninitiated that his\ntoilet is the result of hours of care and deliberation In the costume of\nan old-world dandy he struts about, swaying his long-laced sleeves\nwith exquisite grace over his snuff-box, the while he patters his part A moment after, like a shooting star, he has swung himself through a\ndoor, reappearing almost instantaneously by means of another\nentrance, transformed in wig and attire to a totally different\nindividual in age and character Thus he continues playing his many parts so nimbly that one can\nscarcely believe he has not a bevy of actors hidden in the wings ready\nto fly through doors and windows as quickly as a cork pops from a\nbottle That his agility is grounded on a studied method, and his versatile\nacting the result of wheels within wheels, well-oiled, and precise as\nthe mechanism of a clock, is difficult to believe until his secrets of\nmanipulation are revealed “How is it done ” whispers the youth, palpitating with aspirations\nto do likewise Well, in only one way—that way simplicity itself,\nwhen once practice has made it perfect I am dealing now with the man who produces a play in which each\nrôle is played by himself, and will proceed to explain his proceedings\n\n\nfrom the start, so that the ambitious amateur may, at the next\nChristmas party or home gathering, try a humble imitation, and\ngradually achieve glory and greatness in the eyes of his family An Inexpensive “Stock in Trade”\nLet us study the tools and qualities essential to the quick-change\nartist His stock and properties are all inexpensive, save the wigs It is\nnot advisable to purchase cheap ones, as they soon show the signs of\nwear; while hair in good condition, and carefully kept, lasts for years His wardrobe contains garments of the cheapest material, and here\nthe old clothes-bag of the house, in which articles doomed for a\njumble sale are placed, is invaluable A clever needle and a little\ningenious manipulation result in splendid effects Fig 1 —Front view of “one-piece” garment; dotted lines denote springs Fig 1a —Back view of “one-piece” garment Every garment is made in one piece, and fastens at the back of the\nperformer by means of clock springs, which may be purchased from\nany clockmaker (Figs 1 and 1a)",
    "1 and 1a) The springs are pliable bands of\nsteel, cut and rounded, according to the size required, and punched\nwith small holes, by means of which they are fixed with stitches to\nneck, waist, legs and wrists These springs should be carefully\nconcealed in the hem, with sufficient material over to hide the\nopening at the back There is no time for fastening of buttons, tying of strings, adjusting\nof pins, or plastering of gum Even the mustaches used are fixed by\nmeans of small silver springs, which adhere to the interior of the\nnostrils as firmly as the springs of eyeglasses pinch the top of the nose\n(Fig Even the mustaches used are fixed by\nmeans of small silver springs, which adhere to the interior of the\nnostrils as firmly as the springs of eyeglasses pinch the top of the nose\n(Fig 2) Fig 2 2 —Back and front view of mustache fixed by spring The scenery required is also easily manufactured at home by the\namateur carpenter Thick brown paper, light wooden frames, or,\nbetter still, samples of wallpaper, fixed with small brass hinges, will\nserve excellently as an interior Thick brown paper, light wooden frames, or,\nbetter still, samples of wallpaper, fixed with small brass hinges, will\nserve excellently as an interior Until the student is far advanced in dexterity, it is wisest to limit his\nproduction to one environment The first thing, of course, is to choose a suitable piece If you are\nclever with your pen, you may compose a sketch to please yourself This is a good plan, for you will be governed in your production by\nwhat is most suitable and easy to your limitations If, however, no\nsuitable idea presents itself to you, go to any good dramatic firm, and\nspend a morning in looking through plays until you alight on\nsomething answering to your purpose In choosing a play, avoid an elaborate cast, complicated plot, or\nspeeches Long monologues are wearisome and monotonous; while, on\nthe other hand, conversations of too rapid a character will be\nimpossible \nto \nmanage \nsatisfactorily, \nhowever \nskillful \nyour\nmanipulation The novice should begin with a curtain raiser, containing two or\nthree persons, and the movement should be brisk and interesting Having fixed on his play, he studies his scenery He must have sufficient entrances and exits To use only one, so\nthat the audience always knows through which door he is about to\nappear, spoils the effect of his cunning It is far more dramatic to\nburst upon them from a direction least expected, and, to do this\nsuccessfully, as many doors or windows are necessary, as in a\nproduction played by several persons; but these should not be so\nplaced as to be aggressively prominent,—curtains, palms, screens, a\nsham cupboard or fireplace, by means of which sudden comings and\ngoings lend a thrilling reality to every movement Fig 3 depicts a\nsuggested plan The different costumes to be used should be numbered in the order\nrequired, and this is where a cool-headed and reliable dresser is\nabsolutely essential Fig 3 —Suggested plan of scenery arrangement for the quick-change artist To robe oneself by means of picking up garments and wigs from\n\n\nchair or different pegs is slow work, and leaves the stage empty for\ntoo long a time to keep the spectators interested in one’s movements The swiftest manipulation will be too slow to those awaiting the re-\nappearance, and, unless the movement is kept jogging, there will be\nno semblance of reality in the performance The Dresser\nThe dresser plays a part no less important than the artist Upon\nleaving the stage the latter immediately wrenches from his person the\ngarment in which he has just appeared The dresser is close to the exit\nwith costume No",
    "The dresser is close to the exit\nwith costume No 2 held out widely The performer walks straight\ninto the clothes, of which the clock springs are widely expanded In a\nflash they close round his person Another dresser adjusts wig, beard,\n&c , as he passes to his next entrance (Fig 4), with the result that he\nappears to answer the remark made by himself in the character No 1\nwithout any break being perceptible to the audience Whilst speaking\nthe words in the rôle of No 2, the dresser is awaiting him at the next\nexit with No 3 or No 1 clothes, (if No 1 and 2 are having a\nconversation), which he has swiftly picked up from the floor when\ndiscarded It is obvious that in order to be of real service the dresser must be\nas familiar with the words of the play as the performer It is not\nenough only to know the cues He must, by his knowledge, calculate\nto a hairbreadth how long No 2 takes to reply, and be prepared upon\nthe instant of exit with the apparel of No 1 Fig 4 —System of “changing” behind the scenes A plan of modes of entrances and exits should be arranged\nbeforehand between actor and dresser, and never altered Each sketch\nmust be founded on a different plan, and in each the movements\nshould be so carefully practiced that they become almost a habit Any\nchance alteration or mistake leads to bungling and loss of time, for, if\nNo 1 disappears through the exit fixed upon for No 2, naturally the\ndresser will not be there awaiting him, and this mischance will\nprobably throw all the succeeding movements into confusion The quick-change artist is employed in a race with time, and, time\n\n\nbeing swift and fleet of foot, the human competitor cannot possibly\nafford to loiter or blunder In a play or sketch in which several characters are to be\nimpersonated it does not make for speed to have installed as many\ndressers behind the scenes One, or at the most, two reliable and\nexperienced assistants are ample A larger number will only hinder\nthe artist’s and their own movements That there is a certain amount of nervous strain about this mode of\nperformance cannot be denied, but, by constant practice and coolness,\nthe artist greatly facilitates the mental effort that accompanies his\nportrayals A sketch should at most be of a half-hour’s duration The actor\nneeds some knowledge of acting, and must be able to change his voice\nto the different pitches required It should range from the high-\npitched falsetto of the aggressive female type of uncertain years to the\ngruff bass of the dogmatic father, while the cooing notes of the\nimmaculate heroine should be carefully cultivated Fig 5 —Showing wig, eyebrow, nose, and mustache combined Fig 6 —Another example, showing bonnet, wig, nose, spectacles, and veil\ncombined The artist must of necessity be clean-shaven, so that he can adapt\nbeard, “mutton chops,” or mustache as required Figs 5 \nand \n6 \nshow \ncompleted \nexamples \nof \none-piece\ntransformations Fig 7 depicts coat and breeches combined Most important of all the quick-change artist must be self-reliant,\nself-confident, and absolute master of emotions engendered by\nnervousness, for these lead to loss of memory where words and modes\nof entrance and exit are concerned While on the stage his mind must\nbe concentrated on the part he is playing to the exclusion of\neverything else, his attention as completely focused upon the\nimpersonation as though the other characters were being undertaken\nby different individuals For many of these practical suggestions the writer is indebted to a\nversatile quick-change artist, who willingly revealed some of the\n\n\nsecrets connected with his favorite form of entertainment He\nemphasized the fact that success is not achieved by means of\nnumerous wigs and costumes—a performer may possess the most\nelaborate wardrobe, repertoire, and paraphernalia, and yet sadly fail\nto move the interest and sympathy of his spectators As this artist remarked, the true art lies in facial expression, gesture,\nattitude, and change of voice These must be cultivated assiduously\nbefore any one-man play is produced, for it is only when the features\nare plastic as rubber, gesture and attitude the perfection of mimicry,\nthe voice containing every note in the range in which language is\nexpressed, that the steep ladder of success is scaled, and the timid\nnovice becomes transformed into the popular resourceful artist Fig 7 —Breeches and boots, showing front and back views; dotted lines\nindicate springs",

another\ndoes the same, and behold —a living Napoleon stands before us The\ngreater the artist, the simpler the preparations used, for the skilled\nrepresentative trusts to eyes, gesture, and figure rather than to the\nmaterial used Elasticity of feature is essential Without this it is impossible to\nproduce a living likeness One may possess wigs, beards, eyebrows,\nsham noses, and skulls of every imaginable shape and size, and yet\n\n\nfail through inability to assume the expression peculiar to the study\nundertaken In rehearsing impersonations a mirror is as good and true a friend\nas in reciting Observe how faithfully it reflects every change in the\nhuman countenance Supposing the character studied to be that of King Lear First read\nyour Shakespeare and memorize the lines which reach the very crisis\nof the agony and woe of love of that unfortunate monarch, as when,\nturning to his ungrateful, malignant daughters, Regan and Goneril, he\ncries—\n“I will do such things,—\nWhat they are yet I know not, but they shall be\nThe terrors of the earth You think I’ll weep;\nNo, I’ll not weep:\nI have full cause for weeping, but this heart\nShall break into a hundred thousand flaws\nOr ere I’ll weep O fool I shall go mad ”\nUnderstand the breaking, raging, heart-throbbing beneath them Repeat them aloud before the glass, with wild, burning eyes and\nquivering lips, with shaking hands upthrown and tensely up-drawn\nfigure, and by-and-by, if not at once, you will see King Lear peering at\nyou distraught When you have thoroughly gripped that image you may crown it\nwith snowy hair, pent brows, and ragged beard—but not till then And now, supposing, for a change—for there is nothing like variety\n—you undertake so utterly different a character as that of his faithful\nfool Here no jingling bells and jester’s folly are needed to aid you, for\nthese may be, and frequently are, but the danger signals to discerning\neyes of incompetent treatment; you want his shrewd, loyal heart in\nyour breast, his pulse beating in your brain, your finger-tips His\ncunning grin must be a wavering crack in a wizened face as you\nmemorize such caustic saws\nas—\n“Thou hast pared thy wit o’ both sides, and left nothing i’ the\nmiddle; here comes one o’ the parings ”\nThis method of memorizing and voicing some sentiment\ncharacteristic of the figure presented, is only for private use during\nrehearsals Costume performances are dumb, and, this being the case, it is easy\nto realize how eloquent and exact the physical contour must be for\nfaithful similitude Regard the idea as an object being photographed When you have\ngripped it, and, as it were, posed it before the camera of your brain,\nfocus, produce, and develop it on your features, which may well be\nlikened to a film Knowledge from Nature\nIn order to master the idiosyncrasies, mannerisms, eccentricities,\nand habits of characters, study is essential, and for this reason it is\nprobably best to acquire knowledge, not from imaginary heroes of\nfiction or drama, but from the fount of Nature Popular statesmen, musicians, admirals, soldiers, prelates, scientists,\nnovelists, and famous actors walk our streets to-day, and each\npossesses some anomaly of expression, feature, speech, gesture, or\nmannerism which is distinctly his own, and distinguishes him from his\nkind Just as no two leaves of a tree or petals of a flower are exact\nduplicates, so in mankind—no matter how subtle the anomaly—it\nexists, and must be fathomed and included in the portrait; delicately if\nit is delicate, proportionately broadly and ostentatiously as it is broad\nand ostentatious For example, there are some persons whose peculiarities are as\nevasive and subtle as the bouquet of a wine, the bloom of a grape We\nfeel their influence, we realize them to be the essence of their\nindividuality, and yet we fail to catch and master them; while there\nare other persons we meet whose eccentricities flare out at us in a\nmoment, and illuminate a character more fully and faithfully than any\nwords The pouting lip, the flickering eyelid, the shrug, the drumming on\nthe table with the fingers, the stroking of nose or chin, the revolving\nof thumbs, the pushing or patting of the hair, are eloquent signs that\nhe who runs may read, and make his own These may be called\nostentatious mannerisms The subtle peculiarities are far more difficult to catch and convey\nfaithfully One man suddenly narrows his eyes and looks\nintrospectively at you, or the mouth clinches unexpectedly over the\n\n\nteeth without any apparent reason A pulse suddenly quivers into\nsight at the temples, and is gone again The expression falls into\nrepose, but that very stillness indicates a perplexing and evasive\nexpression of temperament and individuality that you cannot catch to\nyour own satisfaction You may note coloring of hair, beard,\nmustache, &c You may purchase their exact match, and find the\nlikeness only a shell, because the essence that lends delicate fragrance\nand character has escaped you, and without it your representation,\nhowever flawless in coloring and texture, is as unsatisfactory and\nunreal as the marble statue to the human face and form Fundamental to the successful rendition of character impersonation\nis the cultivation of dexterity and quickness The dumb representative\nmust have all his regalia of wigs, beards, eyebrows, hats, helmets,\ncloaks, &c , well arranged, and within easy reach In a sense he is a conjuror—a magician His movements must be\nswift as lightning Indecision creates a jar; a pause or bungling spells\nfailure A small velvet-draped stand or table placed behind him, and\nwithin easy reach, with each article ready in the order wished, is\nessential In the center of this should be a mirror, with a good electric\nlight over it, but shaded as much as possible from the audience (Fig 1) Fig 1 —Character impersonator’s stage table The stand must be draped in dark colors, so as to obtrude as little as\npossible on the audience While in preparation, all other lights near\nyou should be turned off, and only switched on for a moment or two\nthe instant you are ready The attitude should be struck in the dark,\nand this must be sure and swiftly taken, and absolutely in keeping\nwith the character assumed",
    "The attitude should be struck in the dark,\nand this must be sure and swiftly taken, and absolutely in keeping\nwith the character assumed Avoid grease paints as far as possible A pianoforte or small orchestra playing some melody suitable to the\nimpersonation will prove a most valuable adjunct to the imagination\nof artist and audience Avoid such hackneyed characters as Napoleon, the late Sir Henry\nIrving, the German Emperor, and similar portrayals that may be\nwitnessed any evening at almost any vaudeville hall An audience is\nfrequently more amused by the imitation of types than of individuals Fig 2 —The costermonger Fig 3 —The lady-killing curate The fat saloonkeeper, the costermonger (Fig 2), the blasé gentleman\nof fashion, the racetrack bookmaker, the ruddy countryman, the lady-\nkilling curate (Fig 3), and the typical Soap King (Fig 4), the country\nrustic (Fig 5), and many other such types are excellent studies for\nrepresentation Fig 4 —The soap king Fig 5 —The country bumpkin —The country bumpkin Although the character portrayals of the costumed and wigged\nimpersonator depend on wordless demonstrations between the items\n\n\nand in ordinary evening dress, the artist may announce the name of\nthe personality to be represented, or have it worked in almanac\nfashion and shown to the audience as it appears The former method, however, is quite usual, and perhaps more\nsuitable to drawing-room entertainments It may be kept in mind that this style of performance should not be\nunduly long, and should never exceed twelve or fifteen minutes Speaking Impersonations\nSpeaking impersonations are more difficult to achieve successfully,\nfor in them, as a rule, the artist has no regalia to depend upon His\nhair, his face, his voice, his limbs, his fingers are his only aids, but\nthese are more than sufficient for the talented and skilled performer His voice is as elastic as his features in power of mimicry He should be clean-shaven, but with a plentiful crop of hair, which\nhe can arrange and manipulate as he wishes with a mere twirl or pat\nof the hand, and these must be sympathetic and convincing\nexpressions of his every movement “There is no more expression in\nthe back of the hand than in the back of the head,” yet of what subtle\ndemonstrations is it not capable A whole epitome of human emotions may be demonstrated by the\ngradual unfolding of the flexible, sensitive fingers The first finger\nraised, and intelligence and meaning begin to develop The palms\nupturned, the shoulders uplifted, and the head slightly bent, and you\nsee the suave helplessness typical of the Frenchman The arms flung outward, with the palms parallel, and the fingers\nfalling naturally, indicate sentiments of affection, welcome, and\ncordial invitation Stretched farther away, with fingers distended, and\nyou have entreaty, desire, passionate pleading, and supplication The\nwrists upturned, the fingers crooked, and grasping, and we see the\npersonification of rage and avarice, while the raising of the open\nhand, what horror it indicates Yet the hand is only a part of the mechanism Its soul is in the eye,\nwhich combines in partnership and signifies calm, candor, liberality,\nlove, gentleness, meditation, resentment, boldness, defiance, wrath,\nand fear, in complete accord with its dumb component The nostrils inflate in scorn, the head is proudly raised in dignity or\n\n\njoy, and meekly bowed in humility; bent forward in shame, squarely\nupright, with firm compressed features, for determination and will\npower The artist must never be tempted to sacrifice his cultured discretion\nin a portrayal For instance, to give the cockney the musician’s hand,\nor the priest the bookmaker’s wink, the sly housebreaker anxious to\nescape notice the loud, boisterous guffaw of the countryman, is to be\nguilty of the most insensate blunders Action and gesture should be skilled and practiced handmaidens to\nthe brain that molds the idea, and their service must be winged to\nrespond “True ease in action comes from art, not chance,\nAs they move easiest who have learnt to dance ”\nTemperament\nThe psychological treatment of characters depends and is influenced\nin no slight degree by temperament The character the student is\nabout to study has its peculiar atmosphere of mind and body, which\nunconsciously dictates and regulates its actions from head to foot The\nmost important temperaments\nare:—\n1 The optimistic temperament, embracing impulsive, warm-hearted,\nsanguine, easily-pleased, tender, ambitious dispositions 2 The pessimistic temperament, embracing nervous, timid, sensitive,\noverwrought, peevish, unstable, irritable, depressed, neurotic, restless,\ndissatisfied, cynical, morbid, self-conscious dispositions 3 The artistic temperament, embracing extravagant, sympathetic,\nimaginative, languid, reckless, turbulent, excitable, hot-tempered,\nbrooding dispositions 4 The commercial temperament, which embraces the phlegmatic,\nlymphatic, enigmatic dispositions Now, the first way of approaching a new study is to consider what\ncharacteristics it possesses, and to what class of temperament it\nbelongs, and, when this is decided, the student asks himself, what\ngesture will be the most symbolic and eloquent of that temperament This method, conscientiously adhered to, will provide a safe and\nfirm groundwork for the beginner With judgment and sense, he will soon be able to place his\n\n\ncharacter in its right niche, and to plan his actions in accordance,\neven if he has never seriously studied gesture The movements of an\nopen-hearted, liberal man are usually large, free, and liberal He\nopens his arms widely for an embrace He gives you his hand in\ngreeting warmly, and with frank, cordial pressure His eyes shine clear\nand steady below a benevolent forehead His walk, with its free,\nsteady swing, is the index of his generous and kindly disposition Now contrast him with the mean man, the usual type of which is\npinched in physical delineation, action, expression, and thought His\nhair grows sparsely on a skull, screwed as grimly to his face as the\nupper section of a bicycle bell to the lower His eye is squeezed in a\nnarrow slit of socket, roves backwards and forwards like a marble in a\npuzzle-box His mouth is withered in bitter antagonism for his fellow-\nmen To catch a generous smile upon his colorless lips is to surprise a\nsunbeam at midnight Of course, there are many shades in the scale between these\nextremes of the very liberal man and the very mean one, and the artist\nwho is imitating the thrifty soul must remember the infinitesimal\npoints of difference which distinguish him alike from the benevolent\nand avaricious And, in the wide margin of temperaments, an artist must be careful\nnot to label and pigeon-hole his characters as if they were bottles of\nphysic, for in the complex nature of one man there may be vast\ncontradictions, just as in many good medicines there is a minute\nquantity of poison, so a disposition may be tinted with qualities not at\nall worthy of admiration There are occasions when the most impulsive becomes cold and\nhesitating, the most affectionate cruel, the most benevolent\ncalculating, and the most patient, hot-tempered and passionate Character and Circumstance\nThe artist must never forget the important crucible of circumstances\nwhich molds and forms each character, and sometimes is potent to\nchange the most optimistic temperament to one of pessimism and\ncynical bitterness Yet, while remembering this, one must probe\nbeneath the stamped envelope of environment to decipher the\nhieroglyphics of the fettered soul inclosed One does not find the wild, untutored gestures of the stump orator\n\n\nin the refined politician, nor the turbulent raving of the fanatic in the\nsermon of the cultured ecclesiastic, while the expression natural to the\nplebeian is such as the aristocrat never indulges There are many natures so complex as to defy all classification, and\nto portray them successfully is an almost impossible matter unless one\nmasters the delicate mechanism of their nature A grandfather’s clock\nto outward appearance is a figured circle in a narrow wooden case,\nwith softly regularly-moving pendulum, but get behind that exterior\nto the revolving wheels, and see what an amount of intricacies are\ninvolved So the man who presents a calm, self-possessed exterior to\nthe world, may in reality seethe with qualities not at all phlegmatic or\nlevel-headed In conquering the technicalities of character, one must, as far as\npossible, grip the crisis the personality has reached in his lifetime, and\nthis is one reason why a historic character is easier to grasp than one\ncontemporaneous For example, he who portrays Napoleon in the\nflush of success and victory, does not represent him as he who images\nhim at the end of his career—broken-hearted, alone, and in despair,\nsuffering the calumny and scorn of those who exhibited most faith\nand admiration of his sanguinary achievements Correct attitude and pose are extremely important, and should be\ncarefully studied The old man has tottering bowed knees, but the\nyouth stands firmly The reverberation of the interior gestures rules and gives to the\ntorso or trunk the inspiring grace of truth and beauty It is only when\na soldier or sailor on duty is being represented that the artist may\nstand bolt upright and move automatically At all other times the\ntorso should be held with flexible ease, ready to combine with eye,\nface and gesture, in the emotion and force of the impersonation To\nportray the child with mature and abandoned gesture is to present a\ncaricature of nature, and, in like manner, to represent the adult with\nthe careless gestures of the child, is to convey the impression of one\ninane and undeveloped In attitude, remember the maxim of Cresollius: “Without the hand,\nno eloquence ”\nTo imagine a boy stealing jam with the wild eye and hand-clawing\nattitude of the miser snatching at gold is to exaggerate grossly and\nconfuse the human emotions, and to paint comedy as the burlesque of\ntragedy The hands are capable of such a vast amount of expression\nthat they have been considered “numerous and copious as words\n\n\nthemselves ”\nWhile imitating characters, never be bound by the representations\nof other artists you have seen See with your own eyes, study with\nyour own brain, avoid that conventionality of fashion and ideas that\ncripples progress Let your maxims be your own, and, when they are\nmastered, be not ashamed to demonstrate them with grand and self-\nreliant originality CHAPTER V\nTHE UNIVERSAL HAT\nMarvels of Chapeaugraphy\nEvery entertainer must have felt at some time or other the need of\na short “gag” to fill up that awkward gap which so frequently occurs\nbetween the conclusion of one long piece and the commencement of\nanother The mind of an audience is of a flighty nature and requires to be\nkept continually amused, or it will wander into paths of boredom; and\nmany a good entertainment has failed for the simple reason that the\nball has not been kept rolling It is during one of these uncomfortable pauses that the Universal\nHat may be appropriately introduced, and, if worked well, it cannot\nfail to gain approval You can either buy or make a Universal Hat, and as to do the\nformer will cost a dollar or more, whilst the latter can be done for less\nthan half that sum, it is well to be your own hat-maker Obtain a piece of fairly strong black felt, measuring 24 inches\nsquare, and cut it into a ring, the diameter of the whole circle being\n24 inches, with a hole in the center 7 inches across That is all that is\nrequired as far as the hat is concerned, and the success of your piece\nwill now rest entirely with yourself Arrange a screen behind which to retire, and have a good-sized\nmirror, so placed that you will be able to see in a moment how your\nhead-dress suits Keep a little rouge ready, as well as a burnt cork for\nblacking eyebrows, making mustaches, &c Remember that quickness\nis a necessity, for the smarter you are in changing your hats the more\nthe audience will appreciate the effect Now to give a few examples of what can be done with the universal\nhat, so arranged as to give scope for any amount of ingenuity in\ninventing new ideas Before beginning your show step from behind the screen, raise the\nring of felt in your hand, and exhibit it to the audience Then step\nback under cover, put the hat on your head, giving it a tilt in front\nand a rakish tip to one side, assume a stern expression, and, if you\n\n\nhave a dog-whip amongst the stage properties, grasp it firmly in your\nhand, and make an appearance before the spectators in the character\nof Buffalo Bill Take care always to face the audience as in Fig 1,\notherwise the top of your head will be seen through the hole in the\nhat Fig 1 —Buffalo Bill Remember that in this, as in all the other characters, a lot—indeed,\nalmost everything—depends upon your expression, which should be\nentirely in keeping with the person you represent Buffalo Bill must\nnot wear a grin, but must appear as grimly in earnest as though he\nwere hastening to the relief of the Deadwood stage Another point to bear in mind, is that you must not make a long\nappearance A minute for each character is ample, and, as you appear\nbefore your audience, announce who you are in a tone suggestive of\nthe person you are representing A few remarks in keeping with the\ncharacter will greatly add to the realism of your make-up, but let your\nwords be like your appearances—brief and effective Popular Characters\nNapoleon makes a good character to represent, and his hat is very\neasily made Draw two sides of the felt through the hole in the center,\nand pull the hat firmly down about your ears, as in Fig",
    "Draw two sides of the felt through the hole in the center,\nand pull the hat firmly down about your ears, as in Fig 2 Assume a\nstern expression, suggestive of Waterloo, thrust your left hand into\nyour breast, hump your shoulders, and look fiercely at the audience as\nthough you could see Wellington at the farther end of the room Later on in the performance you can represent Bonaparte’s great\nantagonist by making the hat in the same way, but wearing it with the\npeak forward as in Fig Later on in the performance you can represent Bonaparte’s great\nantagonist by making the hat in the same way, but wearing it with the\npeak forward as in Fig 3 Fig 2 —A hat suggesting Napoleon Fig 3 —The Iron Duke General Wolfe is another easy character to assume His hat is made\nin this way Lay the felt ring flat on the table, lift up one side, draw it\ntowards you and then pass it downwards through the hole Pull back\nthe piece that you have passed through the hole, in the direction from\nwhich you took it in the first place, and you will find it has made a\nhat of the shape shown in Fig Pull back\nthe piece that you have passed through the hole, in the direction from\nwhich you took it in the first place, and you will find it has made a\nhat of the shape shown in Fig 4 4 When you fit it on your head pull it\nfirmly down towards your ears, but not too tightly, and the effect will\nbe complete A little practice will serve to perfect you in making the\ntwists necessary for this and other hats, and patience will soon reward\nyou To heighten the resemblance to General Wolfe, whiten your\ncheeks with a little chalk and draw them slightly in, to give the\nappearance of being haggard and wan If you can get a sword, point\nto the ceiling with it enthusiastically, as one can imagine the General\ndid when he encouraged his men to climb the Heights of Abraham As a contrast to these more exalted personages, you can now appear\nas the coal driver; although if you wish to increase the realism by\nsmearing your face into a state of suitable dirtiness with burnt cork, it\nwould be advisable to leave this character to the last To make the\nhat, lay your felt flat as before and draw up a piece from the rim as\nwas done in the case of General Wolfe Now, instead of passing it\ncompletely through the hole, push it only halfway through, giving it\nwhat may be called a half twist It will then appear as in Fig 5, ready\nfor wear Draw it tightly over your head, and slouch upon the scene,\nputting your hand to your mouth and shrieking “Coal O ” in a cracked\nvoice Fig 4 —General Wolfe Fig 5 —The Coal Driver Fig 6 —A Priest’s Biretta Fig 6a —A Priest You may now appear as a priest in a biretta Place the felt upon the\ntable and then draw a side from below, up through the hole, exactly\nthe reverse way from that in which Wolfe’s hat was made When you\nhave drawn it right through, bend it down and pass it up through the\nhole once more, thus making two twists It then resembles Fig 6, and\nif you draw it upon your head with the broad brim flush against the\nforehead, the impersonation will be striking Tuck a little lapel of\nwhite into the collar, raise your right hand with two fingers extended,\nand face the company with as pious an expression as you can assume Fig 7 —The Pied Piper As a last example, an effective appearance may be made as the\nfamous Pied Piper of Hamelin Having laid the felt flat, make a twist\nfrom below upwards, as you did in the former hat—the priest’s\nbiretta But for this hat only one twist is required, so when you have\ndone this, the hat will appear as in Fig 7",
    "7 You must now put your\nhands in the opening and stretch it as wide as possible, thus making\nthe rolls very taut and firm Turn the felt over and fit it on the head as\nshown in the picture Draw your collar up, take a tin whistle in your\nhand, and pipe a few notes before making your appearance Then\nslink into view with a cunning smile upon your lips, reciting these\nlines from the\npoem:—\n“Please your honors, I am able\nBy means of a secret charm to draw\nAll creatures living beneath the sun,\nThat creep or swim, or fly or run,\nAfter me so as you never saw And I chiefly use my charm\nOn creatures that do people harm,\nThe mole, the toad and newt and viper;\nAnd people call me the Pied Piper ”\nOf course these are but hints An ingenious person will soon\ndiscover endless other ways of adapting the Universal Hat in such a\nmanner as to keep the audience amused for some considerable time Always remember, however, these two\n\n\naxioms—\nLet your make-up be done quickly Let your appearances be short CHAPTER VI\nNIGGER MINSTRELSY\nThe Comical End-men\nSome people imagine that a black face, a pair of large check\ntrousers and a rather dilapidated hat, are all that’s necessary to make\na nigger minstrel This is, however, a great mistake, and whosoever\nfeels the stirring of an ambition to amuse his friends with a nigger\nentertainment, must not be discouraged if he finds the road harder\nthan \nhe \nexpected Its \ndifficulties, \nhowever, \nare \nfar \nfrom\ninsurmountable Fig 1 —Seating arrangements of nigger minstrel troupe For a really successful nigger entertainment seven persons are\nnecessary; the interlocutor—usually known as Mr Johnson—one bass\nand one tenor singer and four “end-men ” The troupe should be\narranged as shown in Fig 1",
    "1 Now, before describing what to do, a few\nwords as to how you should arrange yourselves will not be out of\nplace The stage should be raised, if possible, to enable any member of\nthe audience to see the performers Unless you are performing a farce\nor drama, such as will be described later, a curtain is not absolutely\nnecessary, provided the troupe can get to the stage without having to\npass right through the assembled company Minstrels’ “Make-up”\nAs far as “make-up” is concerned, this should present no difficulty\nwhatever Many barbers, and some music shops, can supply “nigger\nblack,” which must be rubbed into the face and hands, after the skin\nhas been well washed and dried When the performance is over the\nblack can easily be removed by means of soap and hot water To\nredden the lips and enlarge the mouth, use carmine or rouge; cover\nthe lips and paint them to appear as though stretching almost from\n\n\near to ear (Fig 2) Cheap wigs can be obtained for but a small sum\nfrom any hairdresser Those of Mr Johnson and the sentimentalists\nshould be as shown in Fig 3, while each of the “end-men” should\nprovide himself with one similar to that depicted in Fig 4 4 The\n“interlocutor” and sentimentalists usually wear ordinary evening\ndress, the “end-men,” however, wearing frilled collars, cuffs and\nfronts, as shown in Fig The\n“interlocutor” and sentimentalists usually wear ordinary evening\ndress, the “end-men,” however, wearing frilled collars, cuffs and\nfronts, as shown in Fig 5 A complete outfit comprising stockinette\nface, head, eyes, teeth, and hat can be purchased for about $2 50 Fig 2 —Showing how the lips are painted Fig 3 —Interlocutor and sentimentalist’s wig Fig 4 —End-man’s wig, showing workable tuft Music is a necessity with a troupe, and you will accordingly require\nanother person to play the piano as an accompaniment to the songs\nand choruses, as well as for the overture and instrumental pieces It is\nalso presumed that the members of the troupe have fairly good voices\nand are able to sing, not only in tune but in time with one another In serious or sentimental songs, such as “Swanee River” and other\nfavorites, the “end-men” must forego their love of mirth and take part\nin all solemnity, reserving their facetious behavior for a more timely\nmoment After these remarks the principal characters in the troupe\nmay be discussed Fig 5 —Frilled collar, shirt front, and cuffs used by end-man The interlocutor is one of the most important persons upon the\nstage It is his duty to introduce each number of the programme to the\naudience; to be the butt of the “end-men’s” jokes; and to assume upon\nevery occasion an air of the utmost ignorance and simplicity, that\nshall prove an admirable foil to the exuberant humor of his\n\n\ncompanions He must appear absolutely innocent of any idea of the\nanswers to the riddles and conundrums asked, and must reply to the\noccasionally personal remarks of his friends with the utmost suavity\nand good humor In short, what with helping the others to sing and\nkeeping the ball rolling generally, Mr Johnson is responsible, to a\nlarge extent, for the success or failure of the entertainment From Failure to Success\nThe “end-men,” with whom lies the task of producing most of the\nfun of the nigger entertainment, must be possessed of a ready wit—\nable to tide over awkward pauses, prepared with some “gag” when\nthe fun is beginning to flag, and capable of turning disaster into a\nmighty success From Mr Johnson’s placid obtuseness they will be\nable to draw much sport, and bandying jokes at each other’s and the\ninterlocutor’s expense, should keep the audience shaking with\nlaughter Whilst on the subject of jokes a note of warning may be struck The\nmoment humor changes to vulgarity, it produces disgust in any\nrespectable audience It is therefore well worth while to think over the\nregular jokes you intend introducing into the performance, and if\nthere be any that are in the remotest way likely to offend the feelings\nof any person in the company, cut them out There is another point worth remembering in the matter of jokes It\nmay seem a truism to remark that a joke should be funny, yet the very\nfunniest of jokes will fall flat if it is not led up to suitably Don’t ask\nMr Johnson a conundrum in a meek tone as though you were\nrequesting him to tell you the time His immovably suave ignorance\nwill extract the answer from you, it is true, but the chances are ten to\none that the audience have either missed the question or will fail to\nsee the point of the answer Jokes should be introduced by a certain amount of patter which\nserves to engage the attention of the hearers in such a way that when\nthe inevitable fun really comes they are perfectly prepared to\nappreciate it Books can be bought containing numbers of these jokes\nwith the suitable patter, and these will prove very useful to the\namateur, who must nevertheless remember that success really\ndepends upon the way in which he springs the joke upon the\naudience Coon Songs\nAnd now a word about the singing It goes without saying that the\nlarger the troupe and the better trained the voices, so much the more\nenjoyable will be the choruses The number of songs from which to\nselect is legion; the best plan is to write to some leading musical\npublisher, telling him what you want He will be only too pleased to\nsend his catalogue with some advice as to what will prove suitable Avoid any comic songs with a double or doubtful meaning, and keep\nto strictly characteristic songs as far as possible Old favorites never\nfail to win applause, and are always safe to fall back upon; but do not\nbe too conservative—try some novelties Songs and “Gags”\nNigger entertainments are usually divided into two parts, the first\nconsisting of songs and “gags,” as the short dialogues and impromptu\njokes are called, whilst the second is devoted to stump speeches and\none-act dramas or farces So far as stump speeches are concerned,\nexcellent collections are published by the leading publishers of that\nclass of entertainment Your bookseller will obtain a catalogue for\nyou, and a choice can then be made The speeches should be very\ncarefully learnt by heart, together with the appropriate gestures (for\nwhich full instructions are always given), and unceasingly practiced\nuntil you are able to make your stump oratory bring down the house\nwith delight Stump speeches are the province of the “end-men,” and\nproperly delivered, can be relied upon to prove one of the successes of\nthe evening One-Act Dramas\nWith regard to one-act dramas and farces, a very exhaustive\ncatalogue can be furnished by publishers, with full instructions as to\nhow they should be performed A word of advice, however, to the\nintending actors Too much care cannot be expended upon\npreparation and rehearsals Nothing will go of itself in this world, and\nleast of all plays and sketches; it is a fatal mistake to imagine that the\nsmallest drama or even “gag” will succeed by its own merits and with\n\n\nonly a little help from yourself Endless trouble and care must be\ntaken in preparing the simplest joke, and boisterous as the fun may\nprove upon the stage, it cannot be spontaneous, but must be diligently\nrehearsed again and again before it can be presented to your\naudience Your great object is, not to enjoy the fun yourself but to make the\nothers enjoy it, and if this is borne in mind, you will not only amuse\nthem but have a delightful time yourself Again, never forget that in a\nplay one actor relies upon another to repeat the actual words of the\n“book,” as cues and stage directions depend upon verbal accuracy Do\nnot, therefore, introduce any novelties of your own—learn the words\nand keep to them, for any original introductions on your part may\nthrow the whole play into disorder, exasperate the other actors and\ndisgust the audience To keep to the “book” is easy enough, and if you act in earnest—\nand this is essential for the most comic pieces—you will find no\ndifficulty in sustaining your part correctly and intelligently Do not\nlaugh at your own jokes, unless you are instructed to do so, but keep a\ngrave face and appear as though to find yourself in the most farcical\nsituations were a matter of everyday life To give an idea of a reasonably simple programme which shall\ninclude a farce, the following is\nsuggested:—\nPART I\nOverture on the piano A march Chorus Some song in which all voices can join Solo Preferably a sentimental song Jokes Properly led up to by an end-man Comic Song Also by an end-man Solo Another sentimental song",
    "Another sentimental song And so on for ten or eleven turns,\nafter which comes the\nInterval During this the pianist can entertain the audience with\nsome operatic piece PART II\nChorus As above Piano Solo Whilst this is being played the stage should be prepared\n\n\nfor the\nStump Speech Curtain and Piano Solo During which the stage is arranged for the\nFarce During which the stage is arranged for the\nFarce Solo Sentimental song Finale This programme must, of course, be adapted to any exigencies of\ntime, space or other circumstances, but will serve as an example of\nwhat can be done To conclude with a few hints as to the actual entertainment If\npossible, have a sufficient number of programmes printed, or carefully\nand legibly written by hand, as the most tolerant audience grows\nrestive if it does not know “what comes next ” Distribute these, and\nlet one of your party make it his business to see that the company are\nproperly and comfortably seated Begin punctually; if your audience\nhave to wait they become impatient, and as there are few people more\nincapable of seeing a joke than impatient folk, it will be to your own\nadvantage to begin at the proper time Be as silent as possible behind\nthe scenes; it is very tantalizing for the spectators to hear a wild\nrushing hither and thither, hoarse whispering, and the various signs of\nexcitement in which they are not allowed to participate Of course a certain amount of bustle is unavoidable, but reduce it to\na silent minimum Do not be shy; remember in the first place that the\nblack hides all your blushes, and in the second place that nobody is\nthere to see you, but to see a “nigger” who is going to make them\nlaugh Half of your audience have probably done the same in their\ntime, whilst the other half would have done so if they could; so take\nheart, and show them all how really well it can be done However\nwell-disposed your company may be, do not let that be any excuse for\nslovenliness on your part, but let it rather incite you to work all the\nharder, so that when everything is finished and the black is off your\nfaces, the universal opinion will be—“We would never have imagined\nthat it could be carried out so well ”\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\nSOME SUGGESTIONS IN BLACK\nFor “Nigger Minstrels”\nIn the previous chapter hints have been given to enable a party of\nfive or more performers to give a Nigger Minstrel Entertainment The\nobject of the following is to show how one or two people can contrive\nto amuse their friends with a few negro performances The pieces are suitable either as items in a variety entertainment, or\nas convenient “gags” to be introduced between longer entertainments\nwhen the interest of the audience is to be sustained by some timely\ndiversion It might be remarked, by the way, that it is surprising how much\nthe effect of a joke depends upon the humor of the audience If they\nare feeling in a happy and pleasant frame of mind, the mere sight of a\ncomic man is sufficient to bring forth roars and shrieks of laughter But if a gloom or lack of interest has settled over the company, even\nthe comic genius of the late Dan Leno would most probably have\nfailed to raise a smile There are two things almost invariably associated with nigger songs\n—a banjo and bones Proficiency with both these is necessary before\nattempting to give an entertainment Practice and a quick ear are indispensable for playing or even\nstrumming a banjo A very little practice will enable you to strike\nchords with ease, whilst a quick ear will show when they should be\nplayed To make a successful “hit” with the “bones” is a question, more or\nless, of knack A set of four bones costs about $1 00 When buying take care they\nare sound, i e with no crack or flaw, and that they contain no core of\npith, as this is liable to dull the sound, rendering it quite impossible to\nobtain the sharp clean click so necessary for successful rendition Having obtained your bones—a pair for each hand—you must know\nhow they should be held Notice they are slightly curved, as in Fig 1 With a pair in each hand place the ends between the first and second\nand second and third fingers, the convex sides towards each other\n\n\n(Fig 2) Hold No 1 (the bone between the first and second fingers)\nfairly firmly, although not so stiffly as to rob it of a distinct spring",
    "1 (the bone between the first and second fingers)\nfairly firmly, although not so stiffly as to rob it of a distinct spring No 2 (the bone between the second and third fingers) must be rapped\nup against its companion by the action of the third and fourth fingers Fig 1 —Curved bone used in nigger minstrelsy A sharp shake of the hand will make the bones clap together, while\nif you keep the hand quivering and also work bone No 2 vigorously a\ncontinuous rattle is produced Fig 2 —How to hold the bones Fig 3 —Correct position for playing the bones A good plan, when once you are accustomed to having the bones\nbetween the fingers, is to hold the hand with the knuckles upwards,\nthe bones pointing to the ground, as in Fig 3 By this means the\nfingers are allowed freer play At the same time a better appearance is\ngiven to the exhibition At first you will find your rattles jerky and spasmodic, but do not be\ncontent until you have the bones so entirely under command that you\ncan make a long rattle as easily as a solitary tap, remembering that\nthe less exertion you betray the better will be the effect Your own ear will show you how to introduce them into the music Do not drown the air—the bones are only intended to give a point, to\naccentuate certain parts and not to render them inaudible A smart\nrattle may be given at the commencement of the music and at the\nconclusion of the song Introducing Jokes\nAll jokes should be introduced by a certain amount of\nconversational patter between the Interlocutor and “Bones ”\nMr Johnson, the interlocutor, is always a very simple-minded\n\n\nperson, unable to see any joke until it has been fairly thrown at him,\nand perfectly innocent in the presence of the most obnoxious puns He\nhas a certain patronizing air with his companion which only serves to\nmake his innate simplicity more delightful Mr Johnson maintains an\nimpassive face in the most ludicrous and trying situations by his very\nmatter-of-fact behavior, extracting all kinds of smart things from the\nfunny man “Bones” is the very reverse of Mr Johnson He is up to all the latest\ncatches, full of quips and puns, is possessed of a never-failing store of\nquaint experiences and remarkable stories, the most improbable of\nwhich are gravely swallowed by Johnson Yet the big red lips on his\nbroad black face must be immovable and never show the least\nsymptom of a smile as he recounts with stolid solemnity his\nmarvelous doings to his credulous friend The following dialogue is arranged for these two characters Mr Johnson asks Bones all kinds of simple and apparently harmless\nquestions; but Mr Bones replies with a constant succession of puns\nand\njokes:—\nJohnson So you’ve been enjoying yourself, William, lately, I\nunderstand Dining out a good deal Bones Oh yes, that’s right I’d dine with anybody Johnson Yes, but I’m told you dined with the Mayor last week Is\nthat right Bones Oh yes, that’s right Johnson",
    "Johnson Then I suppose you had an excellent dinner—plenty to eat\nand drink What was the menu Bones Well, to tell you the truth, there was a lot of ’em there, but I\ndon’t recollect him Johnson Ah, you don’t understand me I mean what was the bill of\nfare Bones Bones Oh, well, it was a pretty fair bill I believe it cost him about\n$300 Johnson No, you don’t understand me I mean what dishes did you\nhave to eat Bones Well, we didn’t eat any dishes Well, we didn’t eat any dishes Johnson Johnson No, no, of course not; but what did you have to eat and\ndrink Bones Well, I believe the first thing we had to eat was something to\ndrink Johnson And what did you have to drink, then Bones Well, it was a new soup Johnson A new soup Well, I should like to know what that was What was it called Bones Oh, I don’t remember exactly what it was, but you might\nmention the names of a few to help me Johnson Johnson Well, was it Mullagatawny Bones No, it wasn’t Multigatony Johnson Was it Mock Turtle Bones No, it wasn’t him Johnson Was it gravy Bones No Johnson Was it spring Bones Bones No, it wasn’t spring, it was summer Johnson Well, I must give it up, William What was it Bones Oh, I know, it was what they call—er—er—shadow soup Johnson Oh, then, it must be a new soup I’ve never heard of\nshadow soup Bones Never heard of shadow soup Johnson No, I haven’t I should like to taste that How is it made Bones I’ll tell you You go down to the market, buy a nice chicken,\ntake it home, stretch a line across the yard, hang the chicken in the\nmiddle of the line, put a nice clean pail of water under the chicken,\nand when the sun comes out it casts its beautiful rays on the chicken,\nreflects the shadow in the pail of water, and that’s what they call\nshadow soup Johnson Oh, you go down to the market, buy a nice chicken, take it\nhome, stretch a line across the yard, hang the chicken in the middle of\nthe line, put a nice clean pail of water under the chicken, and when\nthe sun comes out it casts its beautiful rays on the chicken and reflects\nthe shadow in the water, and that’s what they call shadow soup Bones Yes Johnson But, my dear sir, you’ve forgotten one of the principal\nthings Bones Oh, have I What’s that Johnson What’s that Why, supposing you have no sun Bones Well, then—you have no soup Stump Speeches\nA little extra effort in the matter of make-up might be attempted for\nstump speeches, for the orator should be as “seedy” as possible in the\nway of costume A tattered coat and battered hat are usually\nconsidered essential to the character, whilst an old dilapidated\numbrella, of bulky form and shapeless proportions, is useful for\nbrandishing at the emotional parts or thumping as the impressive\npoints in the speech are reached The stump orator should deliver his speech mounted upon a rickety\nchair or table, for his exaggerated endeavors to maintain his balance\nwill be certain to cause fun amongst the audience Having taken his position with much danger, and with a familiar\nlook at the spectators, the speaker may embark upon the lecture He\nshould speak distinctly and slowly, pausing every now and again to\nillustrate his remarks with some quip or to steady himself upon the\nvery rocky pulpit As an example he may take the following, which will serve for the\nopening sentences of a stump speech on\n“Sound”:—\nLadies and Gentlemen, and others I have much, I have much (puts\nhand in pocket as if to feel how much money he has), I say I have\nmuch—much feeling of proudness in assembling here in large\nnumbers before you—me—you here dis even The subject of my\ninvestigation has been for many long years, that is to say early years,\nshort years, new years, old years, pig’s and donkey’s ears, and the rest\nof the human race I say the subject of my intellectual and not at all\nless \npig’s-head-a-frying \nlecture \non \nthe \nvarious \nmeans \nof\ncommunicating our thoughts, words, title-deeds, and other chattels,\nsuch as sauce-pans, frying-pans, umbrellas, knobbed sticks, brick-bats\nand bricks without bats, I say the subject of this important question,\nwhether it be the pop-shopular question or whether it be unwise to\nmention, or otherwise in dimension, let it be understood that previous\nto preparing myself to begin—to commence, I must ask a few\nquestions about the temperaments, detriments out-o-debtriments,\ncape-abilities, cloak-abilities, hats, caps, boots, shoes, underlinen,\nsocks, and other kind of earthenware I say before I, as I said before I\nsaid “I say before”—this subject can be clothes-properly dissolved, we\n\n\nwill, although I say it myself, ladies and gentlemen, I say we shall,\nladies, we shall all be dead men (Takes pinch of snuff, wipes nose\nwith wet part of handkerchief, wiping off some black Resumes\ndialogue )\nMusic for Minstrelsy\nTaking it for granted that the would-be minstrels have reasonably\ngood voices, the only difficulty will be “selection ” Of course a great\ndeal of tact is required to know what class of music is best suited to\nthe audience Have as much variety as possible Do not confine yourself\nexclusively to comic songs or to sentimental ditties alone At all costs\nkeep your audience cheerful and amused Too much humor is apt to\nnauseate, but too much melancholy will certainly spell failure Try to\ngauge the temper of your company, and if they seem to prefer the\nserious to the comic parts on your programme, or vice versâ, make as\nquick and effective an alteration as you can They must be made to\nappreciate you—not simply to tolerate you To have a piano accompaniment is a distinct acquisition if the\nvoices be of doubtful merit For accomplished singers a banjo is quite\nsufficient, but the amateur will certainly find that a friend at the\npiano is very handy and reliable This is, of course, entirely a matter\nof individual taste and circumstances A very good selection of nigger dialogues, speeches, &c , can be\nobtained from any theatrical publisher The entertainer will be\nfurnished with useful ideas for a programme, including some of the\nmost successful minstrels’ songs and drolleries As the Stump Orator would say, “We must now draw a delusion to\nour not over long lecture,” feeling confident that the amateur nigger\nwill find his entertainment as great a source of pleasure to himself as\nof amusement to the audience CHAPTER VIII\nTABLEAUX VIVANTS\nTrue-to-Life Representations\nTableaux may be divided into two important classes—the\nportrayal of abstract qualities, which usually includes motionless\nfigures posed in sustained attitudes, and historic and romantic groups,\nin which the actor is allowed some occupation The Hero The Martyr The first class is most difficult of successful achievement In it, the\nwhole gamut of emotions common to mankind may be symbolized,\nand in these attitude and gesture are governed by the mind, which\nshould be revealed in every muscle, curve, and limb of the human\nframe The Ascetic The Fanatic Strength, courage, fidelity, chivalry, purity, and honesty should be\nposed in such a manner that the simple grandeur and dignity of these\nattributes cannot be mistaken The hero, the martyr, the ascetic, the\nfanatic have each a commonly recognized type and pose The shrinking form of the coward—he who fears all things greater\nthan himself—must bear the stamp of the puny soul unveiled The eye\nof the hypocrite, the cunning, the evil and degraded, is as different\nfrom the gaze of the pure of heart as the muddy, stagnant pool is\ndifferent from the wide, blue expanse of salt sea—the air of a foul\nroom from the breath inhaled beneath the open sky And in the same way that grand music is expressive of all human\nemotions, and as welcome to the ear as the song of birds, so form and\ncolor, attitude and character, in living pictures are potent emblems of\nthe strength and weakness of complex humanity The figure that is to symbolize Hope must possess that wondrous\nattribute in herself, otherwise no trickery of dress or limelight can\nmake her anything but a caricature of the spirit of optimism So that, in order to portray virtues and vices as they are, the stage\nmanager’s craft reaches beyond superficial knowledge Psychology\nand intuition are even more important to him than experience\nregarding blending of colors, arrangement of lights and grouping of\nforms, for the human mind is the keynote in which his music is\nrevealed, the touchstone of his secret, the mystic spirit dominating the\nsymmetry of gesture In the choice of individuals, personal character is weighty—pink\nand white flesh tints, however perfectly blended in a face, do not\nstand for Patience, Charity, or Sympathy unless the heart behind is\npulsed on the pivot-springs of these virtues, for the experienced eye of\nthe spectator probes beyond paint and attitude, and knows perfectly\nwell whether these virtues are rightly embodied or merely distorted\nmimicry Therefore the stage manager of tableaux vivants, before all else,\nneeds penetration in recognizing and choosing exponents suitable to\ninterpret the abstract conditions he is anxious to depict, and it is only\nwhen his choice is made that the training, grouping, and scenic effects\nneed be considered Tableaux vivants are in character not unlike a symphony The\ntheme in both is important In the latter, the interweaving of other\nparts enhances the beauty of the dominating strain, as in the former,\nwhere harmonizing colors and stage effects, important as they are,\nremain ever subordinate to the principal conception aspired Of course, in the training of subjects, it is very necessary that one\nattitude should be maintained by each figure and remain unbroken\nfrom the lift to the fall of the curtain, and this without rigidity of\nbody, unless the characteristic is typified in rigid lines; but even more\nimportant is the necessity that the mind should not waver nor the\nfeatures change to an expression not in harmony with the attribute\ntypified Hope does not frown or smile, and all nervous twitching is absent\nfrom the tranquil face and figure of Serenity Courage shows a lofty\nbrow and steady eye—the shoulders are squared resolutely, but not\naggressively Mercy, Pity, Love, Gentleness, Sweetness, and Charity are most\nperfectly imaged by women, who naturally possess these virtues;\nDignity, Determination, Steadfastness, and Chivalry by men But the\nstage manager need not limit himself by any conventions in this\nparticular, for it sometimes happens that a woman’s face and form\n\n\nbreathe characteristics usually found in certain types of manhood,\nwhile a man’s countenance may be eloquent of the gentle virtues\ntypical of womanhood The thoughts of each character must be concentrated on the part\nundertaken, and the onlookers absolutely forgotten As far as possible\nthe actors should forget that there is a certain amount of strain in the\nimmovable pose, otherwise limbs will twitch and the balance and\npose be in peril With sufficient practice it will not be difficult to\nremain in the attitude fixed upon for the few minutes after the curtain\nis lifted It is only at first that the limbs, either through inexperience\nor nervousness, prove rebellious The impersonators should not be\nafraid to breathe regularly, for this prevents artificial rigidity Figures should not be crowded together A small stage, such as\nwould be used in a drawing-room, requires a picture in proportion The dresses and lights should blend harmoniously with the\nbackground and frame Staging\nFig 1 depicts the lighting arrangement at back of frame The guard-\nwires, running from side to side, are to prevent the possibility of\ndresses catching fire The footlights usually consist of ordinary night-\nlights with illumination glass covers Behind these are tin shades for\nreflectors Electric light, if available, can be substituted for oil lamps\nas shown In the same sketch a curtain-raising apparatus also appears Two persons should be chosen for its manipulation, and be always\nstationed in such a position that they can draw and divide the curtain\nat the given signal Every separate production is timed by the stage manager or some\nother reliable person, and the duration of each should be exact Three,\nor at the most four, minutes are ample time for the audience to take\nin the details of the picture, and the instant the curtain is drawn\nanother group is arranged, the actors being perfectly familiar with the\nposition and pose they are to take, going to their places without\nconfusion or disorder In a succession of group-pictures different groups of actors are\nnecessary, for it is impossible for the same persons to change their\ncostumes in the minute or so that intervenes before the succeeding\nspectacle Where the number of players amounts to fifteen, twenty, or twenty-\nfive, the number of tableaux arranged upon can be divided between\nthem, and the productions, consisting of from two to five figures,\narranged in such a way that during group A’s tableaux group B is\nready in the wings and takes the stage the instant group A disappears\nthrough a different exit to the dressing-room Next, group C takes\ngroup B’s place in the wings, and so on with all the groups In this\nway each has a few minutes in which to change Fig 1 —Lighting arrangement for back of frame",
    "—Lighting arrangement for back of frame Confusion and fussing will be prevented by each group knowing\nexactly their manner and mode of entrance Some plan, which renders\nit impossible for group A leaving the stage to collide with group B in\nthe wings, must be fixed upon Because the tableaux take place in a\nstrange drawing-room, where there is not much accommodation\npossible behind the platform, and few entrances and exits, is no\nadequate excuse for any bungling or confusion However limited the space, the stage manager and his company\nshould hit upon some plan that makes for order and precision To do\nthis, the performers should come early to rehearse entrances and\nexits, and then memorize them, for any mistake behind the scene,\neven if of so slight a character that it does not retard the productions,\nis apt to disturb the nerves of the players, and rob them of their\nnecessary calm There should be no laughing or talking, for sounds easily penetrate\nthrough a drawing-room, and not only disturb the audience, but draw\nfrom their task the attention of the group occupying the stage The stage manager, who feels unable to represent abstract qualities\nperfectly, would do well to avoid them altogether It may happen that his actors include a few who are absolutely raw\nmaterial where tableaux are concerned, and upon such occasions he\nshould always have a few studies in his repertoire in which motionless\nposes are not necessary Penelope and Ulysses\n\n\nFor example, a pretty novice, sitting at a spinning-wheel, weaving\nimaginary threads from a spindle of flax, will do very well as\nPenelope, spinning her endless garment during the absence of Ulysses In a simple white or colored gown, with her hair falling over her\nshoulders, and her head bent slightly over the wheel, she makes a\npleasing picture Cinderella, seated on the floor, gazing into the cinders, with her\nhands clasped round her knees, is another quite easily adopted\nattitude Another pretty scene, acted over the spinning-wheel, is the Lady of\nShalott, weaving “a magic web with colors gay,” and peering from\ntime to time at the mirror above her, which reflects “the highway\nnear, winding down to Camelot ”\nIn this tableau the facial expression is wholly different from that\nwhich dominates Penelope’s features Penelope’s labor is inspired by\nstratagem, to keep her unwelcome suitors at bay Her soul is steeped\nin a patience so melancholy that it verges on despair, whereas the\nLady of Shalott “weaves by night and day,” because she believes she is\nchained to her task by an awful power If she pauses a moment, a\ncurse will fall upon her Her eyes, therefore, are wild with fear, her\nface contorted, her fingers pluck the threads feverishly, and there is\nnone of Penelope’s listlessness in her wild agonized concentration History and fiction teem with incidents that can be easily translated\ninto groups, wherein an absolutely motionless attitude is not required The three witches in “Macbeth,” in their cone-shaped hats, tattered\nrags, and disheveled hair, their wild, evil prophecy, seared in the deep\nlines of their withered faces, haunched on the ground conspiring\ntogether Guinevere, prone on the convent floor of “the holy house at\nAlmesbury”; King Arthur, fully armed, and stained with battle,\nbending over her in agonized tenderness, pity, and shame; and many\nother examples, which will easily be found by the stage manager,\nambitious to exhibit pictures more unique than those usually adopted Stage “Props”\nThe materials used for characters need not be expensive or difficult\nto procure Cheap sateens, muslins, velveteens, gold paper pasted over\n\n\ncardboard and large buttons, glass diamonds and emeralds, tinsel and\nsilver braid, bright-colored ribbons from the remnant basket,\ndiscarded shoes and stockings, transformed by cheap dyes, vari-\ncolored beads, imitation ermines, tin swords and armor—all these are\nuseful and effective beneath the lime-light Backgrounds may be arranged by means of curtains draped over the\nwalls in colors that blend or contrast harmoniously as desired with the\ntableau produced Properties, such as old wine flagons, lamps, &c ,\nmay be fashioned by means of cardboard, cut in the necessary shape,\ngummed together, and covered with gold or silver paper Fig 2 —Tiers for back-stage grouping Fancy dress magazines and illustrated histories will reveal many\nsecrets to the stage manager Better still, a visit to a museum, when he\nis in doubt about the shape and period of some article he requires,\nand observation of the properties utilized in historic or Shakespearean\nplays will well repay time and trouble spent Duplicates in lead, wood,\nor tin of almost any old article can be fashioned well enough to\nanswer his purpose When a large group of figures is to be arranged, light wooden\nladders, placed in a semicircle, and covered with some appropriate\ncolor, make easy and adaptable tiers, on each step of which a figure is\nposed, or an arrangement of tiers for back-stage grouping can be\nmade as shown in Fig 2 The most expensive aids in the stage manager’s paraphernalia—and\nthese, alas, there is no overcoming—are the supply of the lime-light\nand the loan of the wigs But in this direction he should not be too\nambitious, contenting himself at the start with a moderate outfit in\naccordance with his means and inexperience CHAPTER IX\nCHARADES\nAn Old Favorite for Indoor Parties\nOne of the most popular indoor entertainments for winter evenings,\nor indoor parties, both with children and “grown-ups,” is charades Not only do they afford amusement to the audience, but the players\nthemselves obtain a good deal of fun from their efforts to baffle those\nwho are listening to them Suppose, for instance, that a “party” is composed of some twenty\npeople About five or six of them are selected to go outside, choose a\nword, which can easily be split into syllables, each making a word in\nitself The players must not waste too much time in planning how best to\nact the words, or the audience will show signs of impatience This can\nalso be averted by the hostess arranging for a musical, or other little\n“stop-gap” to fill up the time which must necessarily elapse between\nthe moment when the players retire and their subsequent appearance Having thought of a little sketch which will take in all the several\nparts of the word chosen, the players arrange impromptu scenery and\nstart the first act, taking care to bring in the first syllable, and yet not\ngiving it undue prominence This care must be observed all the way\nthrough the charade, as the fun is much greater when the listeners\ncannot guess the word too easily If the word chosen is “Indignation,” it is split into three syllables—\nIn, dig, nation These words having been acted, in the last scene the complete word\nis brought in, and as it is through this act the audience will listen most\ncarefully for a clew, the players, if they wish to baffle them, should do\ntheir best to bring in a variety of words in order to mislead the\nlisteners In many cases a little scenery adds considerably to the successful\npresentation of charades A “window” frequently proves of service But it may happen that the end of the room where the actual window\nis situated does not lend itself conveniently to the performance of the\ncharade, and in this circumstance the best plan is to improvise an\n\n\n“artificial window,” which, being portable, can be used in any\nrequired position An “Artificial Window”\nA start can be made in construction by procuring a sheet of strong\nwhite paper of the requisite size With India ink or chalk the thick\nblack lines, as shown in Fig 1, are painted in The dotted lines\nrepresent the sheet of paper, the four holes the positions at which the\nnails fasten it to the wall, and the finished effect of an interior\nwindow is obtained by the draping of art muslin or curtains, as\nsuggested by the diagram Oftentimes a little exterior scene is wanted A simple way of\nimprovising a cottage is that of using two screens placed as shown (A,\nA, Fig 2) A plank or the shelf of a cupboard is placed across the top\n(D, Fig 2), and kept in position either by nails or gimlets screwed into\nthe top of the screens A tablecloth of any bright color, preferably red, is stretched from\npoints (B, B, Fig 3), slanting downwards and slightly over the edge of\nthe screens Fig 1 —Interior artificial window for charades Two “artificial windows” (C, C, Fig 3) should be then pinned to the\nscreens, and the exterior of cottage is complete, an additional artistic\neffect being produced by fixing flower-stands with ferns in positions\nas shown (E, E, Fig 2) Fig 2 —Plan for improvised cottage Fig 3 —Exterior view of improvised cottage “A Seaside Scene”\n\n\nAt first sight it might seem out of the question to produce a really\npassable scene representing “the rolling deep ” This may be easily\ncarried out, however, by a careful study of Fig 4, and the\nrequisitioning of such commonplace articles as a large white sheet,\nwhich is stretched and nailed to the wall, a few rolls of stout white-\nbacked wall-paper, hassocks, boxes, and old brown or gray cloths Fig 4 —A sea scene The wall-paper is cut into three lengths corresponding with the\nwidth of the sheet, one about 18 inches in depth (A, Fig 4), the next\n28 inches (B, Fig 4), and the third 34 inches (C, Fig 4) At each end a piece of wood is fastened (D, Fig 4), behind which is\nglued a block of wood or small weighted box (E, Fig 4) The lengths of paper, marked A and B, are cut in zig-zag fashion at\nthe top in order to produce the appearance of waves, the effect being\nenhanced by an application of blue paint used as shown in the\ndiagram The strip of paper marked C forms the horizon, therefore the\ntop of this should be left straight and painted blue to a depth of about\n10 inches To complete the effect, boxes, hassocks, and stools of different\nheights are grouped round and covered with the gray cloths to\nrepresent rocks (F, F, Fig 4) An empty barrel and a few coils of rope flung carelessly about help\nto make a more realistic scene, and well guarded lamps placed\nbetween the slips representing waves throw them up into necessary\nprominence A Portable Tent\nFig 5 —A portable tent A portable tent is made from a few sheets of brown paper glued\ntogether to form a huge square (A, A, A, A, Fig

often find a place in\ncharades Fig 6 —A highwayman’s mask Fig 7 —Highwayman’s leggings On a width of black sateen or any other suitable material a design is\ndrawn as shown in Fig 6, marked with chalk and cut away to fit the\nface A piece of thin black tape is fixed to either side, so that the mask\nmay be tied round the head just above the ears Amongst the highwayman’s outfit there must certainly be a pair of\nhigh boots, but as these are not found in every household, it may be\nas well to give a few simple directions for the making of them From several sheets of stout brown paper four pieces of the shape\nindicated at (A, Fig 7), are cut So that the tops of the boot shall not\ncrack when the leg is bent, small pieces of paper are gummed at either\nside, as shown (B, Fig 7) Only the fixing of a piece of tape, or double fold of the paper for the\ninstep, remains to be done (C, Fig 7), and an excellent pair of\nhighwayman’s boots is to hand Fig 8 —Highwayman’s hat An ordinary pliable felt or straw hat can be easily and quickly\ntransformed into a three-cornered highwayman’s hat A study of Fig 8\n\n\nwill explain where the stitches are to be taken from the brim to the\ncrown A Policeman’s Helmet\nTwo hard felt derby hats properly treated make an excellent\nrepresentation of a policeman’s helmet, which will very often be\nfound useful for charade acting It is first of all necessary to cut off the brim of one of the hats at the\npoint where the band comes The crown of the second one is also cut\noff, but some three inches above the band Fig 9 —Front and back view of a policeman’s helmet The first crown is next carefully fitted over the brim portion of the\nother one, and tacked round firmly so that the two pieces do not slip The headgear now presents the appearance of an abnormally high\nderby hat The curved part of the brim is cut away, and the front shaped to a\npoint, as shown in Fig 9, and the brim at the back is nicely rounded The usual ornamentation may be suggested by the application of\nchalk, the addition of a large-sized wooden button mold glued to the\ntop of the crown, a chin-strap of shiny black leather completing the\narticle Fig 10 —Skull cap, pigtail, and hat for Chinaman A Chinaman’s Head Covering\nA Chinaman is a character quite easily portrayed, and one which\ncan be simply represented by pressing into service articles of everyday\nuse From a piece of pale pink sateen the head covering (A, Fig 10) is\nfashioned, a string run through at C to be drawn out or in at will; and\na piece of rope or twist of darning cotton, B, sewn on at the back for a\n\n\npigtail Then if the would-be Chinaman wishes to cover his head still\nfurther, the lid of the linen basket provides him with a hat, when a\npiece of braid or black paper has been fixed to the rim, and a string\nsewn on for the chin-strap A highly-colored dressing jacket and a pair of rather loose white\ntrousers complete the Chinaman’s outfit Advertisement Charades\nWhilst some people consider the ordinary charades the best fun,\nthere are others equally ready to admit that they prefer the “dumb”\nrepresentation of words chosen, one of the most popular of these\nbeing the “advertisement” charade, wherein some well-known poster\nis chosen and acted in silence A well-known soap advertisement which has been so popular for\nyears serves as an excellent illustration There are few, if any, who\ncould not recall the picture",

    "can be seen any day selling matches at his post in Times\nSquare And talking of the importance of trivialities, reminds me of an\nadventure that befell me the other day I had hired a taxi-cab, and\nwas just stepping into it——,” &c , &c , thus introducing quite a\ndifferent anecdote Now, the outlines of the incident of Mr A ’s dinner-party are taken\nfrom a comic paper, but twisted and colored to suit the requirements\nof the artist; and there are many stories that may be dished up in\nsimilar manner, while frequently personal experiences are extremely\nhumorous when rightly treated The “All in All”\nThe artist should study and cultivate the correct and various\nmethods of telling a story, remembering Pope’s\nadage—\n“For style is all in all, whate’er is writ,\nThe substitute for genius, sense, and wit ”\nIf the style of writing is important, how much more is the manner\nof verbal narration The wittiest story may fall to pieces in the hand of\nthe inartistic, while the most trivial incident humorously handled may\nbe greeted with shrieks of merriment The raconteur must give his audience the impression of frank\ngeniality and friendliness without familiarity, his attitude cunningly\neloquent of the man who is about to open his heart to a confidante Orchestra chairs and gallery are his bosom friends He twinkles and\npatters at them right merrily If he paints their peculiarities or laughs\nat their social ways he must flavor his babbling with the tender fun of\nthat greatest of humorists, Charles Lamb, who never aped or scoffed\nat physical deformity, and was never cynical at another’s expense The caricatures depicted by mimicry must be cleansed of that sour\nVoltaire bitterness and cruelty, the artist always remembering that he\n\n\nis performing in order to beguile, and he must cultivate that delicate\ntact which prevents him from imitating the withered idiosyncrasies\nsupposed to be typical of the old maid in the drawing-room, when he\nknows that some spinster relative or friend is present The public possesses a vast fund of humor, and there is nothing it\nloves so much as a hearty laugh, but its risibilities should be handled\nas delicately as a trout is tickled, and if they are only provoked at the\ndear expense of some unfortunate individual, they are coarse and\nvulgar, and the artist himself is culpable The broad double meanings\nof apparently innocent witticisms one might have heard at some\nvaudeville halls should be rigorously avoided There are gentlemen,\nfine-souled and clean of mind, in your gallery as in your orchestra\nchairs Treat them as such Appeal to the best, to the refined sense of\nthe ludicrous that lurks in every mind, and you will be as welcome in\nthe most select drawing-room as in the theater Humor and fun are as bracing and purifying a tonic as a breath of\nsea air They should be steeped in the salt ozone of wit, but never in\nthe withering blight of vulgarity",
    "They should be steeped in the salt ozone of wit, but never in\nthe withering blight of vulgarity An Artist—and a Gentleman\nThe artist should be large-souled and natural in attitude and gesture\n—a gentleman from head to heel in the best sense of the word—and\nthe result will brace up and encourage him, for he will observe the\nfaded city merchant laughing with the heart-whole abandon of the\nchild It is not necessary, and it may become even monotonous, to pose\nforever as the comedian who sees fun in every incident around him A\ngreat and versatile artist, now deceased, in the middle of his recital\nwould sit down at the zither when the room was still ringing with\nlaughter, provoked by his keen shafts of humor, and win tears by the\nexquisite pathos of the refrain: “The mill will never grind with the\nwater that is past ”\nMaudlin melodrama is not pathos any more than vulgar mockery is\nhumor A thin veil lies between tears and laughter, and both are\nnearer the surface than some artists realize Both are noble and\nwholesome, and so should never be made puny by too little giving or\nrendered grotesque by too much A most effective means of self-accompaniment is the harp, and one\n\n\nmoreover which adapts itself exquisitely to the subtle charm and\nchanging qualities of the human voice, but only in the performer’s\nmore serious moments To twang at this instrument and pose above it\nin the attitude of the comedian, to pluck it banjo fashion, is to\ndisplease and jar the sensibilities of the most uninitiated of the\naudience The dual art is a stumbling-block to many a versatile artist, and its\nperfection needs a tremendous amount of persevering and diligent\npractice There are some gifted performers to whom the art of\npattering or reciting to music is inborn, and so extremely facile, but to\nthe less fortunate it presents discouraging obstacles, and the power of\nimprovising an accompaniment suitable to the anecdote or poem\nrelated is not given to the majority However, the student should remember and be encouraged by the\nfact that “steady effort attracts unknown powers to our aid,” and work\non determinedly until the difficulty is mastered In studying the dual art, the beginner is apt to hammer the words to\nthe accompaniment, or the accompaniment to the words, and it seems\nat first impossible to arrive at that perfect blending of voice and music\nwhich is essential to this kind of performance Another extremely\ncommon fault is to emphasize the wrong word or the wrong note,\nwith the result that the achievement becomes meaningless The ear should be trained to the rôle of an exacting critic, and when\nthis power is developed it will demonstrate faithfully wherein the\nfailure of co-operation lies Music should never be suffered to overburden the words of the\npoem or anecdote related It is usually but a ground-work upon which\nthe artist builds, “at most, an undercurrent of answering emotion ”\nThe instant it flows through the floodgates of restraint it obliterates\nthe meaning and the sense of the words as the waters of a burst dam\nobliterate the natural features of dry land Another serious fault to be found in the rendition of the\ninexperienced student is permitting the time of his accompaniment to\nswing into his voice Against this he must be severely on his guard, or\nhe will develop a wearisome habit of chanting in monotone While taking pains to blend his voice with his accompaniment, he\nmust take equal care to keep both distinct and apart This sounds\nparadoxical, but practice and self-criticism will prove that both are\ntrue and possible Music and Words\nThe speaker should learn to harmonize his music so exquisitely with\nhis words that to the uninitiated the accompaniment seems rather\nextempore improvising than the result of toil and diligence As a\nmatter of fact, it is extremely rare that even the greatest artists dare\ntrust to the inspiration of the moment to provide them with adequate\naccompaniment An artist may have a theme or motif borrowed from some\ncomposer, and he may be sufficiently gifted to plan it out and develop\nit for himself, but always with careful thought and deliberation before\nhe gives it public expression The dual art is as full of vagaries and traps as the French language,\nand at first the student who finds himself handicapped by inability to\nconquer it, cannot do better than study some poems written to music,\nand at these he must work steadily before he attempts to patter to\naccompaniment A few musical poems mastered will go far to secure him an air of\nease and self-possession Correct attitude at piano For instance, undertake some such study as Racine’s tragedy of\n“Athalie,” which has been so exquisitely set to music by Mendelssohn In the opening bar of “Allegro Moderato,” a few notes are played to\nintroduce the passage, “Where do those women and their children\ngo ” Then there are a few more notes, followed by the words, “The\nLord hath laid the queen of cities low ”\nThe four succeeding bars are treated in the same way The music\nceases while “Her priests are captives” is recited Then a chord is\nstruck, and the voice goes on unaccompanied, “Her monarchs are\nrejected ” Another chord, “Her godly rites forsaken, unprotected ” The\nsixth bar opens with a chord, and is followed by the words, “Down,\ntemple Cedars, down ” and terminates with four semi-quavers This is an intensely dramatic poem, written in rhymed\nAlexandrines, and the student must take great care not to rend the\nwords from the accompaniment, or the accompaniment from the\nwords The short phrases and detached chords must punctuate and\nemphasize the sentences, and lend weight and finish to the whole This is not a difficult task when compared with such a study as “The\nDream of Jubal,” in which the music accompanies the words in strict\ntime, the combination of voice and pianoforte flowing smoothly, the\ncomponents dependent and yet never waiting for each other The only way to reach perfection is to study the poem and music\nseparately at first, until the student is fairly familiar with both Then\ncontinue them with the aid of a metronome until the technicalities of\nthe mechanism, which include correct emphasis, pauses, and rhythm,\nand the proper flow of the phrases, are mastered When this has been frequently rehearsed, the student may try his\npowers without the metronome, and gradually, but surely, he will\nmaster the antagonistic forces arrayed against him The artist who possesses a natural gift of composition will find it\nextremely useful, for there are many exquisite poems which, although\nseeming to clamor for a musical accompaniment, have not yet been\ntouched; but this combination is fraught with perils, and those who\napproach it must be for ever wary of the grotesque and unfit In burlesque, of course, the artist has great license in the matter of\naccompaniment He may exaggerate and slash his pianoforte (taking\n\n\ncare never to drown his voice), and achieve the absolutely absurd and\nludicrous, but, in the poems or patter that need delicacy, lightness of\ntouch, melancholy cadences or bubbling, merry notes, he cannot be\ntoo careful in the theme he chooses to aid and color his portrayal In\nsuch pieces, the right attitude, the right gesture, the right expression\nmust be studied and gripped, so as to add their subtle beauty to the\nwhole The accompanying sketch shows the correct attitude at the\npiano, or rather, the attitude generally adopted by the professional\nmusical-sketch artist The body is turned “three-quarters” to the\naudience, the head full-faced, the left foot working the pedals, while\nthe right usually follows the direction in which the performer is\nlooking CHAPTER XI\nVAMPING SIMPLIFIED\nAn Accompanist in an Hour\nWhilst \n“vamping,” \nor \nthe \nimprovising \nof \na \nmusical\naccompaniment, is considered by many anything but a classical\naccomplishment, yet those who can accompany in this way are a\ndecided help to a general or children’s party In either case among the guests will be found some who possess the\ngift of song, either comic or sentimental, but who lack the power or\nthe ability to play their own accompaniments Fig 1 —First chord Play First chord\nMoreover, it may happen that the services of a skilled pianist are\nnot available, and in these circumstances any one who can vamp will\nbe deemed a useful acquisition The object of this chapter is not to give either intricate or\ncomprehensive instruction, but rather to suggest, even to those who\nhave had no musical training, a few rules whereby they will be\nenabled to step into the breach occasioned by the absence of an\naccomplished player An ordinary piano has fifty notes, comprising A, B, C, D, E, F, G, in\nsucceeding order The whole keyboard is divided into two portions—treble and bass,\nthe former starting from the fourth C up from the left; the notes below\nthe fourth or middle C comprise the bass (See Fig 1 Arrow denotes\nmiddle C )\nEach black note above a white is its sharp, and each below its flat For example, taking the treble note G, the black note above it is G\nsharp, the one below it G flat Before starting to vamp to a song, the singer must hum over a line\n\n\nor so of the song in order that the “vampist” may keep both the time\nand tone in his mind for transference to the piano His ear will tell him when he has struck a few chords whether they\nare in the key in which the song is written If he finds that when a few\nbars of the song completing a distinct or rhythmical period have been\nhummed the note finished on is C, then he will know that the key is C,\nand find his chords as suggested by the diagrams given Vamping Chords and their Relative Changes\nThere are three principal chords in a key which are sufficient to\ncover the range of melody Starting in C, the first chord for the right\nhand from the little finger to the thumb is made up of the notes\nmiddle C, bass G, and bass E The left hand strikes the octave C\nimmediately below the right hand thumb on E (Fig 1 )\nThe second chord starts from little finger of right hand on F, first\nfinger on C, and thumb on A in bass, the octave F, below the right\nhand A, being struck in the bass (Fig 2 )\nFig 2 —Second chord\nPlay Second chord\nThe third chord starts with little finger of right hand on G, third\nfinger on F, and thumb on B in bass, the left hand striking the octave\nG below the B on which thumb of right hand is placed (Fig 3 )\nFig 3 —Third chord Play Third chord\nTo complete the melody it is necessary to go back to the chord\nstarted with, taking it up an octave or eight notes higher in both\nhands The relative changes are brought about by the use of the following\nchords Striking the F sharp with the little finger of right hand, the\n\n\nfirst finger is placed on the D, and the thumb upon middle C, the left\nhand taking the octave F sharp immediately below middle C (Fig 4 )\nFig 4 —First chord of relative change Play chord\nThe second change starts with little finger of right hand on G, first\nfinger on D, and thumb on B below middle C, the octave G in left\nhand completing the chord (Fig 5 )\nFig 5 —Second relative change Play chord\nAnother change is produced by the use of the next two chords Fig 6 —Another change Play chord\nStriking G sharp with the little finger of the right hand, the first\nfinger strikes E, and the thumb D; the octave G sharp being struck in\nthe bass by the left hand (Fig 6 )\nThe twin chord to the one just described is made by placing the\nright hand little finger on A, the first finger on E, and the thumb on\nmiddle C; the octave A, immediately below middle C, being struck by\nthe left hand (Fig 7 )\nFig 7 —Twin chord to that described in Fig 6 Play chord\nThe final change necessary is produced by the two following\nchords Fig 8 —First chord of third change Play chord\nThe little finger of the right hand is placed on C sharp, first finger\non A, and the thumb on G, both the latter notes being bass—that is,\nbelow middle C The left hand strikes the octave C sharp in the bass",
    "The left hand strikes the octave C sharp in the bass (Fig 8 )\nFig 9 —Final chord Play chord\nThe last chord is made by striking D above middle C with the little\nfinger of the right hand, A below middle C with the first finger, and F\nalso below middle C with the right hand thumb; the left hand takes\nthe octave D in the bass (Fig 9 )\nBy a study of the chords set forth above it is seen that the octave\nstruck by the left hand in every case is a lower tone of the note played\nby the little finger of the right hand—viz , if the little finger of the\nright hand strikes G in the treble, the octave G is played by the left\nhand in the bass An effective ending to a vamping accompaniment is brought about\nby the use of a “run ” Starting from the C in the bass below the middle\nC (indicated by arrow on diagram), and playing the E and G with first\nand second fingers, the thumb is taken under, on to the middle C and\nthe action repeated twice, the run finishing on the fourth C in the\ntreble (Fig 10 )\nFig 10 —Showing the “run” on piano embracing three chords Play “run”\nIt is useful and interesting to bear in mind that any chord can be\nmade by placing the little finger on a note desired, missing the next\ntwo covered by the second and third fingers, striking the note covered\nby first finger, missing the next, and striking the one covered by the\n\n\nthumb Having committed the above chords and “run” to memory, the\nperformer can play them to suit the time in which the accompanied\nsong is written CHAPTER XII\nAN EVENING AT THE PHONOGRAPH\nA Concert at Home\nTo possess a gramophone or phonograph is to be already furnished\nwith the means of giving a very successful and pleasurable\nentertainment There are so many “entertainments” that do not\nentertain, and so many “amusements” that do not amuse, that it is a\ndistinct relief to know where to turn when a mixed party of guests\nhave honored you with their presence",
    "There are so many “entertainments” that do not\nentertain, and so many “amusements” that do not amuse, that it is a\ndistinct relief to know where to turn when a mixed party of guests\nhave honored you with their presence With the number of gramophones, phonographs, talking-machines\nand zonophones now on the market, it is not the object of this chapter\nto specialize any particular make or type of article As in most things,\nquality means expense, and there is little use in hoping for fine results\nfrom a cheap machine Any respectable dealer will give useful advice\nas to the type of gramophone worth buying, and it must be left with\nyou to make your own choice Presuming you have obtained your machine and accustomed\nyourself to the manipulation of its various parts, the next point to be\nconsidered is how a successful programme may be carried out for an\nentertainment In nothing, perhaps, is that old adage that “tastes differ” so true as\nin music One person may shiver with disgust at everything but Bach,\nwhilst her neighbor probably can appreciate nothing but old ballads;\nor whereas paterfamilias beats time ecstatically to the familiar old\npieces of Verdi and Rossini which he remembers from his boyhood,\nhis cultivated son is impatient for something out of “Elektra ”\nNow it is the business of the entertainer to satisfy and please all\nthese people—to send none away empty, but to make each person feel\nwhat a pleasant evening he or she has had Whilst fully recognizing\nthe difficulty of producing this result, it is hoped that the following\nhints may serve to render the construction of a catholic programme a\nlittle easier than would at first appear Records are of two kinds—instrumental and vocal By blending\nthese successfully a very charming variety can be obtained which will\nmaterially assist in keeping the programme from lapsing into\n\n\nsameness Commence with a stirring overture or a rousing march that will set\nthe feet of your audience itching to mark time Avoid anything\ndreamy or languorous; let their attention be attracted by a bold\nstroke, by the rattle of drums and the blaring of cornets and\ntrombones Sousa’s marches, the “Stars and Stripes” for instance, are\nadmirable pieces to start the evening with, arousing the attention and\nstirring the blood of every healthy person in the room Having now excited the interest of your audience, give them some\nvocal music Choose a good quartette of well-known singers in a\nselection or song from some up-to-date opera, or even from one of the\nold Italian favorites “The Barber of Seville,” “La Bohême,” or “La\nTosca,” all provide very fine quartettes The next piece might be a good instrumental solo, on violin, ’cello,\npiccolo or clarionet Let it be short and characteristic; preferably a\npiece fairly well known to the majority of your audience At this point it may be remarked that people invariably like hearing\nwhat they already know The gramophone is more generally\nappreciated when it reproduces a song or piece of music that the\naudience has heard before; whilst the machine is scarcely suitable for\nthe introduction of wholly new music Of course it is impossible to\nform an entire programme on these lines, but when making the\nselection of records, if you bear this fact in mind it will save you from\nobtaining a number of outlandish pieces, if one may so style them,\nwhich the majority of your company has never heard before and will\nbe little likely to wish to hear again After the instrumental solo, it will be suitable to have a vocal solo—\nsay a soprano Again, select a good artist and a good song, for it is at\nthis point that your fiercest critics will be upon the lookout Do your\nbest to disappoint them of their prey by having none but the best\nsingers; and only then at their very best Humorous Songs\nWith a mixed company humorous songs are usually appreciated,\nand one may be very well introduced at this point The greatest care\nmust be exercised in avoiding anything that the most squeamish\nperson might think objectionable The number of perfectly harmless\n\n\nand refined comic songs is great, but unfortunately the number of\nvulgar songs is greater Accept nothing, therefore, that you have not\nheard yourself and know to be perfectly suitable A good piano solo may now be very serviceable, or even a piano\nand violin duet A piece of Chopin or Schumann, a short piece of\nGodard, or the like, is sure to be appreciated The most carping of\ncritics will be unable to find fault with the execution of Paderewski,\nHoffman, or other great pianists, all of whose records are easily\nobtainable A popular item from one of the current operas or musical comedies\nwill then be acceptable If the works of Sullivan are too antiquated,\nrecords of the more recent pieces recently running at the theaters can\neasily be had “Our Miss Gibbs,” “The Dollar Princess,” or the\n“Arcadians”—all will help to furnish you with some variety in the\nprogramme Choose a favorite that will bring up pleasant recollections\nto all who have seen the original play A tenor and bass duet may follow the above admirably, something\nrather pathetic—a love song or the like The task of making a choice\namongst so many songs of this class would be invidious, and it is left\nto the taste and opportunities of the entertainer to select what seems\nbest for the occasion It is now time for another piece of orchestral music, and a good\nwaltz is suggested—“The Merry Widow,” or something of that kind,\nplayed by a good band, and of a rather catchy nature If you divide the entertainment into two parts, the familiar\nintermezzo of the “Cavalleria Rusticana” makes a very suitable\noverture for the second part Obtain it on a good orchestra, and not as\na piano or violin solo Failing this any of Puccini’s overtures are good\nfor such an occasion The second part of the programme should be constructed on very\nmuch the same principles as the first A few classical pieces can be\nintroduced—Wagner and Grieg, Schubert and Elgar, and similar\ncontrasts Tenor, bass, soprano and contralto solos should be fitted in between\nthe heavier items, whilst instrumental solos are generally highly\nappreciated amongst really musical audiences Do not let the\nselections be too long, however Before closing the entertainment with “The Star Spangled Banner,”\nhave a good orchestral waltz to put every one in good humor General Arrangements\nAnd now for a few hints as to the actual performance Do not be too\nready to give encores Many people really dislike to hear a thing\ntwice, and unless you see there is a very general desire amongst your\naudience for a repetition, pass on to the next item immediately Have the seats comfortably arranged, and see that every one is\nseated before beginning your programme Copies of the programme\nshould be handed to each person present, and the name and number\nannounced before starting the machine Be careful that no hitch\noccurs in the arrangements",
    "Be careful that no hitch\noccurs in the arrangements Remember that the greatest of artists can be called to your\nassistance—Caruso, Melba, Patti, Albani, Tamagno (who though dead\nyet sings), Constantino, Tetrazzini, and numberless other great singers\nand musicians are at your beck and call, ready to sing to your friends\nor to exert their greatest talents on your behalf Avail yourselves of\nthem unsparingly, and you cannot miss success A Sunday programme is no more difficult to arrange Magnificent\nrecords of the “Messiah,” “Elijah,” and many other great oratorios can\nbe obtained, whilst numberless hymns and anthems are possible to the\ngramophone, sung by some of the finest choirs With these hints there should be no great difficulty in making a\nprogramme that will prove enjoyable to a mixed audience They are,\nhowever, but hints; to give exact instructions would be impossible The selection, even upon the lines sketched out in this chapter, must\nbe individual and adapted to the more immediate requirements of\nyour company, and in consequence no fixed rule for choice can be\ngiven CHAPTER XIII\nMUSICAL GLASSES\nA Great Inventor’s Hopes\nA hundred and fifty years ago the fashionable society of London\nwent mad over musical glasses When the cloth had been removed\nand the company were seated at the polished table, discussing the\ndessert and enjoying the rare old port, it was considered a great\nattainment, after having partially filled the finger-bowls, to be able to\nextract music by casually rubbing a finger around their rims Strange as it may seem, even the great composer Gluck did not\nconsider this musical trick beneath his genius, and used to pride\nhimself upon the skill he had acquired in this kind of performance Mozart composed a song to be played in this manner, and many\nfamous musicians devoted their energies to perfecting a branch of the\nscience which they considered to be full of promise Even Benjamin Franklin turned his genius to the subject, and after\nmany experiments succeeded in inventing an apparatus called a\nHarmonica, which he hoped would take its place amongst the\nrecognized musical instruments of his day From various causes,\nwhich shall be explained later, this invention was never attended with\nthe success its author anticipated Considerable knack is required to obtain a clear note from a glass A\nfine finger-bowl, preferably uncut, or a champagne glass, must be\npartly filled with water, and the performer should then damp his\nforefinger and also wet the rim of the glass If the finger now be\npassed lightly but firmly round a portion of the rim, after a few\ntouches a clear ringing sound will be produced If at first this is\ndifficult to obtain, pass the finger several times in one direction—e g from right to left, and then reverse from left to right Having done this\nfor a few seconds, the glass will, in all probability, begin to sound As has been said, quite a knack is requisite to perform this with any\nsuccess, but the beginner should not be discouraged if failure attends\nthe first few attempts, as, after a little practice, which seems to\nproduce nothing but a sad groaning noise, the glass will suddenly\nbegin to ring Having devoted a little patience to learning the exact\n\n\ntouch, the performer will find that the slightest movement of his\nfinger produces the desired note Little Water = Low Note\nThe note given out depends entirely upon the amount of liquid in\nthe glass The less water the lower will be the note; the more water\nthe higher it will be Therefore taking eight glasses, or fine finger-\nbowls, and filling each one to a different level with water, a complete\noctave can be obtained The amount of water to be placed in each depends entirely upon the\nsize of the bowl and the texture of the glass, and must therefore be\ndetermined by the performer himself A keen ear will soon enable him\nto get the glasses thoroughly in tune, and they can then be arranged\nbefore him in the order of the notes in the scale For those who desire to attain proficiency in this art, it would be\nwell to color the water distinctively in each glass, in a manner similar\nto the following:\n1 C\nclear\n2 D\nred\n3 E\nblue\n4 F\nyellow\n5 G\ngreen\n6 A\npurple\n7 B\norange\n8 C\nblack\n(See Fig 1 )\nBy this arrangement the performer can tell at a glance which glass\nhe must touch to obtain the note required This is more especially\napplicable to beginners, for, after some practice, the relative positions\nof the glasses become fixed in the mind, and he knows instinctively\nwhere to turn for whichever note is wanted Half-Notes\n\n\nHalf-notes can be made by adjusting the amount of water, which\ncan be colored accordingly; but for an ordinary entertainment the\noctave will be found quite sufficient, and at any rate to begin with,\nwill require all the musician’s attention When he can play quickly\nand correctly with his first eight glasses, he can introduce half-notes,\nbut it is very unwise to start with too many vessels, for it will give\nboth him and his audience far greater satisfaction to hear eight glasses\nplayed well than to hear a larger number played indifferently An important point to remember is to keep the finger and the rim\nthoroughly wet If this be borne in mind, the notes will come much\nmore easily and clearly, whilst the disagreeable droning sound will\nentirely disappear Care must also be taken to see that the glasses are\nsteady on their bases, as, in the case of champagne glasses, especially,\nthey are liable to tip up under the pressure of the finger With regard to the music suitable to musical glasses, it has already\nbeen mentioned that Gluck and Mozart composed songs for this class\nof performance, but the beginner is not recommended to attempt\nthese until he is very skillful As some time will elapse before he can\nplay even the scale with ease, perfectly simple music should be all\nthat he tries to learn at first When such easy, although somewhat\nhackneyed, pieces as “The Blue Bells of Scotland” and “Annie Laurie”\nhave been mastered, he can try more advanced works",
    "When such easy, although somewhat\nhackneyed, pieces as “The Blue Bells of Scotland” and “Annie Laurie”\nhave been mastered, he can try more advanced works Fig 1 —Showing finger-bowls containing various colored waters at different\nlevels, each level indicating a different note Many attempts have been made to discover some means of\nproducing the sound other than by rubbing the finger over the rim of\nthe glass Violin bows and other similar contrivances have all proved\nineffectual It would seem that the texture and surface of the human skin are\nalone suitable for this purpose, and nothing else has proved\nsuccessful This is the reason why musical glasses have not become\nmore common, for the continual rubbing of the wet finger over the\nsurface of the glass becomes after a time somewhat unpleasant However, this hardly applies to the short period that an ordinary\nperformer would devote to an entertainment Yet such was the reason\nthat caused the failure of Franklin’s instrument The following few bars of music, being the opening phrases of a\n\n\nwell-known song, will prove very suitable for glass music, especially\nwhen played at the dinner-table after the dessert has been discussed To simplify the matter for those who are not familiar with the usual\nnotation of music, the notes are given by name, thus enabling any one\nto pick them out with ease:\nE, E, E, F, F, G, F, E, D, E, F, G, C, F, E, D, C CHAPTER XIV\nHAND-BELL RINGING\nA Sweet-lipped Friend\nThere is something vital in the ordinary bell that dominates all of\nus It is an important factor in our lives The railway bell’s clamor\nreminds us that haste is needed to catch the departing train The\ndinner bell tells that the meal is ready for our consumption The\nchurch bell, the wedding chime, the fire bell, the tolling funeral bell,\nare all our faithful monitors and guardians, but the exquisite voice of\nthe hand-bell is the sweet-lipped friend that wooes us in our hour of\nease Hand-bell ringing is full of charm and interest, and it is astonishing\nof what changing harmonies these instruments are capable when\nmanipulated by dexterous hands Undertaken with perseverance and\npatience to overcome its rudimentary difficulties, this form of\ncampanology may be achieved with great success The first thing to do is to go to a well-known firm to secure the\nnecessary bells, which must be perfectly in tune The beginner needs\nonly a few, as for some time he must essay only the simplest tunes The best hand-bells are somewhat expensive, but to buy cheap inferior\ninstruments \nis \nfalse \neconomy \nand \nmost \nunsatisfactory, \nfor\nsonorousness and sweetness of tone depend upon purity of metal and\nperfect balance Those known as the “four-in-hand” consist of four hand-bells\nattached by means of a leather handle to one base This enables the\nplayer to manipulate eight bells at once Of course, by making careful\ninquiries, or by advertising, good second-hand sets of bells can be\nbought quite cheaply It is advisable that the bells be tuned to old Philharmonic pitch, C—\n540, and they should be fitted with improved pegged clappers The first step undertaken by the novice at bell-ringing is to consider\nand study the construction of the bell It is surmounted by a loop of\nleather, and the hinge of the clapper is so made that it can sound only\nwhen swayed towards the flat part of the handle The part of the\nclapper that touches the bell is composed of felt and not of metal, but\n\n\nthis alone is too light a material for the springs, which, it has been\ndiscovered, resist it To overcome this difficulty it is necessary that the felt should be\nweighted This achievement needs skill and experience, for the springs\nand weight naturally vary according to the size of the bell, and are in\nexact proportion, small springs being necessary for the small bells and\nlarge springs for the large ones Bell-ringing Companies\nBell-ringing companies consist of five players, and these are\ngenerally composed of two ladies and three gentlemen; all should be\nphysically strong and possessed of the sense of strict notation and\nmusic-reading ability The ladies generally undertake the alto and\ntenor parts The strongest player manages the bass bells, and the most\nreliable and cool-headed of the party the treble, which is divided into\nfirst and second, and is extremely important, needing no small\namount of agility and nerve, especially in difficult and intricate\npassages There are many reasons why five players are advisable Four could\nnot manage the full harmonies of treble, alto, tenor, and bass, while\nmore than five are apt to get in each other’s way, besides taking up\ntoo much space on a small platform in a drawing-room A long table, covered with some heavy material, such as thick baize\nor half-a-dozen pairs of good blankets, is essential Blankets are the\nbest They should not be spread out or divided, but folded upon the\nsurface, and then concealed by a cloth This keeps the sound from\nvibrating through the wood of the table, as the bells are placed upon\nit, at the termination of each note The bells must be in easy reach of the ringer, and the company just\nformed will do well to chalk lines upon the cloth to divide their\npositions from that occupied by the neighbor’s bells Tenor and alto players should occupy the center of the table Their\nwork, compared with that of bass and treble, is light and subordinate,\nand this is why those parts may be undertaken by ladies The second\ntreble stands at the right end, next to the alto, and the first treble and\nbass occupy the head and bottom of the table, as shown in Fig 1 Immediately after the bell is used the player must be careful to\nreplace it in its former position in the chalked space, or confusion and\n\n\ndiscord will be the result, as it is almost impossible to remember the\nposition of the bells unless this plan is strictly adhered to To pick up\nthe wrong bell will lead to disaster Audience Player\n○\nBass\nbells The Table Bells not in\nuse First\ntreble\nbells Player\n○\nTenor\nbells Alto\nbells Second\ntreble\nbells Player ○\nPlayer ○\nPlayer\n○\n \nFig 1 Many plans have been tried in which to place the bells so that each\nplayer may identify the different bells to be used Perhaps the simplest\nand most usually adopted is to arrange them in rows upon the table Supposing the number of bells required to be fifteen, place them in\nthree lines of five For the first row employ the letters of the alphabet;\nfor the second, even rows of figures; for the last, single odd figures,\nthus:—\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n○\n○\n○\n○\n○\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n○\n○\n○\n○\n○\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n\n\n○\n○\n○\n○\n○\nFig 2 This plan should be learnt, and the position of the bells be as fixed\nand relative to each other as the notes of the keyboard of the\npianoforte At first the players stand with the left side turned slightly\nto the table, but frequently they will be obliged to change their\npositions, sometimes turning to the right and sometimes facing the\ntable The bell should never be placed with the flat side of its handle\ntowards the manipulator, for in this position it cannot be struck,\nhowever much waved In holding the bell, the thumb must be pressed on the rivet, the\nfingers gripping the flat side of the handle When lifting the bell, the\nhandle should slope towards the body, thus forcing the weight of the\nclapper to swing to the side opposite to that upon which the strike\nsounds The bell, being lifted in this position, is not struck, the hand\nchanging its inclination from left to right In so doing, the bell is\nturned to an opposite angle, the clapper falls, and the strike is\nachieved by a slight impetus of the arm or wrist The student should practice lifting and striking the bell with\nalternate hands, until it is as easy to manage it with the left hand as\nthe right When he has mastered this difficulty he may try the\nworking of two bells—one in each hand, lifting one bell while the\nother is struck, taking care, however, always to place them in such a\nposition that no turning or twisting of the handle is necessary before\naction, as this involves loss of time, and makes him liable to constant\nblunders when he takes part in a tune The length of the table varies according to the number of bells\nrequired and the style of music undertaken Forty-four bells are\nsufficient for most simple melodies and exercises, and for them the\nspace required is about 11 feet by 5 feet “Flourishing”\n“Flourishing” the bells is impossible in quick music, and is only\nundertaken in slow passages, when the notes are to be sustained In\n\n\nworking the bells alternately, the dying vibration of one bell must\nnever be allowed to mingle with the next, for this is even more\ndiscordant than when, in pianoforte playing, a pedal is kept down too\nlong, and makes the vibration of one chord jar into the next To prevent this, the vibrating bell should be placed on the table\nimmediately before the other is about to be struck, but not in such a\nmanner as to rob the note of its proper value In a staccato passage,\non the contrary, the bells should be set quickly on the table as soon as\nthey have sounded In practicing the ringing of alternate bells, make each vibration the\nvalue of a semibreve, then a minim, and lastly a crotchet, until perfect\ndexterity is achieved,\nthus:—\nMusic\nPlay semibreve (1)\nminim (2)\ncrotchet (3)\nWhen the trebles are divided, the first treble plays the notes turned\nupwards, and the second treble the downward tailed—thus, in the\nscale of\nC:—\nMusic\nPlay music\nThe notes should follow without any break as continuously and\nsmoothly as though one player were ringing the scale Ringing two bells in each hand is difficult of accomplishment In\norder to do this successfully, one bell is lifted and gripped in the right\nhand by the first and second fingers and struck downward Then\nanother bell is inserted between the thumb and first finger, the flat\npart of the handles at right angles The first bell is again struck down,\nwhen it will be discovered that the second bell remains silent until it\nis slightly turned from left to right by a quick wrist movement, while\nin its turn the first bell gives no sound, simply because it needs a\n\n\ndownward stroke, and the side stroke, which gives voice to the second\nbell, is in a contrary direction Extreme care and perseverance are necessary before these two bells\ncan be properly manipulated, and a great number of exercises which\nthe student can construct for himself should be practiced Chromatic notes present great difficulty, especially in more\nadvanced music, and can only be mastered gradually In simpler\npassages, when they occur, the student should place the chromatic\nbells in the back row in the order in which they are to be used If his\nchromatics are arranged (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and he has memorized\ntheir position beforehand, he will have no difficulty in finding them as\nthey are required A company of bell-ringers should have a large répertoire of music of\nas much variety as possible Many of the pieces which are most\nsuitable are somewhat hackneyed, and yet are cordially welcomed\nwhen musically treated, and other works can always be arranged for\nplaying Tone, expression, and phrasing are all-important The rhythm of\nsounds must not alter with the changing of the bells It must continue\nin a sweet flow of music, just as if one hand were manipulating every\nbell The jerk, the overlong pause, or the lack of tone in one player’s\nwork, has power to mar the whole performance In large orchestras constant playing together is necessary for proper\nunion and harmonizing of sounds, and this is equally essential in bell-\nringing It must ever be remembered that “practice makes perfect,”\nand the blending of the bells needs unending patience and persistence For beginners such pieces as “The Minstrel Boy,” “She Wore a\nWreath of Roses,” “Home, Sweet Home,” “The Last Rose of Summer,”\nand the National Anthem prove stepping-stones to enterprises of a\nmore complicated nature, and should be carefully studied, for\n“vaulting ambition” is quite out of the question in the art of hand-bell\nringing CHAPTER XV\nTHE ART OF DRAWING-ROOM SINGING\nCorrect Breathing and Voice Production\nFig 1 A Hard\npalate B Soft\n„\nD Uvula E Tongue One of the most delightful sounds in the drawing-room is the music\nof the human voice, uplifted in song to a soft pianoforte\naccompaniment, if, of course, the voice be tuneful, easily produced,\nand sympathetic, and the breathing taken without effort The first steps to be considered in singing are (1) correct breathing,\n(2) voice production, (3) clear pronunciation The tongue should be\nhollowed behind the teeth, not rolled up in a ball, thus closing the\nvocalist’s throat The uvula, so called because of its supposed likeness\nto a grape, should be lifted to the roof of the soft palate, the mouth\npresenting a hollow open chamber, through which the notes issue in\nclear, bell-like tones (Fig 1) The beginner will find this a difficult matter, and effort and will are\nneeded to keep the tongue down and the uvula up The position of the\nformer may be demonstrated by means of the handle of a teaspoon\npressed against it The tongue will prove rebellious until practice\nmakes it perfectly easy and natural to subdue it in the necessary\nmanner In breathing, inhale a long slow breath through the nose only,\nkeeping the mouth closed The air should originate in the upper part\nof the diaphragm, and be held until the ribs are slowly inflated,\nballoon fashion, when it should be exhaled through the open mouth,\ngently and without effort until the ribs contract Never push the ribs\nto lengthen the expiration of breath A good plan to insure easy and quiet breathing is to count slowly to\nten while the chest box is being inflated, and also when the air is\nbeing exhaled In this manner the breath will be prevented from\n\n\ncoming and going in spasmodic gasps and jerks The number ten may\nbe increased gradually to twenty or thirty, until the student is able to\nproduce breath sufficient for the phrase vocalized Regular breathing\nexercises should be taken every day before singing, the hands being\nplaced upon the ribs, in order to feel and insure their gradual rise and\nfall An anatomical study of the throat, windpipe, and lungs should be\nmade (Fig 2), and this will considerably help the student to\nunderstand the difficult mechanism of voice production Fig 2 —Throat, windpipe, and lungs Practice gradually adds new notes to the voice, but the young singer\nmust be careful not to strain the vocal organs by endeavoring to sing\nhigh and low notes before they are naturally developed Concones and every variety of singing exercises should be practiced\nbefore a song is undertaken Over-practice is harmful Vocal organs\nshould never be fatigued or unduly taxed, and half-an-hour’s practice\nis ample—indeed, more valuable than an hour at a stretch Singing directly after meals should be avoided, and the throat must\nnot be coddled in furs or compressed by high collars Dainty Modern Songs\nIn drawing-room singing, four or five-versed lyrics are not nearly so\ncharming as the dainty modern songs of two or three verses, and these\nmust never be undertaken until the student has reached a proper\nunderstanding of phrasing, breathing, and expression Many singers prefer to accompany themselves, but this has its\ndisadvantages, as the voice is far better produced when the vocalist is\nstanding The position should be easy and natural, the head erect, but\nnot lifted back, as this contracts and narrows the larynx While the singer should enter into the idea of the composer, she\nshould have her own conception of the song, and endeavor to give it,\nas far as possible, her own individual expression, her voice being\ncolored by the cultivation of her soul; otherwise the most perfect\nvocalization will fail to move the audience These elementary rules hold good for the male as well as the female\nsinger, and cannot be too carefully considered A further important factor in the art of singing is the hygiene of the\nhuman body The singer must cherish physical health Plenty of\noutdoor exercise should be taken Indulgence in drinking and over-\neating is injurious To practice when fatigued, or indisposed, is to risk\npermanent harm to the voice; and to sing when suffering from a cold\nis extremely foolish At such times, breathing exercises may be taken\nwith advantage, as they clear the lungs and help towards recovery Lady singers are sometimes inclined to wear gowns which do not\n\n\nallow them sufficient room for breathing purposes, and they will often\nwillfully sacrifice the well-being of their voices to be fashionably\nattired In order to perform their functions properly, the lungs and\nribs must have space and freedom from pressure Too narrow bodices\nare almost as pernicious to the voice as tight lacing, for these\nseriously retard the breathing, and what in loose garments is natural\nand easy of accomplishment, becomes an obvious struggle, which\nfatigues the singer and renders her voice thin and poor in quality This\nis often the reason why a vocalist is seen to lift her shoulders and pant\naudibly during her song, thus marring her conception, which may be,\nin every other particular, delightful and artistic Many singers with weak lungs find voice production extremely\nbeneficial, for proper breathing and careful practice do more to\nstrengthen a delicate chest than any bottled remedies The vocalist should never stoop (for this narrows and compresses\nthe vocal organs), and in singing the first care should be to see that\nthe shoulders are well thrown back, although not strained to an\nunnatural position In practicing, it is beneficial to keep the arms folded behind the\nback, placing the hands over the elbows, and taking care not to thrust\nthe head forward This will keep the chest expanded, and the body\neasily upright The Value of a Good Accompanist\nWhen performing, it is necessary to be equipped with a good\naccompanist—one who understands the art thoroughly, and refrains\nfrom banging out the notes as if the voice of the singer were merely\nthe background to his own performance The three qualities essential\nin an accompanist are sympathy, artistic sensibility, and discernment\nto understand the temperament and conception of the vocalist An inefficient accompanist has power to transform an artist’s\nhighest and most conscientious endeavor into irritability and inability\nto render individual expression Pianists frequently are highly\nrecommended to singers because of their gift of sight reading Now\nthis is a very valuable and important accessory, but there are many\nexcellent sight readers who have no idea of that delicate and tactful\nmanipulation of accompaniment found in the true artist, and who,\neven though they play correctly the most difficult music placed before\n\n\nthem, sadly fail because of inadequate comprehension of the needs\nvital to the singer To hustle the singer is almost as heinous a fault as to lag behind Some accompanists convey the fatiguing impression of a brake\napplied to a carriage wheel, and the artist feels as if she were pulling\nthe pianist through the song, while others play as if they were racing\nto catch a train, and there is not a moment to lose Both these defects\nare equally fatal The pianist on these occasions should neither be\nindependent nor dependent She or he must realize that, although the\npianoforte is subordinate, it is extremely important because of its\npower to influence the mind and conception of the singer, who should\nfeel an electric tide of sympathy and support flowing from the\npianoforte and carrying the voice on a wave of sound An accompanist should be chosen with care, rehearsed with\nfrequently, and must possess individual qualities in common with the\ntemperament of the singer A sense of reliability and strength\nconveyed will do much to put the most nervous vocalist at ease, and\ngive that tranquility and self-possession without which no singing is\nsuccessful Rehearsing before a mirror is of great assistance, for it is only in\nstudying the reflection of one’s features when singing that one is able\nto check nervous mannerisms and facial contortions Pains must be\ntaken to open the lips adequately wide, for the mouth is the mold; the\nvoice, the molten gold; and, if the mold is twisted or narrowed, the\ngold will be warped and flawed in quality The simpler the manner of the singer the sweeter the song, for the\naffectation sometimes indulged in, the airs and grimaces commonly\nknown as “side,” which some singers see fit to employ, are as\nunsightly as a mud-splashed window-pane They are often also the\ninsignia of the incompetent and the ignorant, for it is never the true\nartist who thus obtrudes herself on her hearers Of course, in some cases apparent affectation really originates in\nextreme nervousness and hyper self-consciousness In such cases the\nsinger must battle patiently with this embarrassing trait until it is\novercome, for unless this is accomplished one’s singing can never be a\njoy and delight In order to be successful, a song must be delivered harmoniously; to\nvoice sweet exquisite words accompanied by facial contortions is to\nmake a pitiful caricature of your performance Take care, therefore, that your attitude, features, and expression\n\n\ncombine to carry the emotion conveyed in your voice Study unity\nand repose Endeavor to forget your own identity for the time being,\nconsidering yourself only as the cage that holds the nightingale Although the singer should be perfect mistress of the songs forming\nher repertoire, she should always deliver them freshly and\nspontaneously There is an old saying, “Familiarity breeds contempt,” and,\nnotwithstanding the fact that this is usually said of individuals, it may\nbe applied very truly to the relationship that exists between singer\nand song Why Singers Often Fail\nIt is very usual for an ambitious student to be consumed with\nconscientious determination She makes up her mind to learn a\ndifficult song, and she works assiduously at it day after day, week\nafter week, until she knows every word and every note By-and-by she performs it proudly to a select circle of friends, and\nshe is surprised and discouraged to find that all her keen enthusiasm\nfor the song has gone It does not seem to suit her voice; the words\nhave lost meaning The emotion she at first poured into it has\ndisappeared, and she is thoroughly disheartened, and is quite unable\nto find reason or remedy for her indifference An experienced artist would be able to show that student in a\nmoment wherein her failure lay She had allowed herself to become too familiar, and familiarity had\nbred contempt The song doubtless needed practice, but not incessant\ngrinding and toiling One cannot hammer the arts into one’s head as if\nthey were nails being driven into wood The subtle essence, the\nephemeral spirit of the song will still evade the singer To catch that,\nand to reveal it to others, the work must be as pure as the widespread\npetals of a flower So, when listlessness replaces your high enthusiasm for a song with\nwhich you have become too familiar, do not be disheartened, but put\nit away, and determine not to touch it or hear it sung until your first\neagerness to master it is reborn Then, and then only, take it out and\nsing it, and you will be astonished at the result; for having mastered\nthe technicalities you are able to pour your heart into your words, and\n\n\nthe result amazes you and delights your hearers, who think you have\nnever sung anything better or more suitable to the pitch and timbre of\nyour voice

    "—Correct position for reciter Fig 1a —The stiff, unnatural position It is frequently and quite erroneously supposed by the uninitiated\nthat, given a good memory and a pleasing voice, the young would-be\nelocutionist may become highly successful in the art of reciting It is\nonly the painstaking, experienced artist who realizes that these\nattributes are but as the husk to the nut, the calyx to the bud Cased in its shell is the kernel, and folded in its green sheath are the\npetals of the flower So, likewise, the voice and power of memorizing\nmust be but the covering of numerous other qualities, attained only\nby perseverance, judicious practice, and that artistic sense of fitness\nwithout which all attempts to excel are in vain It is impossible to play a symphony on the pianoforte before\ngrinding away at the rudiments of music, and no one may build a\nhouse without mastering the elements of architecture Yet the difficult\nart of reciting is often approached by a novice, who, having pounded\nsome poem or prose into his or her memory (reciting is usually a\nfeminine qualification) plunges into it with all the self-satisfaction of\nignorance, and pains or fatigues her listeners by her flagrant and\nunsympathetic rendering of a masterpiece, which, in experienced\nhands, would be an exquisite piece of work, something to be\nremembered and dwelt upon with considerable pleasure The speaking voice, properly treated, is an instrument of exquisite\nmusic, capable of as many shades of feeling and power as the pipe\norgan Before all else the voice must possess sympathy, sweetness,\npower of expression, and naturalness; and, unless these qualities are\ngoverned by a high sensibility, keen intuition, and common sense,\nthey are futile The wing of the voice is the breath Unless this is elastic, easily and\n\n\nnaturally produced, the voice is like a crippled bird, or similar to a\nmusical instrument with broken strings Thus the cultivation of voice\nand breath is the most powerful adjunct to good reciting, and this\nonly comes by constant practice In practicing, the reciter should stand in an easy attitude (Fig 1)—\nerect, but not stiffly upright, and with muscles neither tense nor\nunduly lax, as in Fig 1a “There are no straight lines in Nature ” This\nis an invaluable motto for the student The best method of gaining a\nclear and flexible voice is to read aloud some paragraph or verse\nsoftly at first, studying the meaning and sound of every word spoken,\nand endeavoring to express its phonetic quality, not only with the lip,\nbut with the eyes A mirror is an excellent help (Fig 2) It will show\nthe beginner the difference between facial expression and facial\ncontortion (Fig 2a) Fig 2 —Facial expression Fig 2a —Facial contortion The Speaking Register\nThe paragraph may be repeated in a gradual crescendo until the full\npower of the voice is used, always taking care to avoid harsh and\nstridulous tones, and not strain or fatigue the throat When the\nstudent has accomplished this to her satisfaction, she should allow her\nvoice to die gradually away, until it is almost a whisper, but her tone\nmust always be clear and round in quality This method will bring\nmany different shades of inflection and feeling into the voice, and she\nwill be astonished at the notes she will add to her speaking register A good exercise is to make out a list of abstract words, and,\nconcentrating attention upon them, endeavor to convey their full\nmeaning with the aid of the mirror Such sentences as: “I love you\ndearly,” “My hate is too deep for words,” “My scorn is intense,” “My\ntender concern,” “My pity,” “My contempt,” “My indifference,” “My\ndesire,” “My despair,” and other impromptu phrases may be spoken in\n\n\ndifferent tones, united, with eye and features, to express the qualities\nvoiced The student need not despair because she has a bad or untrained\nmemory The power of memorizing verse or prose only requires\ndiligence \nand \nconcentration \nto \nbecome \nfacile \nand \nnatural Exaggeration, affectation, melodrama, and meaningless gesture should\nbe avoided, for there is nothing so appealing as simplicity Before reading a poem aloud, the reciter should master the meaning\nof the story it sets forward She must remember that she is about to\npaint a picture in words To do this effectively, she must avoid\ndaubing in lurid colors She will find it helpful to regard her mind as\nher palette, her voice as her brush, and her color tones as sympathy,\ntranquillity, gentleness, optimism, faithfulness, and clearness of\nexpression She should take as much pains when practicing as when\nperforming before others, endeavoring to criticise her mode of speech\nand expression just as though she were listening to some one else’s\nrecital The following simple rules will prove of great\nassistance:—\n 1 Breathe easily, inflating the lungs slowly, and without effort\nor sound 2 Speak distinctly and clearly, and avoid shouting 3 Sound the consonants, but do not hiss them 4",
    "4 Sound the syllables distinctly, but without undue emphasis Sound the syllables distinctly, but without undue emphasis 5 Sound the definite article without giving it too much\nimportance 6 Read brightly and naturally 7 Avoid monotony: graduate tones by feeling 8 Understand clearly and sympathetically what is studied 9 Read with earnestness, but without heaviness 10 Mind pauses and emphasis Here is an example from “David Copperfield”:\n“Here is our pew in the church What a high-backed pew With a\nwindow near it, out of which our house can be seen, and is seen many\ntimes during the morning’s service by Peggotty, who likes to make\nherself as sure as she can that it’s not being robbed, or is not in\nflames But, though Peggotty’s eye wanders, she is much offended if\nmine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to\nlook at the clergyman ”\n\n\nIn this passage the reciter is for the time being a little boy\nendeavoring to sit quietly in church and fix his eyes on the clergyman She must be simplicity itself in order to depict the David and his\nsurroundings, lending a sympathetic eye that probes the brain and\nheart of the child squeezed between his mother and nurse, and she\nmust see every detail as he describes it In order to do this successfully, intuition is essential It will inspire\nthe voice to a like comprehension, with the result that her listeners\nwill be able to see that little weary figure quite plainly Thus, in\neverything undertaken, the student must learn to merge her\npersonality into that of the man, woman, or child of whom she is\nspeaking, so that the words spoken seem indeed to fall from the lips of\nthe characters portrayed Appropriate Gesture\nAppropriate gesture presents difficulties, and, although occasionally\na powerful aid, it is more often a stumbling-block to the inexperienced\nreciter Many otherwise excellent recitals have been marred by\nsuperfluous demonstrations, which remind one forcibly of the action\nsongs and recitations performed in a kindergarten, whilst not a few\nreciters hedge themselves in with boundaries They will mention the\nsea, and point to a horizon, indicate distant hills, wood and lake,\nfrequently forgetting their respective situations I have seen upon\nmore than one occasion a reciter engaged in a ludicrous juggling of\nher scenery, pushing the sea aside to make room for the hills, and\nmerging her forests in the lake This forgetfulness, usually engendered\nby extreme nervousness, renders an artist ridiculous How much\nbetter, then, to refrain from gesticulation, unless she has mastered its\nintricacies In drawing-room reciting the voice must expand according to the\nacoustic properties of the apartment A good way of making the voice\ncarry is to imagine it an india-rubber ball, which is being thrown\nagainst the opposite wall This thought will gradually insure its elastic\nproperties When reciting, the eyes should be kept from roving among the\naudience, nor should they be fixed in a strained, glassy stare on the\nceiling, for they are too useful to the performer, and will be needed to\nexpress different shades of thought If the reciter is nervous, she should endeavor not to show it by\ntwisting her fingers or moving her feet The best cure for this\nharassing affliction is to glance quietly at the audience before\nbeginning to recite Taken individually, they will be found far from\nalarming After this, a determined endeavor should be made to\nconcentrate the mind on the artistic rendering of the recital Fig 3 —The epic radius, or mental zone To many elocutionists, costumes are a help, enabling them to grip\nmore powerfully the character portrayed In this case a certain\namount of gesture is advisable, but there are no hard and fast rules Actions must be governed by discretion and common sense The hand may properly be called a second tongue As such it should\nbe treated, and, to continue the simile, should not be allowed to\nstammer behind or chatter meaninglessly before the reciter The hands and arms are capable of a vast amount of expression\nwhen properly used Gesture may be divided into three\nclasses:—\n1 The epic radius, or mental zone, is the movement above the head\nand horizontal with the shoulder (Fig 3) These are sweeping and\ngraceful, not jerky movements, indicating such sentiments as honor,\nconscience, awe, veneration, &c , and may be used with advantage in\nsuch lines\nas—\n“Great ocean strongest of Creation’s sons,\nUnconquerable, unreposed, untired,\nThat roll’d the wild, profound eternal bass\nIn Nature’s anthem, and made music such\nAs pleased the ear of God original,\nUnmarr’d, unfaded work of Deity From age to age enduring and unchanged,\nMajestical inimitable vast Uttering loud satire day and night on each\nSucceeding race, and little pompous work\nOf man —unfallen, religious, holy sea ”\n\n\nIn Shakespearean recitals and other blank verse, this epic zone may\nbe used, as, for instance, in such pieces as the choruses of Henry V Fig 4 —Rhetorical radius or moral zone 2",
    "2 The rhetorical radius, or moral zone, includes the movements of\nthe arm from breast to shoulder and from the region of the heart (Fig 4), and may be used to appeal, implore, beseech, express love, hate,\nfear, contempt, &c , as in Queen Katherine’s speech in Shakespeare’s\n“King Henry VIII ,” Act ii Scene\n4:—\n“Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,\nAnd to bestow your pity on me ”\n3 The colloquial radius, or vital zone, from below the waist (Fig 5), is used to express ordinary sentiments that do not emanate in the\nheart or higher intellect, and may be used to give point to a simple,\neveryday occurrence, or narration, as\nin—\n“Only a pin, yet it calmly lay\nOn the tufted floor in the light of day;\nAnd it shone serenely fair and bright,\nReflecting back the noonday light ”\nDuring the long winter evenings, when amusements and\nentertainments are cordially welcomed in home circles and at friends’\nfiresides, the youth or maiden who is unable to play or sing, may,\nwith a little care and practice, provide a delightful item in the\nprogramme, which will add considerably to the evening’s enjoyment Fig 5 —Colloquial radius or vital zone An hour’s regular practice a day will work wonders with the voice\nof these aspirants, and there are many simple and exquisite poems\nthat are easily committed to memory, for the student is far more likely\nto succeed and give pleasure to others in memorizing at first only the\n\n\nsimplest and shortest poems, remembering always Shakespeare’s\ninvaluable counsel to\nplayers:—\n“Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly\non the tongue; but, if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had\nas lief the town-crier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air too much\nwith your hand—thus; but use all gently; for in the very torrent,\ntempest, and (as I may say) the whirlwind of passion, you must\nacquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness Be not\ntoo tame, neither, but let your discretion be your tutor; suit the action\nto the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that\nyou o’erstep not the modesty of Nature ”\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\nTHE ART OF WHISTLING\nMethods of a Famous Siffleur\nThere is no form of drawing-room entertainment which, when well\ndone, \nis \nmore \ninteresting \nthan \nwhistling, \nwith \npianoforte\naccompaniment Below are embodied the views and methods of Mr Charles Capper,\nthe famous English siffleur, regarding this unique and attractive\nmeans of entertainment The great part of humanity knows nothing of that ability of piping\nand whistling so natural and melodious in the blackbird and thrush Most of us have at some time or other put by a little of our bread-and-\nbutter earnings in order to take a few lessons in learning to sing or to\nplay the pianoforte or some stringed instrument But there are\ncomparatively few who turn to whistling as a means of livelihood or\nas an accomplishment It is fortunate that this is the case, for, unless\none possesses considerable natural talent, it is mere waste of money,\ntime, and endeavor Whistling cannot be hammered into being It is only where real\nability is possessed that the student may set himself to work and\novercome its many difficulties, and hope to achieve his best Another gift equally essential is that of a good natural ear—an ear\nthat instantly distinguishes and corrects the note which is a shade\nflatter or sharper than it should be It is a fact worthy of note that, while an unusually high roof to the\nmouth is a disadvantage to the singer, it is—so some medical\nspecialists assert—a great gain to the whistler, and perhaps this is the\nreason why it is so rare to meet skilled exponents of the art However, it is common enough to hear in almost every grade of life\nthe whistling that has never been cultivated For example, in the early\nmorning, a few shrill tuneless notes float up to one’s bedchamber from\nthe area steps, as a dairyman hands in the allowance of milk; but this\nannoys rather than delights, although it speaks eloquently of the\nhuman soul of the whistler When the boy whistles, his mother knows he is well—in a good\ntemper, and contented with the whole universe The merchant,\nstepping into his office, may trill a few bars of “Tommy, make room\nfor your uncle,” and the sound conveys volumes to the sharp-eared\nclerks, who foresee a day of unusual calm and peace; because a man\nsuffering from spleen, liver, gout, or toothache never so far forgets his\nagony as to whistle Whistling invariably shows a light heart, and perhaps the reason\nwhy the birds indulge in this pastime so freely is because they know\nnothing of the burdens that beset mankind Breathing and Tone\nThe most important qualities to be observed in whistling are\nproduction and control of breathing, modulation, purity and\nroundness of tone The method of breathing in whistling is exactly similar to that used\nin vocalization, and can be taught by any good teacher of singing Scales and exercises should be daily practiced with infinite care,—to\nkeep the notes clear and of even pitch Slurring or stumbling in a quick passage can be easily perceived—\nperhaps more so in the whistler than in the singer Scales and runs\nshould be undertaken, slowly at first, gradually increasing speed and\ntone until perfect flexibility is attained Many a whistler capable of faultless execution fails to charm,\nthrough monotony of tone This is a fault as common as it is serious Whistling, with practice and thought, can be modulated in a far\ngreater degree than either the flute or the piccolo, and with much\ngreater effect It is not enough to whistle a song correctly The student should first\nstudy and memorize the words, so that he may express the tender\npathos expressed in the song The whistler should pay as much attention to artistic rendition as\nthe vocalist—if possible, even more—because he cannot voice the\nwords with which to appeal to the hearts of his hearers He is obliged\nto convey the sorrow, or humor, as the case may be, without the\nutterances we recognize as the insignia of distress, joy, or love; and\nhis heart must be behind his notes, and enter into them, to win the\nspirits of the audience to comprehension and sympathy Suitable Solos\nWhistling may be divided into two\nclasses:—\n(1) The florid —necessary in such solos as Arditi’s “Il Bacio,” which\nseems at first to the beginner to teem with insurmountable difficulties,\nbut which a little earnest practice will soon overcome (2) The sentimental —In this category are Bishop’s early English\nsongs, such as “Bid me discourse,” “Tell me, my heart,” “Should he\nupbraid,” “Lo, hear the gentle lark,” “Love has eyes,” Clay’s “I’ll sing\nthee songs of Araby,” &c All these songs make excellent whistling\nsolos, and are delightful when rendered with artistic sympathy and\nmeaning All songs must be memorized The whistler cannot give necessary\ncontrol to his breathing and production if he holds the music in his\nhand In practicing, it should be placed on a music-stand, and, in\nperforming, must be note perfect His whistling must be so faultless in\nits conception that the audience must almost hear the words coming\nfrom his lips Most of the solos forming the whistler’s repertoire are well known\nand popular, and the verses of such songs as “My mother bids me bind\nmy hair” are familiar wherever the English language is spoken, so that\nall audiences are capable of interpreting the meaning of the sweet\nlilting notes When we listen to “The Lost Chord,” played on the\norgan, we seem to hear the throbbing rhythm of the words just as if\nsome spirit were singing them, and so it should be in the whistling of\nSpohr’s “Rose softly blooming,” and many another song which will\ndoubtless occur to the student Care should be taken not to whistle in too high a key, as this spoils\nthe quality of the tone, rendering it thin and shrill The middle\nregister contains better notes than the higher The piccolo is pitched one octave higher than the flute, whilst the\nwhistler’s notes are said to be two octaves above the flute Although\nthe notes whistled are apparently very high, when judged by the ear,\nor compared with the pianoforte accompaniment, they are not so, in\nreality It is rare to find the extremely high or the extremely low whistler Except in a very few cases, all whistle in about the same pitch The\nmost usual key is F or G",
    "The\nmost usual key is F or G In spite of the old dogmatic assertion about the “whistling woman\nand the crowing hen,” there are more young lady performers in this\nprofession than young men, and very charming whistlers some of\nthem are It is a remarkable fact that not infrequently an individual, whose\ntonation is faultless in singing, cannot whistle such a simple melody\nas the national anthem without coming to grief Here are two useful points always observed by Mr Capper The first is never to laugh when performing The veriest novice\nknows that his risibilities must be well under control before he can\nwhistle a single note, so that it is essential for him—no matter what\nfunny incident is noticed and appeals to him—to hold tight to his\ngravity The second is that lip-salves should be strictly avoided, as they\nrender the lips susceptible to cracks and cold; besides, they make a\nfilm which sticks and prevents clear whistling The second is that lip-salves should be strictly avoided, as they\nrender the lips susceptible to cracks and cold; besides, they make a\nfilm which sticks and prevents clear whistling CHAPTER XVIII\nBUNKUM ENTERTAINMENTS\nThe Cuckoo of Society\nIt has been asserted that the noun “bunkum” is first cousin to the\nverb “to bunk ” If so, the dealer in bunkumisms disdains the\nconnection until matters grow too hot for him at the end of a\nperformance, when, as a last resource, he hugs his relative gladly Cupboard affection this, and in order to shelter himself from the\nrighteous wrath of the audience, achieves a flying bunk from the\nplatform The word “bunkum” is interesting It is defined in the dictionary as\n“speech spoken merely to please one’s supporters or constituents and\nsecure their votes—mere talk ” It originates from “Buncombe, a\ndistrict in North Carolina, with a constituency, to please whom a\nmember of theirs once boasted he made a speech in Congress ”\nBunkum covers a wider field than science, woman’s suffrage, or\npolitics It is an autocrat that stands aloof, and demands the gentle\nhearts of greenhorn and sage alike for its sacrificial fires It endeavors\nto prove that the age of miracles has not been choked out of existence\nbeneath the widespread fingers of civilization, or how could an\norange be transformed before our eyes into a cauliflower, an egg into\na peeled potato The bunkum entertainer molds the brains of the most iron-headed\ncynic into putty, and transforms the scoffing jeers of the know-all\nschoolboy into humble admiration He is a quack sorcerer, and, even\nwhile we designate him as such, we are obliged to own that his art is\nsteeped in deepest mystery The bunkum entertainer is a parasite, a cartoonist, and mimic, a\nsmooth-tongued, \nunscrupulous \nrascal, \nwho \ndeserves—the\nconscientious entertainer (who never tries bunkum because he is too\nstupid and wool-headed) so has it—to be banished to a desert island\nand served to cannibals as minced donkey flesh “à la bunkum ” He is\nthe sort of man who borrows five pound notes, gold watches, and\ndiamond rings from his audience, and forgets to return them He\ncheats, deludes, patters, lies by the yard, swallows enough solid\n\n\nmaterials to furnish a warehouse, and give an ostrich indigestion He is tough and brazen, and cheaply cynical at the expense of the\nauthentic conjurer, juggler, phrenologist, ventriloquist, seer, and\nspiritualist He is the cuckoo of society He concocts a potpourri of\nbrains and wit, and offers it as his own; and yet, in spite of it all, how\nfascinating and overwhelming is his personality He is the fool of the\nworld—the jester who prances about in cap and bells, who causes our\nsides to ache in our futile effort to keep our risibilities decorously\npitched Never did a folly play pitch and toss with the pedantic\nphrases of solemn courtiers, kings and prelates, as ably and\nirreverently as this monster incarnate with the five senses of mankind He is wrapped in mystery We regard him with awe and wonder:\nthe curtains, the table, the walls, the footlights are his faithful agents We gaze at the rabbit popping up from his hat, the watch flicked\nthrough a pistol barrel to the wall, the inane jack of diamonds darting\nfrom his mouth to the back of his coat, in trembling amazement of his\ncunning We whisper to our beating hearts, “Can such things be ” At\nthat instant he throws aside the cloak of secrecy, and shows us his\nglaring infidelity He has not, as we supposed, ruptured and mastered\nevery law of gravitation and nature He has simply been dealing in the\nart of “bunkum,” and, when he reveals his methods to us, as he never\nfails to do in a continuous prattle of artless confidence, we see—or we\nthink we see—that it is all child’s play and foolish absurdity The rabbit has not been suddenly created, full-grown, in the crown\nof his immaculate silk hat It owes its mild behavior to constant\ndiscipline, its sleek coat to cabbage leaves Like Topsy—like all other\nbipeds, quadrupeds and aquatic creatures—it has simply “growed ” Its\ncage is behind the stage, to which it will presently be spirited away, to\nrest in peace after its labors When we discover this we become very wide-awake, very “cute ”\nWe will see through the next trick or perish in the attempt Alas alas for our righteous determination; once again we are deluded and\nsnared The table performs a giddy reel, the watch of the confiding\nbenign bald-headed gentleman in the corner is shattered before our\neyes, and with a thrill of horror we strain our necks to gaze in his\ndirection in order to witness the anticipated apoplectic seizure The gentleman, however, remains stolidly non-committal My\nyoung schoolboy eyes observe a whitening of the gills, a compression\nof the lower jaw that bodes ill for the entertainer if he does not make\n\n\ngood the loss; and a few minutes after he is bidden of the smiling\nperformer to look in his pocket, and, lo and behold the\nmonogrammed watch, which we are ready to swear we saw him pass\nto the platform, dangles safely from the end of the chain spanning his\nstomach The shattered timepiece, we are told glibly, was only a base\nimitation in tin and glass But how, where, in what manner queries my boyish soul, steeped\nin perplexity; and, by-and-by, the monster answers all these questions\nas if he read that inner inquisitive voice so satisfactorily that I go\nhome and try the trick before an admiring circle of friends, borrowing\nmy maiden aunt’s watch for the purpose, she being quite unaware\nthat I have its threepenny duplicate in my pocket Sure of Success\nI am sure of success I imitate the performer’s patronizing\ncomplacency perfectly I smile and sneer politely with all his evil\nsuavity, and then I fire my pistol, shatter the glass of the threepenny,\nand my aunt rises from her chair with a piercing shriek “Tom, you little wretch, what have you done ”\nWith an airy smile I bid her be calm, and from the rear part of my\nperson produce with a deft movement her precious belonging “Your watch, madam,” I say, with all the superior pleasantry of the\n“bunkum” performer Then the smile freezes on my face, the timepiece feels strangely\nlight in my clammy hand I gaze at it in horror My eyeballs distend,\nmy heart swings backwards and forwards between my ribs I have\nbungled The good watch is shattered beyond hope of redemption The disc of paper and glass cowers up at me, its hands stretched\nconfusedly across its impudent face Disgrace and ignominy descend swiftly upon me My maiden aunt\nprepares to leave the house, declaring she will never enter it again My parents, who expect great things at her demise, beseech her\nforgiveness in vain I am banished from the firelit circle to my own\nroom, up to which a step presently approaches, striding away from\nthe disorder and hysterics downstairs My father enters with a long\nslender implement behind his back—an implement which, from\nformer experience, I know portends woe terrific I draw the curtain—I am chastised and broken in body and spirit For a whole week I keep severely aloof from the awful bunkum tyrant,\nand then, alas I am drawn again to the hall, where he is performing\nas remorselessly as the silly fly is drawn to enmesh himself in the\nspider’s web The next time I played a trick on my family I took good care it\nshould be of a kind that would do no one—not even the most\nhypersensitive individual—any harm Needless to say, my aunt was\nnot of the circle Thought-Reading Extraordinary\nI told them briefly and airily that I was now about to exhibit my\nwonderful skill in thought-reading Perhaps I should add that my\nsister Jane, who adores me, was chosen as my confederate Bidding\nthem fix on a number, which I would at once discover by the simple\nmeans of placing my fingers on their temples, I withdrew with a bland\nsmile into the passage When I returned they giggled a little, and one twelve-year-old cynic\nof the opposite sex piped out\nscornfully—\n“You’ll never guess it, Tom You can’t possibly—so there ”\nThis maiden, often a thorn in my flesh, I silenced with a severe\nfrown “If you please, I must request the audience to be perfectly silent, to\nconcentrate their minds—those of you who possess them——” I\npaused to scowl at my pink-and-white torment—“concentrate them\nabsolutely on the chosen number I am not going to guess it I am\ngoing to discover it by means of thought transference, and, as the\nstrain is very great, I must ask you to be perfectly silent ”\n“It’s like having our photo taken,” whispered the torment, but some\none bumped her ribs, and she was reluctantly silent Solemnly, slowly, I moved round the circle With drawn brows and\nnarrowed eyes I placed my fingers lightly on the temples of my father,\nmother, uncle, and friends in succession, and then I reached Jane She\nset her teeth just as I had shown her, and I felt the muscles at her\ntemples work steadily Having counted ten vibrations, I went on\nstolidly to the other heads until the circle was completed Then,\nstanding before them, I wiped the imaginary sweat of fatigue from my\n\n\nbrow The torment looked radiant “You don’t know it There—I said so, Tom, you goose ”\n“Madam,” I returned with a bow, “the digit fixed upon was ten ”\nTableau vivant The complete confusion of the torment, the most\nguileless “bravo” from Jane, and my uncle’s audible whisper to my\nproud parents “The boy’s a positive genius ”\n“And he looks quite white and tired,” quoth mamma Result—the promise of a ripping new bicycle from grandpa as a\nreward for my merit I owed a lot to Jane, who remained my faithful unsuspected\nconfederate in many other tricks, which gained me a reputation of\nbeing something of an extraordinary phenomenon and possessed of\nembryo genius It was delightful to enjoy the giddy pinnacle of fame\nto which my female relations raised me Another trick that caused much sensation was the following, and,\nfor any youth who wishes to follow in the footsteps of the great\n(which I think some old poet chap—who had never studied the art of\nbunkum—remarked are written “on the sands of Time,”) I will state\nclearly the manner in which it was done Place three corks on the table, and tell your wondering home circle\nthat, while you

and a\nquick change into my mother’s old dress, renovated by Jane,\ntransforms him from an awkward-limbed hoyden to a demure old\nlady This dressing need not cost the performer anything He has only to\nunearth a linen bag, containing remnants and articles of outgrown\nclothing, to work the miracle A dummy should have as many\ndifferent costumes as Queen Elizabeth They will all come in handy,\nand add novelty to the entertainment If the cost of procuring a dummy is beyond the performer’s purse—\nas it was beyond mine for quite a considerable time—he may engage a\nconfederate to walk, behave, and talk automatically, conceal his face\nin mask and wig, and render a clever and ludicrous performance This, however, needs considerable rehearsing and care The Three Old Maids\nAn item that makes for novelty and change in an evening’s\nperformance is the\nfollowing:—\nSecure three young girls—I don’t mean kidnap them, but use your\nmasculine powers of persuasion (I find the majority of women folk\nneed little when it’s a matter of dressing up and showing off to\nhilarious friends ) This is a digression Each damsel must have an old woman’s mask, the uglier the better,\nsecured at the back of her head by means of elastics, which are easily\nhidden by her hair She must wear a long skirt that conceals her feet,\nthe back part of it covered by a small apron Her hands, in mittens, should be clasped behind her over a stick To\nhide the edge of the mask, some fluffy headgear is essential, such as a\nlace fascinator with a rose or two fixed at the side, which is folded\ncrosswise over the back of her shoulders and frames the mask Fig 2 —The Three Old Maids of Lee Place the three behind a curtain When all is ready—and the\nperformers should take care to stand perfectly still, for fear of\ndisclosing the masked profiles at the back of their heads—the curtain\nis drawn, and they sing to a pianoforte accompaniment a verse of “We\nare three young maids of Lee ”\nThe onlookers will probably designate this “pretty, but rather\ntame ” This is where the fun comes in, for no one is prepared for the\ngrand finale At the end of the verse the maidens step backwards in a\nrow and retire behind the curtain, or turn round with their masks to\nthe audience, their heads thrown well over the hands holding the\nsticks (Fig 2) When they are ready the curtain is again drawn, and,\namid shrieks of merriment, the last verse is sung by voices as cracked,\ndiscordant, and out of tune as possible—“We are three old maids of\nLee ” The hands and heads should quiver with old age, the figures be\nbowed over the sticks The result is ludicrous to a degree, and never\nfails to delight the unprepared audience I once saw an old dowager duchess, severe in full consciousness of\nwar-paint and feathers, nearly burst the diamond snap of her necklace\nwith laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle presented",
    "I once saw an old dowager duchess, severe in full consciousness of\nwar-paint and feathers, nearly burst the diamond snap of her necklace\nwith laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle presented Its great\nadvantage is that it is cheap and easy, and can be performed without\nany rehearsing, by inviting three girls from the audience and spending\na few minutes in instructions behind the scenes If you do not know them well enough to presume so far upon their\ngood-nature, call up three chums of your own sex, array them in\nfeminine apparel, and the result is even more ludicrous, if more\nexpensive, for in this case you will require wigs to hide their cropped\nheads for the first verse, and dressing them will need more time Bunkum Lectures\nI have frequently amused my long-suffering friends and relatives by\nBunkum Lectures For example, one on Toe and Cornology, quite an\noriginal science, gives scope for the most idiotic remarks on the\ncharacteristic traits portrayed by toes For my lecture I have an easel, covered with a block of thin paper\nperforated at the top, so that the sheets are easily torn off On these I\nrapidly sketch in turn different types of toes in chalk If the entertainer is unable to draw, he can probably persuade an\nartist friend to sketch the members required beforehand In this case\nthe sheets need not be perforated, but simply thrown over the top of\nthe easel as he exhibits the different drawings An easel is soon\nconstructed, and can be made at home out of soap boxes by the\namateur carpenter; or the block of paper may be placed on a music-\nstand I begin my lecture by a short treatise on toes I show diagrams of\n(1) the President’s toe, (2) the prelate’s toe, (3) the courtier’s toe, (4)\nthe tyrant’s toe, (5) the toady’s toe, (6) the artisan’s toe, (7) the\nneurotic toe, (8) the spiteful toe, (9) the cringing toe, (10) the poetic\ntoe, (11) the melancholy toe, (12) the absurd toe, (13) the\nphilanthropic toe, (14) the corn-riddled toe Here I try to be witty,\nand remark that some people of an original turn of mind wear their\ncorns on their noses instead of inside their boots “The corn is precious—we all need corn; we make a great to-do\nwhen our corn is oppressed by taxes, for we cherish it There is\nnothing—not even his wife or twin babes—so dear to the heart and\n\n\nnecessary to the well-being of man as corn Corn means bread Bread\nis the staff of life The man with corn (a corn) is grateful for the prop\nof the staff, so that to have a corn sprouting on your big toe should be\nno hardship “It is a convenience It is tinned for consumption in your boot, out\nof reach of Tariff Reformers and Free Traders It is your own private\nproperty Sometimes it is trodden on maliciously, but it does not\nvanish on that account There is something obstinate and bull-necked\nabout the corn—the more it is trodden on the more it asserts itself It\nis a hot-house plant It needs a cover of wool, a roof of boot leather Under these conditions it thrives like the baby fed on Mellin’s food “I can’t understand the fuss the unemployed make Why should\nthey, when they have such a treasure hidden in their boots So long\nas a citizen possesses this luxury he is an independent man What does\nhe want with foreign corn Ah, my friends, we have not yet reached\nthe full realization of the tremendous privileges we inherit The corn\nmay not yet be ripe for cutting, but every day, every hour, sees it\nnearer that perfection which rejoices the heart of humanity “See how beneficent nature has become during the last centuries The bootless, prehistoric savage had to plant and reap his corn in the\nbarren fields, while we are provided gratis with an abundant supply\nthat is likely to last some of us a lifetime “There are, of course, some individuals who have barren, cornless\ntoes, although I am glad to say they are in a very small minority I\nhave taken pains to secure a correct census of the corn-sprouts that\nhave appeared during the last year, and I find on an average that only\n5 per cent are ignorant of this blessing “The uses of a corn crop are too numerous to mention Its chief\nfunction is its use as a barometer",
    "Its chief\nfunction is its use as a barometer The man setting out with his wife\nand children to spend a day at the seaside should, before starting on\nthe excursion, consult his booted friend If it admonishes him severely\nhe should not ignore its voice Woe betide him if he does It is less\ndisastrous for him to drown his conscience than shut his heart against\nthe promptings of his corn “Should he do so, and act upon his determination to spend a long\nday on the sands, anticipating a pleasurable bask in the sunshine, dire\ncatastrophe will befall him Rain descends in bucketfuls upon him, his\npatient wife, and wailing progeny They return to town drenched to\nthe skin, and are all laid up with chills, which means a week’s absence\nfrom the office—perhaps dismissal by his employer, if he is a clerk,\n\n\nand a long doctor’s bill at the end of the month; and who is to blame Had the man obeyed the mandates of the faithful vegetable\nprotuberance on his big toe all would have been well “The only individual I am inclined to respect and admire is the man\nwho cultivates and is led by his corn in all the important affairs of\nlife To be without the ripening corn is to miss the greater part of the\nmeaning and poignancy of existence The possession of this treasure\ncauses a man to thread his way gingerly and tactfully through the city\nstreets He never blunders or bungles; he is a sensitive, considerate\nperson, who unconsciously avoids treading upon or coveting the\nabundant crops of others His corn’s influence is more beneficial than\nfreemasonry or foreign missions “To gain the sympathies and interest of a fellow-being when you are\nin trouble and want his financial aid, don’t plunge into your story at\nonce, but approach him gently with the kindly query, ‘Have

sympathies, and don’t\nwaste further time upon him It will be useless He is a cornless\nindividual, therefore heartless ”\nI wind up my discourse with some such remark as\nthis—\n“Ladies and gentlemen, turn away from the pernicious tyrants who\nseek to rob you of your birthright in advertising corn salves and\nplasters They are wolves in sheep’s clothing They are jealous and\nembittered by the barrenness of their toe pastures which, do what\nthey will, yield no corn ”\nThe Sharp( )-Shooter\nAfter this, in order to secure the forgiveness of my hearers for my\nopinions and oratory, both pure bunkum, I bring a trick to their\nnotice, which I work with Hyde, and of which I am rather proud,\nbecause it is quite original and works awfully well, in spite of the fact\nthat it’s as simple as the alphabet For those who would like to try it,\nhere it\nis:—\nHyde, hidden behind me, is armed with a paper bag inflated with\nair Beforehand I place a used bullet on the floor at the spot at which I\n\n\nintend aiming my pistol I employ some patter to remove the growing alarm of my family,\nand the anxiety expressed for themselves, the furniture, and lastly—\nmy own person “Ladies and gentlemen,” I say with self-complacency extreme, “I am\nabout to perform a feat with my hands”—(joke—pause—a flutter of\nlaughter) “Thank you,” I say with a polite bow—“the like of which\nhas never been seen—since the making of the world I will load and\nfire this revolver, and the bullet will not only make no mark, but there\nwill not even be a flash or smoke You will hear the sound of the\nexplosion, and I will show you the bullet discharged “So that you may see that there is no bunkum in this marvelous\nachievement, I will hand you the bullet before I place it in the barrel\nand immediately after I have fired it ” (Here I pass round unused\nbullet I then place it in full view of the audience in the barrel )\nI retire to the curtain immediately in front of Hyde, and take aim\nabove the spot where the spent bullet lies Count aloud “One, two,\nthree ” At three I pretend to pull the trigger, and Hyde brings his\nhand forcibly on the paper bag, which causes my audience to bounce\nin their chairs Then I cross the platform, stoop, pick up the used bullet, hand it\nround for inspection, and retire modestly, overcome with glory The Ghost\nOccasionally I work a ghost in the following way After some patter,\nin which I inform the onlookers that I am about to conjure up the\nshade of some famous character, I extinguish the lights, and\nwithdrawing to a corner of the room, enfold myself in a long black\nmackintosh or coat that shrouds my head and figure completely I strike a match behind the curtain, and, when I have a good spark\nthat will last a few seconds, blow out the flame, and hold the end of\nthe match between my teeth, so that my mouth is lit up (Fig 3) My\nlips are drawn in a fiendish grin, and I strike an attitude, accompanied\nby inhuman moans and drum-beating from Hyde Fig 3 —The Ghost When the spark dies, I hide the black garment behind the curtain,\nand assume the position I occupied before the appearance of the\nghost Hyde switches on the light, and my shivering onlookers have no key\nto the riddle The apparatus employed by the bunkum entertainer and the cost it\nentails depend largely upon his own ingenuity Most of the articles I\nemploy are of my own manufacture My wigs do not hail from a wig-\nmaker’s, but from the lumber room at the top of our house, where\nJane and I shred disused rope, fix it by means of gum or stitches on to\npieces of stiff book-muslin, shaped so as to fit the head If other\ncolors, such as black and red, are required, we resort to aniline dyes,\nand the result is much satisfaction to ourselves CHAPTER XIX\nVENTRILOQUISM IN A MONTH\nA Practical and Comprehensive Guide to the Art of\nValentine Vox\nThere is one form of entertainment which perhaps makes a\nstronger appeal to the average boy and young man than almost any\nother It would not, in a sense, be wrong to say that ventriloquism is,\nand has been for a great number of years, the most envied of all\naccomplishments incidental to the art of the amateur and semi-\nprofessional entertainer True, ventriloquism for many centuries was regarded as an adjunct\nto wizardry, and the exponents of black magic, but the great success\nachieved by the writer of “Valentine Vox,” the central character in\nwhich was endowed with the most wonderful and extraordinary\npowers of voice throwing, brought the subject of ventriloquism at\nonce under general notice, and ever since it has steadily won its way\ninto universal favor, with the result that, at the present time, it easily\neclipses in popularity most other forms of amusement Despite this, however, the misconceptions existing regarding this\nbranch of vocal phonetics are extraordinarily numerous and\nwidespread, due, perhaps, in a measure to the fact that the amount of\nvaluable written instruction on ventriloquism is so small, while the\nnumber of people who have swallowed the fascinating and\nimprobable adventures dealt with in the book just referred to are\ncorrespondingly large To a very considerable extent, then, it is the object of this chapter\nprimarily to dispose of the many existing fallacies concerning\nventriloquism, because by so doing alone is it possible to commence a\nstudy of the subject with the hope of attaining proficiency and\nsuccess The first idea which the would-be ventriloquist has to dismiss from\nhis mind is that, by following out a stated course of exercises, he will\nbe able to “throw” his voice or, in other words, to upset the\nequanimity of peaceable old gentlemen snoring quietly in the furthest\ncorner of the railway carriage—or ruffle the temper of some aged lady\n\n\nby producing facetious remarks concerning her appearance—from a\nlong distance away; not that those who approach this subject have\nany particular desire to be a disturbing influence to other people, but\nit is safe to say that more take up ventriloquism with the idea of\npractical joking than for any other purpose In point of truth, the real art of Valentine Vox does not lend itself\nvery easily to the production of such illusions; even when the\nperformer is capable of producing ventriloquial sound, he will\ndiscover that the “distant” effect depends almost entirely upon his\nsituation at the moment of utterance, and whether or not those\naround him are prepared to give the credence he desires to his efforts In other words, a ventriloquist cannot throw his voice wheresoever he\nwill as if it were sound bottled up only to come out and be heard\nwhen it is some distance away; the best he can hope for is to make\nthat sound so deceptive to the ears of his audience that, to them, it\nseems to come from some one other than the actual speaker It cannot, however, be denied that the stock-in-trade of the clever\nventriloquist is so unusual and superior to that of his fellow-worker in\nany other branch of entertainment, that he is capable of producing the\nmost humorous and arresting situations Moreover, it is a power\nwhich once gained can never be lost, and although a ventriloquist\nmay, from various causes, give up the pursuit of his favorite subject\nfor a period of many years, yet he can pick it up again at the point\nwhere he left it and find himself still possessed of the same wonderful\nand extraordinary skill All Born Ventriloquists\nUnhappily there are other very prevalent misconceptions to be\nremoved before instruction can be either given or undertaken The\nmarvelous and almost incomprehensible powers attributed by the late\nMr Henry Cockton to his popular character, doubtless gave rise to the\nidea that ventriloquism was a gift natural only to those possessing\nunusual formation of the throat and vocal organs Modern research\nand investigation, however, have proved that every one is a born\nventriloquist, that the power to make sounds appear to emanate at a\npoint remote from the speaker is universal—and that all those who\nstudy the subject from a proper and sensible standpoint can easily\nacquire the art Then, again, it has long been supposed by the uninitiated that\nventriloquial practice is injurious to the throat, and capable of\nharming the lungs Exactly the opposite is the case; the exercises\nnecessitated by the proper study of the art are such as will serve not\nonly to train the vocal organs, but also to induce proper breathing—a\npractice neglected by many—and to strengthen and invigorate the\nlungs From many years’ personal experience the author can testify to the\ntruth of this fact; he has known a number of young men who,\npossessing lung and throat troubles, and acting on the foregoing\nadvice, have followed out a practical course of ventriloquial training,\nand have obtained much material benefit thereby Of course it cannot be denied that some possess a natural aptitude\nfor the correct expression of ventriloquial sound, and it is they who\nmake the cleverest exponents Therefore, from the start it should be\nassumed that a ventriloquist has only to cultivate the vocal\nqualifications with which he has been endowed in order to shine as a\npopular entertainer Careful and systematic attention to the instructions subjoined will\nnot only strengthen the throat and respiratory organs, but will also\nendow any one young man, or young woman, with the power of\ngiving a highly amusing entertainment Probably many who give this\nchapter attention will do so with the idea of taking up the subject for\nthe purpose of making a living, and in that respect it may truthfully\nbe said that ventriloquism is one of the most paying forms of\nentertainment While the number of conjurors, comic singers, &c , is\nlegion, those capable of giving a really good ventriloquial\nentertainment are comparatively few, with the result that a clever\nventriloquist is always certain of obtaining engagements at fees which\nhe, himself, can fix and command The popularity of the subject is so\nwidespread that the chances of exhibiting it are increasing every year The Initial Stages\nJust as the successful illusionist is called upon to devote many many\nhours of his time to the speedy and finished manipulation of cards,\ncoins, and billiard balls, so the young ventriloquist has an equally\nuninteresting course to traverse It is, however, possible for the initial\nstages of the work to be accomplished in less time than is the case\n\n\nwith conjuring, and while the work has to be done all the same, dry\nand tiresome though it may be, after it is once accomplished the\nperformer can put it behind him for ever The primary difficulty to be overcome is incorrect breathing Possibly nine out of ten, when they come to read this chapter, will\ndiscover that their method of breathing is faulty Most people, from\nlack of proper instruction and through carelessness, breathe through\nthe mouth—and this fault must be remedied at once For ventriloquism, as with singing, breathing must take place\nthrough the nostrils The necessity for this—apart from hygienic\nreasons—is that because the ventriloquist, particularly when he is\nperforming with a “lay” figure, is called upon to conduct a dual\nconversation, and the supposed interchange of remarks between him\nand the automaton is so rapid that mouth breathing would interfere\nwith the continuous flow of words Only by taking in deep inhalations\nthrough the nostrils and filling the lungs to their utmost capacity is it\npossible to carry on one part of the conversation with moving lips,\nand the other with the face immutably set Breathing Exercises\nThese should be undertaken regularly every day, preferably early in\nthe morning and in the open air Stand erect, shoulders drawn well\nback, arms hanging loosely at the sides, and then, closing the mouth\ntightly, draw in a deep breath, retaining it for some seconds in the\nlungs Not infrequently it happens, that the ventriloquist when\nperforming is called upon to keep a conversation going for quite a\nminute and a half without the opportunity of recharging the lung cells\nwith a fresh supply of oxygen; from this it will easily be understood\nhow important deep and sustained breathing is At first difficulty will be experienced in holding the breath for more\nthan five or six seconds; by the end of a week, after ten minutes’\npractice every morning, the chest will be so expanded and\nstrengthened that “half minute breaths” may be taken with ease Continue the practice of this exercise until only one inhalation and\nexhalation takes place every forty or fifty seconds Somewhat dry,\nindeed, sounds this part of the ventriloquial study; nevertheless it is of\nthe utmost importance, and will well repay the time, trouble, and\nperseverance devoted to it As a number of minor acquirements must be gained before\nventriloquial effects can be produced, the breathing exercises may be\nalternated with the most necessary adjunct of learning to speak\nwithout moving the lips",
    "As a number of minor acquirements must be gained before\nventriloquial effects can be produced, the breathing exercises may be\nalternated with the most necessary adjunct of learning to speak\nwithout moving the lips Automaton—or Man It has previously been said that ventriloquism largely partakes of\nthe nature of an illusion, and this effect is produced by the performer\nuttering sounds without giving visible indications of the fact Consequently, when the audience have before them two figures, a live\nand a dummy one, and the mouth of the “dummy” opens and shuts to\ncorrespond with the words used, whilst the face of the ventriloquist\nremains mask-like and passive—the illusion that it is the “automaton,”\nand not the man who is speaking, is complete So important indeed is the ability to do this properly, that speaking\nwithout facial movement ranks of equal importance with the placing\nof the vocal chords in such a position that “distant” effect is given to\nsound In fact, one might almost say that a most amusing\nentertainment can be given without this latter power at all Many ventriloquists or polyphonists, as they more correctly\ndesignate themselves, rely solely for their entertainment on a “knee”\nfigure and speech without facial expression Those who do not aspire to become really first-class and proficient\nventriloquists may conclude their instruction at this point, and rest\nquite assured that they have learned sufficient, at any rate, to give a\ncreditable drawing-room performance Naturally the beginner would like to have some idea of the time it\nwould take to gain a practical working knowledge of ventriloquism Well, the student who would take the trouble and devote sufficient\ntime to the initial and most difficult stages of the work would be in a\nposition to give a very creditable performance long before his\npainstaking brother who, as fast as he seems to be getting on, will find\nhe has to go back again and again over the early ground However, after devoting say a week to the elementary stages, a\n“knee” figure might be purchased, and within a very few days a\nprivate entertainment might safely be entered upon As, however, the\ncourse herewith outlined will take in several different kinds of\n“voices” for automata, together with the various modifications of the\n\n\n“distant” voice, the student should not expect to gain proficiency\nunder a month Of course, to give a really finished entertainment\nconsisting of an exhibition of the “near” and “distant” voices, together\nwith instrumental and vocal mimicry equal in skill to the average\nproduct of the professional entertainer, many months’ practice are\nrequired Speaking with Still Lips\nA study of the alphabet reveals that difficulties lie in the path of\npronouncing certain letters—a, e, i, o, u, c, d, g, h, j, k, l, n, q, r, s, t,\nx, and z—issue from the mouth quite easily; but b, f, m, p, v, w, y all\nmake a demand upon the muscles of the lips and cheeks Unfortunately these letters often recur in ordinary speech, and as it is\nalmost impossible to speak them distinctly without facial movement,\nappropriate vocal substitutes have to be made On the border line is “b,” which is generally pronounced by\nbringing the upper row of teeth down to the under lip and forcing the\nbreath out between the lip and teeth; by giving greater force to the\nexhalation, and, opening the mouth, it will be found that almost\nidentically the same sound can be gained, and it is this one which has\nto be used for all words commencing with “v” and “b ” Thus the word\n“brother” is really pronounced ventriloquially as “vruther”; in the\nhurry of conversation the substitution passes notice, and the audience\nhear only the correct word For “f” an accentuated aspirate makes a very passable substitution\n—i e “fool” becomes “hool,” “feel” becomes “heel,” and so on “m” will be found rather more difficult, but if the lips are formed\ninto an orifice, and the breath drawn sharply in, the sound of the “m”\ncan be made inside the mouth instead of by the lips As it is almost an impossibility to sound the initial “p” unless the\nlips come together, words commencing with it should be studiously\navoided Another plan is to drop the first letter altogether; but the\nformer is the better “w” is amenable to a little tongue-twisting, and is accomplished by\nmoving the tongue twice in quick succession to the roof of the mouth\nmaking the sound at the back of the throat This is as regards the\nletter itself, but words commencing with “w” are quite easy Practice\non “which,” “when,” “what ”\n\n\n“y,” however, is a fairly certain test, and if you can comfortably\nmanage this without betraying the fact to the looking-glass (before\nwhich you should carry out your practice) then you have mastered a\ngreat difficulty A quick exhalation should take place while words\ncommencing with it are being uttered Two Kinds of Ventriloquism\nVentriloquism may be divided into two classes—the first and more\neasy of acquirement known as “near,” i e including all those vocal\nillusions produced with the aid of automata; and “distant,” which\ntakes in the various illusions achieved by what is known as “throwing\nthe voice ”\nThe most finished exponent of both these branches, of this or any\nother age, was the great Lieutenant Walter Cole, and he introduced\ninto his entertainment such an exquisite blending of the two styles\nthat his example might well be imitated by other followers of the art When carrying on an animated conversation with the “lay” figures\nplaced at near quarters the proceedings would suddenly be\ninterrupted by the low sound of voices coming from afar, and this\nwould gradually increase in volume as the speakers were supposed to\ndraw near, until at last they would be heard outside the very room in\nwhich the entertainment was taking place This is alluded to now, as showing the latitude which ventriloquism\nallows its exponents Of the two branches, “near” ventriloquism is much the simpler to\nacquire, although some might hold that, in order to justify the title,\n“distant” sounds should first be mastered For the purpose of adding interest to the work, students are\nrecommended to give precedence to the “near” effects Briefly, the\n“near” voices come from the mouth, the “distant” from the throat For the former five modified voices are generally used These are:\n“The old man,” “the old woman,” “the little boy,” “the little girl,” and\n“the darky” or “the longshoreman ”\nThe first is a foundation for the last two",
    "”\nThe first is a foundation for the last two It has been spoken of as\nthe “grunt,” because, being the vocal production of an aged and\nuneducated man, in its initial stages it much resembles the familiar\ngrunting of a pig And here it should be noted that the speech of ventriloquial figures\n\n\nis always harsh and toneless because the efforts to produce the sound\nin the mouth without moving the lips rob them of that music and\nmodulation invariably associated with the speech of educated persons Do not attempt to speak ventriloquially, as you would naturally but\nslur the endings of your words Grunt and drag them out slowly, just\nas do many countrymen and those unacquainted with the rules of\nproper speech To give the sound the necessary depth and loudness, keep the lips\nslightly apart, the tongue lying loosely in the mouth; then make the\ngrunt, using some vowel sound like “ah ” fairly far back To a certain extent the vocal chords will have to be contracted and\nthe chin drawn slightly down into the chest At first only a spasmodic jerkiness of the breath will come, but after\na little practice “ah ” can be said quite easily, and then other and\nlonger words follow as a matter of course The Old Woman’s Voice\nKnown as the “theek” or “rush” voice, it partakes of the nature of\nthe squeaky, shrill sound produced by a reed instrument Most people\nare gifted with the power of singing “falsetto,” and the “theek” voice\nsimply consists of falsetto tones somewhat exaggerated Either the\nwords “queek” or “theek” may be used for the preliminary practice,\nthe latter perhaps being preferable As it is not intended in these chapters to enter into a practical\ndiscourse on the anatomy of the throat and vocal chords, technical\nterms relating to such will be avoided as far as possible However, the\nlarynx must now be mentioned—this is the part of the throat often\nspoken of as Adam’s apple, and is the convex portion of the first\ncartilage of the larynx It is, then, this part of the larynx that has to be\ncompressed by muscular contraction in order to give the “theek” voice\nits proper quality; by a slight pressure with the hand on the “apple”\nyou will realize the position which this part of the throat should\noccupy when muscular contraction takes place Now, taking in a deep breath and contracting the larynx, it will\nnaturally curl up the tongue, until the tip presses tightly against the\nroof of the mouth Open the lips fairly wide and say the word “theek”\nin a high-pitched falsetto tone, sustaining the vowel sound as long as\nyou can Your first efforts will probably end in dismal failure, but after a few\nattempts the full sound settles down to the long drawn-out sound of\nfull roundness and tone Now you have acquired the “theek” voice, which is also the basis of\nthe voices used with the figures of little boys and little girls Very possibly your practice in the elementary stages of\nventriloquism will result in a slight soreness of the throat To alleviate\nthis, and, at the same time, to strengthen the vocal chords, gargle with\na weak solution of salt and water, or better still, get a druggist to\nmake up a gargle for you Curiously enough, the mere effort of gargling is in itself a valuable\naid to the production of ventriloquism, inasmuch as the subject is\nforced to emit sounds while the water is in the throat, and these will\nbe found to possess quite a “distant” effect Having mastered the “grunt” and “theek” voices, use words\nconsisting of vowels, changing the words into sentences as progress is\nmade At this point the young ventriloquist is sufficiently well equipped to\nundertake a public exhibition of his powers, and this being so, it is\nperhaps better to make mention of ventriloquial figures before the\nremaining “near” voices are dealt with As a matter of fact, the practice of ventriloquism in its earlier stages\nis not the most interesting of occupations, and not until the beginner\nawakens to the full realization of his powers—as he does only when\nhe is working with automata—is the real fascination of the art felt Ventriloquial Figures\nPerhaps it is hardly right to assume that every one has seen a\nventriloquial figure; certainly many will be unacquainted with its\npeculiarities and modes of working The dummy is usually a humorous representation of some grotesque\ncharacter—an old man, with strongly accentuated peculiarities, such\nas a red nose, wrinkled skin, and big jaws; an old woman, with thin,\npointed nose, sharp eyes, and scanty locks; a little boy grinning\nsaucily, and having the appearance of possessing the wisdom of all the\nages; the little “miss,” of perky manner; the good-natured, rollicking\nblack man; and the longshoreman, square jowled and cheeky Fig 1 —Ventriloquist with knee figure Fig 2 —Working with two figures The one essential about the ventriloquial figure is that it shall have\na moving mouth In reality the chin is cut away from the face, and the\nmovable portion working on a pivot or string, gives the same effect as\nwhen a person is speaking There are many different forms of ventriloquial figures, some of\nwhich are shown on this page (Figs 1 and 2), but for the amateur the\nkind which possesses only a moving mouth is quite suitable Fig 3 —Showing construction of ventriloquial head By means of a little ingenuity and the expenditure of a few cents a\nmovable tuft of hair may be added to the wig, but as the working of\nthis is liable at first somewhat to hamper the manipulation of the\nautomaton, it should perhaps be left until proficiency is more assured The hole in the back of the head or body permits of the hand of the\nperformer pressing either upon a plate or upon a circle of wire, which\nin turn moves down the movable mouth, closing automatically by\nmeans of a spring Figs 3, 4 and 5 respectively show the construction\nof ventriloquial figure heads and another principle of ventriloquial\nfigure manipulation The number of mouth movements made by the figure should, of\ncourse, coincide as nearly as possible with the number made by the\nmouth in ordinary speech; thus a natural effect will be gained Placing a “dummy” on each knee, the ventriloquist opens up an\namusing conversation The aim of the figures is to destroy the effect of\nthe performer’s remarks by the interpolation of absurd interruptions The whole matter resolves itself into a witty dialogue between three\nor four people, of whom the entertainer is the central character Such\na dialogue should be brisk and sparkling with humor, all vulgarity\nbeing carefully eliminated It is as well to write the dialogue out and\nlearn it by heart Ventriloquial Figure Manipulation\n\n\nAlways adhere to a prearranged order of ventriloquial figures If\nyou commence your entertaining career with the old man on the right\nknee and the old woman on the left, keep to that arrangement all\nalong A change will inevitably result in putting the wrong voice into\nthe wrong mouth, and the result will be disastrous Bear in mind that all the while the endeavors of the figures are to\nmake you appear ridiculous in the eyes of the audience, and they\nshould turn all your sensible remarks into nonsensical ones, so that\nthe laugh is always against yourself Of course the audience will join\nin the laugh against you, and it is the taking of this in the proper\nspirit that will signalize your success as a ventriloquist When putting words into the mouth of an automaton, its face\nshould be turned towards you; inversely, whilst you yourself are\ntalking the automaton should be engaged in looking curiously about\nhim at the audience, as if taking not the slightest interest in your\nremarks Suddenly, however, he will snatch the opportunity of scoring\noff you, to the great enjoyment of his partner, the old woman A Pull\nFig 4 —Construction of laughing darky’s head B Spring\nC Pin\nFig 5 —Principle of ventriloquial figure manipulation Immediately you have finished speaking in your natural voice, keep\nyour lips absolutely fixed during the time the figure is supposed to be\ntalking It is not proposed here to give specimens of ventriloquial dialogue,\nbecause the humor of these depends so much upon the natural ability\nof the performer in presenting the joke or funny story Undoubtedly the best plan is to form a cutting-book out of the tit-\nbits extracted from the humorous periodicals of the day, and to paste\nthem in In this way a voluminous collection of anecdotes, tales, and\nriddles will be made, and by a judicious combination and selection of\nthese, enough material can be speedily gained to last months without\nfear of repetition The most entertaining form of presenting riddles is for the “old\nman” or “little boy,” whichever is being used, to propound them, and\nthe entertainer to give some practical answer to them The real point\nof the joke should be brought out by the “lay” figure, to the\naccompaniment of considerable mirth",
    "The real point\nof the joke should be brought out by the “lay” figure, to the\naccompaniment of considerable mirth Home-made automata are not recommended, because the cost of\npurchasing really serviceable “dummies” is so small as not to make it\nworth while spending a deal of time and trouble, to say nothing of\nmoney, on their construction Moreover, the great point about the\n“lay figure” is that it should possess a funny face, and such\nexpressions are rather difficult for an amateur to obtain Many entertainment emporiums deal largely in ventriloquian\noutfits, and reliable “dolls” ought to be procured fully dressed for\nabout $5 each Voice for “Little Boy”\nWhen a child speaks he almost invariably does so in a high-pitched\ntone, more or less directing the sound through his nose This being so,\nthe “theek” voice is the one most suitable for him The similarity\nbetween it and the speech used for the “old woman” may be avoided\nby speaking in a somewhat lower tone, and in a simpler and more\ndisjointed fashion Suppose, for instance, that you ask the little boy a question Get\nhim to repeat that question after you, and give the answer in short,\njerky, broken sentences Get\nhim to repeat that question after you, and give the answer in short,\njerky, broken sentences For the “little girl” use a slightly higher tone, without directing the\nsound through the nose In her case also the mode of expression must\nbe childish, but with slightly more refinement The voice for the “longshoreman” and the “darky” are both of the\n“grunt” order For the former, the “old man” voice is used, with the\naddition of the peculiar “tough” twang; whilst for the latter, employ\nspeech of a much lower and more resonant tone Place the chords as when using the “grunt” voice, breathing rather\nheavily, and force the sound as far back in the throat as possible, at\nthe same time contracting the muscles of the stomach while the\nbreath is being expelled The word “yah yah ” is a very good one upon which to practice,\n\n\nand the vowel sound should be sustained to some length The “Distant” Voices\nBy this time the young ventriloquist should have attained sufficient\nproficiency in the art of manipulating “knee” figures to feel confident\nof venturing on the far more difficult and relatively more important\n“distant” voices The real test of ventriloquial power is when the performer is\ncapable of making sounds appear to come from a distance, i e so\nmodify his utterances that they appear to the audience to proceed\nfrom some point remote both from the entertainer and from\nthemselves The basis of real ventriloquism, as apart from polyphony, i",
    "The basis of real ventriloquism, as apart from polyphony, i e “near”\neffects, is known as the “bee drone,” because the first sound of which\nthe vocal chords are capable when placed in the required position\nmuch resembles the droning of a bee in full flight The “bee drone” should be practiced in loosely fitting clothing, so\nthat neither the muscles of the throat nor of the chest are unduly\nhampered From a natural, upright position, inhale in a short, jerky manner,\nmaking what is best described as a retching noise at the back of the\nthroat Unpleasant as the practice of this undoubtedly is for the first\nfew minutes, after a short while the noise emitted will settle down to\na softly sustained hum The tongue should lie flat, so that the sound\nwaves produced partly in the larynx and partly in the back of the\nthroat are forced upwards by the action of the abdominal muscles and\ndirected towards the roof of the mouth, the latter acting somewhat as\na sounding board—modifying the sound and conveying to the ears of\na listener some distance away a “distant” effect The continuous practice of the word “ah,” with the vocal chords in\nthe position just described, will speedily produce the necessary\ndroning quality It remains now only by a contraction of the throat to regulate the\nquality of the tone and the distance from which you wish it to appear\nto come From this point progress will be found rapid and satisfactory The\nvarious modifications of the bee drone produce respectively,\n\n\n1 The “roof” voice 2 The “level” voice 3 The “floor” voice The “roof” voice is extremely useful for illusions of all kinds, and\nperhaps is the easiest of the three to acquire Its purpose is to make\nsound appear to come from any point above the audience, and the\nentertainer practices it at first by standing erect, taking in a deep\nbreath, and then drawing backwards and downwards the lower jaw,\nholding it by muscular contraction in that position With the lips\nabout an inch apart say your words, whatever they may be, just as\nyou would the “ah ” of the bee drone, concentrating your mind on the\neffort of directing the sound waves towards the roof of the mouth In\nthis case, however, exhalation should take place very slowly, while\nthe speech is uttered with unusual clearness The effect of the illusion, however, is destroyed if whilst using the\n“roof” voice you look either straight before you or down to the\nground The ventriloquist must bear in mind that it is important to deceive\nthe audience, just as a conjurer does, but the former has this\nadvantage over his magic brother, that the deception is both optical\nand oral Let him, therefore, when “throwing his voice” to the roof, glance\nsharply upwards as soon as the words are uttered, and turn his head\nin a listening attitude; his example will be followed immediately by\nthe audience, who naturally fall into the trap prepared for them, and,\nfor the time being, are quite satisfied that the sounds do really come\nfrom the roof This is an advantage on which the ventriloquist can trade to an\nenormous extent, because the ear is so easily deceived How difficult\nit is, when listening from within a closed room to a street organ\nplaying outside, to tell whether the music comes from up or down the\nroad So with ventriloquism—the performer has but to modify the\nposition of the vocal chords as indicated, and to fix his eyes upon the\nroof, when lo and behold everybody is perfectly satisfied that the\nspeech does come from above “Level” Sounds\n\n\nOf the three “distant” voices, the “level” is, perhaps, the most useful\nand the most generally successful, because the mere fact of the\nentertainer being on the same plane as the door and the windows,\nfrom behind which people are supposed to converse with him,\nprovides him with opportunities for using the facial muscles and for\ndistorting sounds, and so heightening the illusion For instance, whereas he must turn full or three-quarter face when\nusing the “roof” voice, he can carry on a dialogue on the “level,”\nsideways to the audience; or in the case where the stage possesses a\ndoor at the rear, he may often be permitted for a moment to turn his\nback Practice as before in the “bee drone” voice, without endeavoring to\nany great extent to shut off the sound in the throat This may be done\nby curling up the tongue so that its tip presses against the back of the\nupper teeth If you are practicing by the side of the door, as you open it towards\nyou the ventriloquially uttered sounds must be raised in tone and\nmade more distinct by lifting the shutter from the throat, or, in other\nwords, by allowing the tongue to resume its normal position, and the\nsounds to issue forth on the principle of the “bee drone ”\nThe “Floor” Voice\nThis voice is extremely useful for such illusions as “the man in the\ncellar attending to the gas meter,” &c It calls particularly for a display\nof histrionic powers, and the mere fact of bending down, as the\nsounds appear to come from below, helps to give it the necessary\nsubdued and “distant” effect Whilst speaking very slowly in the “bee\ndrone” thrust the chin forward, contracting the larynx as much as you\npossibly can; roll back the tongue to stifle the sound in the throat, and\nthe illusion will be complete Immediately you change from the\n“floor” to the natural voice, resume the standing position and speak\nwith unusual distinctness The contrast cannot fail to escape the\nnotice of the audience, who will be quite convinced that you have\nindeed carried on a conversation with some one below Ventriloquial Imitations\n\n\nAlthough imitations can hardly be classed under the heading of\npure ventriloquism, yet they may be pressed into the service of the\nentertainer to promote variety in his performance They serve, too,\nanother very useful purpose, inasmuch as they provide a relief from\nwhat must inevitably prove a strain on the vocal chords As has\nalready been said, ventriloquism necessitates the placing of the vocal\nchords in a somewhat unnatural position, and the result is that the\nexponent, particularly in the early stages of the work, is apt speedily\nto become tired As a break between an exhibition of “near” ventriloquism—that is,\nwith the automata—and an exposition of distant effects, one or two\nvocal or instrumental imitations will prove welcome both to the\nentertainer and the entertained A witty person once remarked that the secret of success lies not so\nmuch in what you can do, as in what you can induce other people to\nthink you can do In other words, a little knowledge in the hands of a\nready-witted and competent ventriloquist can be turned to great\nadvantage and become a valuable asset in his undertakings For\nsuccessful imitations, self-confidence is perhaps of even greater\nimportance than the possession of real ventriloquial powers Self-\nconfidence is a trump card that the ventriloquist should always hold\nin his hand, because it will take all the tricks Success is impossible\nwithout it, and easy with it Perhaps there are few branches of entertaining in which self-\nassurance is so necessary as in ventriloquial mimicry The border-line\nbetween a successful imitation and a ludicrous failure is oft-times so\nnarrow, that a sensitive soul would soon be disheartened The only difference between the efforts of the ordinary and the\nventriloquial mimic is that the latter, when giving expression to\nsounds vocally produced, should place the chords in the same position\nas for the “bee drone” and the “distant” voice A very good study is that of a hen as she cackles immediately before\nlaying an egg, and again after having done so You will notice that the\nfirst sounds are mostly of a guttural nature, and they should come\nfrom well back in the throat, starting moderately high and descending\nfour or five notes Of course the lips will have to be kept slightly\nopened, and for the final jubilant crow considerably extended To\navoid the necessary facial movement, it is as well when uttering the\n“crow” to turn sideways to the audience Again, while the first note of\nthe cackling should be loud, the successive notes grow quieter A Dog Fight\nAn imitation of a dog fight will form a spirited item in your\nprogramme By your actions you may suggest, for instance, a small\ncur yapping vigorously until a larger and more ferocious animal\nendeavors to quiet him To produce the higher notes of the dog-bark, the falsetto or “thick”\nvoice must be used, while the deeper guttural tones already explained\nfor use with the “darky” serve for the larger dog It is a little difficult to intersperse the two sets of sounds without\nexpressing facial contortion, but you may obtain for yourself a certain\namount of license by pretending that the dog fight is taking place\nbeneath a covered table, behind which you may stoop in your\nsupposed endeavors to stop the tumult It is but natural to turn from dogs to cats Whereas you have just\ngiven an imitation, perhaps, of a fierce duel, your next effort should\nendeavor to portray a feline courtship This should be made as funny\nas possible The lady’s “marr-rr-ows” and “mia-a-a-ows” are easily\ncopied after you have been kept awake a night or two listening to the\ngenuine article, whilst the deeper tones of Mr Tom are included in\nthe repertory of every well-educated schoolboy",
    "Tom are included in\nthe repertory of every well-educated schoolboy The mouth should be kept fairly wide open and a kind of sideways\nmotion given to it, whilst the cry should be drawled until the lips\nform for the final “ow ” The spittings and growlings necessitate the\nbringing together of the lips and teeth, a freedom which your\naudience on this occasion must permit you The doleful moans with\nwhich our feline friends endeavor to solace one another can be\nproduced by making the mouth very hollow, the lips into the form of\na large O, slowly contracted to a very small one For the die-away, distant effect, moaning more or less in the throat\nmust be resorted to The finale can consist of a number of fierce\nspittings and growlings, suddenly interrupted by an unmistakably\nhuman voice (your own) “shoo-ing” the night visitants away A variation can be made by giving an imitation of pouring out a\nglass of wine To produce the illusion of drawing the cork from the\nbottle, turn slightly round, thrust the forefinger into the mouth\nagainst the cheek, close the lips around the finger, slowly bring the\nend of the finger round inside the cheek, and force it smartly out\nthrough the lips The result will be a loud pop By moving the tongue\n\n\nfrom the back of the mouth quickly backwards and forwards, making\nit strike against the inside of the gums, the “glug, glug” of the wine\nbeing poured out will be plainly heard The Lion and the Cow\nUnder the cover of a screen, the roaring of a lion is simple of\naccomplishment Use an ordinary lamp chimney, and give vent to a\nseries of deep-throated roars from this The effect will both be natural\nand startling With the same instrument the deep lowing of a cow can\nbe perfectly imitated, the lips producing the familiar “moo,” the sound\nbeing gradually drawled through the glass chimney To copy a saw at work is quite easy Get a ruler, or some similar\narticle, to represent the saw, and draw it backwards and forwards as\nthough cutting a piece of wood The sound is best made by clenching\nthe teeth, placing the tongue a little forward between the upper and\nlower teeth, quickly inhaling and exhaling the air The resultant noise\nwill be an exact imitation of the saw cutting its way through the\nwood Quite an effective item is the ascent of a rocket By blowing hard\nthrough pursed lips, and striking the mouth rapidly with sharp little\nblows with closed fingers, the curious sound of an ascending rocket\nmay be reproduced with perfect fidelity This slowly fades away, there\nis a moment’s pause, and then the final pop as the stars burst Naturally such an imitation should be performed in the shelter of the\nscreen As a last example, an imitation of the itinerant knife-grinder\nmay be attempted Keep the lips and the teeth closed to produce the\nrasping up and down of the steel upon the grindstone, the while\nworking an imaginary treadle with the right foot The Complete Entertainment\nBy this time the young ventriloquist should have at his command\nboth “near” and “distant” voices and imitations It only remains to say\na few words regarding the manner of giving an entertainment Although smart dialogue is very entertaining, it is apt, after a little\nwhile, to pall; and to obviate this it will be found well to introduce an\noccasional song or comic recitation In both cases these may take the\n\n\nform of parodies, but in the former a serious song really well sung by\nthe ventriloquial figure will evoke both admiration and applause Those not possessed of particularly good vocal qualifications may\nfeel that the singing of a song successfully is beyond their capabilities They should, however, bear in mind that nothing like “finish” or\ncleverness in execution is expected from a wooden figure One or two\nverses and the chorus are quite enough to venture upon, as singing\nventriloquially is extremely tiring The best time to introduce a song is when dialogue between\nyourself and the automata has been in progress for seven or eight\nminutes Either the little boy or the old man or the old woman can\nessay to try his or her skill as a vocalist, or the affair may be\ncompetitive Much amusement may be caused by the little boy\nextolling his own skill as a vocalist, and the darky challenging him To\nsettle the matter, let one sing the first verse of a song and the other\nthe second, the little boy making a terrible hash of his part of the\nperformance If his mistakes are greeted with groans of derision from\nthe old man, or cries of horror from the old woman, the audience will\nbe immensely pleased While the song is in progress, the ventriloquist should look about\nhim unconcernedly, feigning total disinterestedness in the affair Towards the end of the song he may glance sharply once or twice at\nthe singer and applaud him for his effort, which applause it is to be\nhoped the audience will generously supplement",
    "Towards the end of the song he may glance sharply once or twice at\nthe singer and applaud him for his effort, which applause it is to be\nhoped the audience will generously supplement It is not intended that these few observations on the art of\nventriloquism should be taken as covering all the ground over which\nthis fascinating subject spreads Enough has been said, however, to\nshow any one who is sufficiently interested how to give a really\npleasing drawing-room performance which shall earn for him the\nreputation of being quite a creditable exponent of the wondrous and\nmystifying art of Valentine Vox CHAPTER XX\nCONJURING FOR ALL\nMagic Memorized\nIt is said that at some period of his life every boy becomes stage-\nstruck, and it may be averred with equal truth that sooner or later\nevery boy is seized with a desire to become a conjurer Considering the fascination to old and young alike of a conjuring\nentertainment, this is not to be wondered at But when the would-be\nconjurer begins to realize the years and years of practice necessary\nbefore he can accomplish his desire, he soon despairs; and instead of\nproudly mounting the platform as an entertainer, he finally satisfies\nhimself by humbly occupying a chair as one of the entertained It is the purpose of this chapter, however, to set forth a complete\nconjuring entertainment in such a manner that anybody can easily\nlearn and perform it, in precisely the same manner as they would\nmemorize and deliver a recitation Before proceeding with the tricks themselves, it will perhaps be\nadvisable, for the sake of the uninitiated, briefly to describe how to fit\nup a handy conjuring table Fig 1 —A handy conjuring table Procure a small wooden box about six inches deep and one foot in\nlength and width, and stand it in the center of a small gypsy-table Then artistically drape one or two flags, or a brightly-colored cloth\nover it (Fig 1) It will be noticed that a portion of the table at the back of the box is\nleft vacant",
    "It will be noticed that a portion of the table at the back of the box is\nleft vacant This, in the dialect of the profession, is known as the\nservante It is used for secretly disposing of objects during the\nperformance The magic wand simply consists of a decorated circular stick about\nten inches long Each trick will be dealt with in three separate parts The first will\ndescribe the illusion from the point of view of the audience; the\nsecond will explain the apparatus required; and the third the “patter”\n\n\naccompanying each trick Presentation —As seen by the audience, the first trick is as follows:\nTwo ping-pong balls are lying upon the table, and the conjurer\nrequests a member of the audience to choose one This having been\ndone, the performer picks up the selected ball and commences gently\nrubbing it in the palms of his hands, when to the amazement of the\naudience, the ball is seen to change into a couple of handkerchiefs The conjurer places one of these upon the table, and proceeds to\nwrap up the other in a piece of pink paper Blowing out a candle\nwhich has been standing in a candlestick upon the table, the\nperformer wraps that also into a similar parcel, using white paper\ninstead of pink He next places the two parcels at opposite ends of the table, in full\nview of the audience After making one or two passes with the magic\nwand, the conjurer picks up the parcel containing the candle He then\ntears it open, when it is found to contain the handkerchief Upon the\nremaining parcel being examined the candle is discovered within it Apparatus required —(1) Two ping-pong balls A large hole must be\nbored in one by means of a penknife Fig 2 —False candle containing handkerchief (2) Three small silk handkerchiefs Two of these should be stuffed\ninto the prepared ball through the hole Both balls must then be\nplaced upon the conjuring table—the hole in the prepared one being\nturned away from the audience (3) An ordinary candle wrapped in a piece of pink paper, and\nconcealed in readiness on the servante Another piece of pink paper\nand a piece of white should also be ready at hand (4) A “false” candle This is made by gumming a piece of white\npaper into the form of a cylinder, and sticking a slice from a real\ncandle in one end The third handkerchief must be stuffed into the\n“false” candle (Fig 2), which should then be placed in a candlestick From a short distance it will be impossible to distinguish this candle\nfrom the genuine article, and the effect will be considerably\nheightened by the candle-end being lit Patter —The conjurer comes forward to the front of the platform\nand delivers himself somewhat after the\nfollowing:—\n“Ladies and gentlemen—you will observe upon my table two ping-\n\n\npong or table-tennis balls They are quite innocent-looking, and\nalthough in appearance they somewhat resemble eggs, will not be\nfound half so deceptive Will some lady or gentleman kindly select\none ”\nIf the ball containing the handkerchief is selected the conjurer picks\nit up and proceeds with the trick Should the other be chosen,\nhowever, it makes no difference The entertainer simply hands it to\nthe person who has made the selection, and remarks: “Very well Would you mind taking the ball you have chosen and examining it ”\nUpon the person complying with his request, the conjurer picks up the\nremaining ball—the prepared one—and continues with the trick “Ladies and gentlemen,” he says, slowly rubbing the ball between\nthe palms of his hands, and carefully extracting the first handkerchief\nfrom its interior (a simple effort in sleight-of-hand, quickly acquired),\n“we will now see what effect a little friction has Ah Something is\nhappening already ”\nThe performer allows the second handkerchief to stream forth, and\nthen gradually opens his hands, taking care that one of the\nhandkerchiefs completely covers the ball and hides it from view He\nthen lays the handkerchief sheltering the ball carelessly upon the\ntable If this is done in a natural manner, the audience will not have\nthe slightest suspicion that it covers anything at all Holding the\nremaining handkerchief up to view, he continues:\n“We will now see whether this inherits any of the marvelous\nproperties of the ball from which it was produced I have here a piece\nof paper ” (Holds up the red paper ) “It contains neither trap-doors,\nhidden mirrors, nor other mechanical contrivances",
    ") “It contains neither trap-doors,\nhidden mirrors, nor other mechanical contrivances The reason for my\nusing pink paper is that it insures the trick being performed to the\npink of perfection I will now proceed to roll up the handkerchief in\nthe paper ”\nThis is done, the performer taking care to make the parcel exactly\nsimilar in shape to that of the candle on the servante During the\nwrapping-up process, however, he carelessly drops the parcel on the\nservante With a muttered excuse for his clumsiness, the conjurer again\nresorts to quickness of the hand, and picks up the parcel containing the\ncandle The very audacity of this movement will effectually keep the\naudience from suspecting that a substitution has been effected “I will now take this candle and wrap it in the piece of white paper\nI have here By the way, can any one tell me what nobleman could\nvery well be represented by a burnt-out candle No one Why, the\n\n\nEarl of Wicklow ” (He blows out the “false” candle and wraps it in the\nwhite paper )\n“You see I have now two parcels—the pink one containing the\nhandkerchief, the white one containing the candle I will place them\nat opposite ends of the table, and make a few passes with my magic\nwand ”\nThe performer waves the wand a few times Then, seizing the\npacket containing the “false” candle, he rips it open, thus tearing the\npaper cylinder, and revealing the handkerchief The small wax candle-\nend will escape observation amongst the torn paper, and the audience\nwill be under the impression that the candle has changed to a\nhandkerchief “Will a gentleman kindly step forward and examine the remaining\nparcel ” (Upon the examination being made it is found, of course, to\ncontain the candle ) “What The handkerchief and candle appear to\nhave disagreed with the quarters I originally allotted them, and have\nchanged places I think you will agree with me that this little\nexperiment has terminated in a very interesting manner I think you\nwill also agree that I have not once attempted to deceive you, as the\nwhole of the experiment was conducted before your very eyes ”\nThe second trick might very aptly be entitled\nThe Dye-Works\nPresentation —The conjurer hands round for inspection a small sheet\nof white paper Upon its being returned, he rolls it into a cylinder Taking a couple of red silk handkerchiefs from the table, he proceeds\nto poke them into the tube by means of the magic wand He continues\nto force them down until they at length make their appearance at the\nother end During this short passage through the tube, however, an\nastonishing transformation has ensued Instead of the handkerchiefs\nbeing red, one emerges a deep blue and the other yellow Yet upon\nthe roll of paper being passed round for inspection it is found to be\nperfectly empty Fig 3",
    "3 —Cardboard tube with silk bag and handkerchief attached Apparatus required —(1) Two red, one blue, and a yellow silk\nhandkerchief (2) A sheet of stout white paper about six inches long by five wide (3) A small cardboard tube about three inches long and an inch and\na half in diameter A section cut from an ordinary postal tube will do\nadmirably A small bag of yellow silk must be sewn by its edges to the interior\nof this tube (Fig A small bag of yellow silk must be sewn by its edges to the interior\nof this tube (Fig 3) 3) The yellow handkerchief should next be stitched\nby its center to the bag, as is shown in the same diagram This done,\nboth the yellow and blue handkerchiefs must be forced into the\ncardboard tube until they are completely hidden There will be no\ndifficulty in doing this, as silk can be made to occupy a very small\nspace The bag, of course, will prevent the handkerchiefs coming out\nat the other end The cardboard tube and its contents should then be placed upon the\ntable, and the two red handkerchiefs laid carelessly over it in order to\nobscure it from the view of the audience Patter —“I have here an ordinary sheet of white paper I intend,\nhowever, to turn it to a rather extraordinary purpose; in fact, to\nmanufacture with it a dye-works “I first roll the paper into a cylinder—so Please notice that I do not\nattempt to insert anything as I do so ”\nThe performer rolls up the paper, taking care to make it sufficiently\nlarge to admit the little cardboard tube “I have also two red silk handkerchiefs Every lady present to-night\nwill know how very difficult it is to dye anything that is red Nevertheless, I am going to put these handkerchiefs down my dye-\nworks’ chimney ”\nHe picks up the handkerchiefs—with the tube still hidden in them—\nand apparently attempts to poke them into the cylinder In reality,\nhowever, he only inserts the cardboard tube, and then pauses, as\nthough in doubt “Well, ladies and gentlemen, it appears as if I haven’t built my dye-\nworks large enough to receive both handkerchiefs together I think it\nwill be advisable, therefore, to insert them singly ”\nThe conjurer proceeds to place first one and then the other\nhandkerchief in the tube Then, taking up his magic wand he rams\nthem well down This has the effect of forcing them both into the\nsmall cardboard tube, thus liberating the blue and yellow\nhandkerchiefs “Ah I see that one of the handkerchiefs is issuing from the\nbasement of our dye-works And the color has been altered during its\n\n\njourney Here comes the other straight from the mangle, and, as you\nwill observe, it is now dyed yellow The dye-works has proved most\nsuccessful In fact, I believe that if I’d inserted a third handkerchief it\nwould have come out folded and ironed ”\nFig 4",
    "4 —Handkerchief covering small cardboard tube drawn from cylinder So saying, the conjurer takes the yellow handkerchief by its middle\nand draws it from the paper cylinder The cardboard tube, with the\nred handkerchiefs safely in it, will, of course, be drawn out at the\nsame time The folds of the yellow handkerchief, however, will\ncompletely hide it (Fig 4) The conjurer then throws the paper\ncylinder amongst the audience, with the\nremark—\n“There you are, ladies and gentlemen As I am of a philanthropic\nnature, I will let you have my dye-works free of charge, with full\npermission to make whatever use you like of them ”\nThe third trick may be called\nThe Dissolving Coin\nPresentation —The conjurer, standing a glass of water upon his\ntable, borrows a quarter, and places it in the center of a loaned\nhandkerchief He then requests a member of the audience to hold it\nover the glass so that the folds of the handkerchief hang around it and\ncompletely hide it from view (Fig 5) The performer next asks the person holding the coin to let it drop\ninto the water He does so, and the audience hear it tinkle as it strikes\nthe bottom of the glass But when the handkerchief is removed, the\nquarter has disappeared Fig 5 —The dissolving coin Fig 6 —Quarter found inside the orange A dish containing a number of oranges is standing upon the table The conjurer picks up a knife and plunges it into one Passing it to a\nmember of the audience, he requests him to cut it open Upon this\nbeing done the quarter is discovered embedded in the center of the\nfruit (Fig",
    "Upon this\nbeing done the quarter is discovered embedded in the center of the\nfruit (Fig 6) Apparatus required —(1) A glass of water (2) A silver quarter (3) A\nwatch-glass the size of a quarter One can be purchased for five cents\nfrom any watch repairer’s One can be purchased for five cents\nfrom any watch repairer’s (4) A dish of oranges A small cut must be\nmade in one of them, and the quarter forced into the incision The\nprepared orange should then be replaced upon the dish, care being\ntaken that its position is remembered Patter —“It is always a conjurer’s duty, during some part of his\nentertainment, to borrow The time is now ripe for me to perform that\npleasant duty Will some one kindly supply me with a quarter and a\nhandkerchief ”\nAs the performer walks amongst the audience to obtain the\nhandkerchief, he secretly takes the watch-glass from his waistcoat\npocket—where it has been placed in readiness As he returns to his\ntable with the handkerchief and the coin, and whilst his back is to the\naudience, he must again resort to sleight-of-hand and substitute his\nwatch-glass for the coin, which can either be slipped into his\nwaistcoat pocket, or dropped surreptitiously on to the servante The\nperformer then faces the audience, holding up the watch-glass instead\nof the coin in the center of the handkerchief “I have placed the quarter in the handkerchief, and should now like\nthe assistance of a young gentleman “Thank you, sir Would you mind holding this coin over the glass\nand let it fall into the water when I count three Thank you One—\ntwo—three You’re sure you dropped it Well, will you please remove\nthe handkerchief, thus taking the quarter from the water ” (The\nwatch-glass, being transparent, will be invisible at the bottom of the\nglass, and the assistant will immediately declare that the coin has\nvanished )\n“It’s gone, you say That’s rather awkward for the gentleman from\nwhom I borrowed it But perhaps you’d like to pay him back yourself You strongly object Well, I must see what I can do ”\nThe conjurer walks over to the dish of oranges “In order to see how this trick is done, ladies and gentlemen, you\nmust keep one eye upon me, one eye upon that dish of oranges, and\n\n\nthe other upon the gentleman who is assisting me What’s that You\nhaven’t three eyes I think you are mistaken First there’s your right\neye; then there’s your left eye; and your nect(eye)ie makes the third ”\nThe performer then plunges a knife into the prepared orange and\nhands it to his assistant “Would you mind cutting that in half ” (Upon doing so the young\ngentleman will, of course, find the coin embedded in the fruit ) “You\nhave found the missing coin in its center I consider it rather clever of\nme to purchase for a few cents oranges that grow quarters Would you\nmind returning the coin to its owner; and I must thank you for the\nvery able assistance you have afforded me ”\nThe next trick may be called\nThe Watch and Target\nPresentation —The conjurer borrows a watch from a member of the\naudience and wraps it in a piece of paper He next places it in the\nmuzzle of a pistol, and then stands a target upon the table Handing\nthe pistol to a gentleman in the audience, the performer requests him\nto fire at the target There is a loud report, and—hey, presto —the\nwatch is found swinging in the center of the target And upon the\npaper parcel which contained the watch being removed from the\npistol’s muzzle it is found to be perfectly empty Fig 7 —Conjuring pistol, showing flanged cap Fig 8 —Cup or pan to fit into muzzle of pistol Apparatus required —(1) A piece of paper in which to wrap the\nborrowed watch; and a second piece of the same size and color This\nmust be folded to create the impression that it contains a watch (2) An ordinary toy pistol This must be taken to a tinsmith, in\norder to have a tin muzzle of the shape shown in Fig 7 soldered to\nthe barrel It will also be necessary for the tinsmith to make another\nvery important addition to the pistol It consists of the little pan\nillustrated in Fig 8",
    "8 This pan fits into the muzzle But in order that it\n\n\nmay not sink down too far, and can be removed easily, a flange must\nbe made round the edge, as shown in Figs But in order that it\n\n\nmay not sink down too far, and can be removed easily, a flange must\nbe made round the edge, as shown in Figs 7 and 8 Before\ncommencing the trick, the piece of paper folded into the shape of a\nwatch must be placed inside the muzzle, and the tin pan fitted into\nposition on top of it Fig 9 —Showing front of target Fig 10 —Back of target with revolving center (3) A target (Fig 9) This target, as might be anticipated, is not so\nsimple as it looks The “bull’s-eye” at the center must be cut\ncompletely out with a fretsaw, and then replaced again on the two\npivots (B B, Fig 10) A small wooden clip should next be fixed in the\nposition illustrated by C, and a piece of elastic fastened to the “bull’s-\neye” at A, and stretched to the other side of the target It will now be observed that the tendency of the elastic is to make\nthe “bull’s-eye” revolve upon its pivots The wooden catch C,\nhowever, prevents this happening The catch is secured to the target by a single nail or screw, in\nprecisely the same manner as the “button” is fixed to an ordinary\ncupboard door A piece of black thread must be fastened to one end of\nthe catch, and carried down behind the target through a series of\nhooks made from bent pins (D, Fig 10) A pull at the thread thus causes the wooden catch to release the\n“bull’s-eye,” which will instantly be forced round upon its pivots by\nthe elastic, and show the other side:—which must be similarly painted\nwith rings—to the audience To complete the target, drive a small\nhook into the center of the “bull’s-eye ” The finished article must then\nbe placed behind a screen in readiness for the performance Fig 11 —The elastic at A will be found invaluable to the young conjurer (4) Lastly, a small piece of black elastic should be sewn across the\nV-shaped opening at the bottom of the conjurer’s waistcoat, as shown\nin Fig 11",
    "11 This keeps the bottom of the waistcoat perfectly tight, thus\nmaking a handy receptacle for any article the performer may poke up\nit out of sight Patter —“Ladies and gentlemen—I was so successful in borrowing\nfor my last trick, that I am encouraged to be a little less timid in my\nrequests Will some gentleman kindly lend me his watch Thank you,\nsir I may muddle up the wheels a bit during my experiment; but I\nsuppose you don’t mind that, provided the watch looks all right when\nI return it Now, sir, would you mind wrapping your watch up in this\npiece of paper ”\nWhilst the lender of the watch is engaged in wrapping up his\nproperty, the conjurer walks to the table and returns with the pistol in\nhis hand He then takes the parcel from the gentleman, and\napparently places it in the muzzle In reality, however, it is put only\ninto the small pan The performer turns round, and walks towards his table Holding\nthe pistol well into the body so that it is completely screened from the\naudience, he quickly places his right hand over the muzzle, and grips\nthe flange with his thumb and little finger It is then only the work of\na moment to lift the pan and its contents from the pistol, and poke it\nunder his waistcoat As the performer’s back is to the audience, these\nrapid movements escape observation Upon reaching the table the conjurer lays down the pistol, faces the\naudience, and says:\n“Well, now that I’ve got my ammunition, I suppose I’d better get a\ntarget ”\nHe retires behind the screen sheltering the target Hastily taking the\npan from his waistcoat, he tears the watch from the paper, and hangs\nit upon the hook on the reverse side of the “bull’s-eye ” Then,\nreturning to the platform, he places the target upon the table, and\ntaking up the pistol, says:\n“Will the gentleman who lent me the watch kindly take this pistol\nand fire at the target when I count three ” (Upon taking the pistol the\ngentleman will see the second piece of paper in the muzzle, and\nimagine that it contains the watch ) “Are you ready One —I hope\nyou are a good shot Two —Mind you don’t hit me instead of the\ntarget THREE ”\nAs he utters the last word the conjurer pulls the thread, and\nsimultaneous with the report of the pistol, the “bull’s-eye” flashes\nround and reveals the watch hanging to its center Of course the thread must be sufficiently long to permit the\nperformer to stand a short distance from the target Against a dark\nbackground the thread will be quite invisible to the audience Upon the second parcel being examined it will, of course, be found\nquite empty CHAPTER XXI\nSOME KNOTTY POINTS\nSecrets of Handkerchief Manipulation\nFig 1 —Handkerchief twisted for the performance Fig 2 —The one hand knot The following explanations are intended to provide the beginner\nwith the knowledge necessary to perform a few of the simple but neat\ntricks which can be done with no other apparatus than a\nhandkerchief For a short turn or “gag” these tricks are effective and\nuseful, whilst their very simplicity renders a quick return for the little\ntrouble required to learn them A good-sized silk handkerchief must be procured Before making\nany of the knots it should be twisted like a rope (Fig 1) Being of silk,\nthe handkerchief will not untwine easily The One Hand Knot\nThis knot is very simple to make Hold the handkerchief, bent\ndouble, across the right hand (Fig 2) Now, suddenly drop the hand,\nletting the fingers pass over the end, A, and catch the end, B, at the\npoint, C, between the first and second fingers Let the remainder of\nthe handkerchief slip off the hand, giving it a sharp flick, which will\ntighten the knot already loosely formed Practice constantly until the whole movement can be done very\nrapidly To the spectators it will appear as if you have suddenly\nflicked the handkerchief into a knot, and the effect will be striking The Wrist Knot\nStretch the handkerchief between the finger and thumb in both\n\n\nhands, as in Fig",
    "The Wrist Knot\nStretch the handkerchief between the finger and thumb in both\n\n\nhands, as in Fig 3 Cast a loop towards the left hand, taking care that\nit is thrown outwards As the loop is made, the left hand, still with the\nend of the handkerchief between finger and thumb, is passed smartly\nthrough the loop from the outside—shown by the dotted lines in the\nillustration This loop is now loosely round the left wrist, and the knot can be\nmade taut by pulling the ends with both hands The instant it is drawn\ntight let go of the ends of the handkerchief, and the result will be that\na simple twitch of the right hand has seemed to tie a knot firmly\nround your left wrist The Double Bow\nThis very pretty trick can be accomplished by making a double bow\nwith a rapid turn of the hands Hold the twisted handkerchief in both hands, as shown by Fig Hold the twisted handkerchief in both hands, as shown by Fig 4 The two hands are marked L and R—i e , left and right respectively Now bring the right hand round and past the left, as indicated by the\ndotted lines, and nip the handkerchief at the point A with the first and\nsecond fingers of the right hand Fig 3 —The wrist knot Fig 4 —The double bow By doing this you have naturally brought the point B opposite the\nfirst and second fingers of the left hand, between which it should be\nsimilarly nipped During all these movements the remaining fingers\nand thumbs of each hand should retain their original hold on the\nhandkerchief Having now taken hold of both the points A and B, straighten your\nhands and pull apart, still retaining the hold of the first and second\nfingers As a result you will find the handkerchief tied in a double\nbow, which, if the movements have been done quickly and well, will\nseem to have been accomplished by some strange effect of magic The Instantaneous Knots\nThese knots can be made at each end of the handkerchief by the\nfollowing method Hold the handkerchief in the position shown in Fig 5, where it appears lying over the third and fourth fingers with the\ntwo ends, A and B, hanging beyond the thumbs The movements are\ndone in the same way and simultaneously with both hands, and it will\ntherefore suffice to describe the action of your right hand Fig 5 —Instantaneous knots Bring the first and second fingers (1 and 2, Fig 5) over C, catching\nhold of the end, A, behind the wrist This will be easy after a few\nattempts, but you must be careful to see that the end A is of fair\nlength, otherwise the trick will be impossible Now bring the end A up through the resulting loop by means of the\ntwo fingers The consequence will be a knot in the end of the\nhandkerchief Your left hand has, meanwhile, been doing the same\nthing and with equal rapidity, so that it will appear to the spectators\nthat, by a sudden flash of the hands, you have formed two tight knots,\none at each end of the silk A Flick Knot\nHold the handkerchief stretched between your two hands in the\nmanner shown in Fig 6—that is, inside the first and second, and\noutside the third and fourth fingers of each hand Fig 6 —A flick knot Give the left hand a half turn, as in Fig 7, thus enabling the first\nand second fingers of the right hand to grip the end A, whilst at the\nsame moment the thumb and third finger of your left hand catch hold\nof the end B Fig 7 —Second stage of the flick knot Slip free the fingers of the left hand, excepting those holding the\nhandkerchief, and you will find a loosely made knot A smart flick of\nthe right hand will now complete the trick, and if you have done all\nthis very rapidly none of the movements will have been noticed by\nthe audience The Disappearing Knot\nThe foregoing remarks have dealt entirely with making knots in the\nhandkerchief By following the instructions now given you will be\nable to make a knot disappear entirely Take two differently colored handkerchiefs—red and white, for\ninstance, and cross them, as in Fig",

    "The audience first witnesses the performer—who is generally made\nup as a Chinaman—and a young lady dressed in white, standing in the\ncenter of a small “black stage,” as shown in Fig 1 Fig 1 —The floating head The performer then throws a white cloth over the lady’s head Without a moment’s pause he draws it away again, and—hey, presto —the lady is headless The Chinaman next takes a larger cloth, and\nholds it before the lady in such a manner that she is entirely hidden\nfrom the spectators A second later, however, he drops the cloth to the\nground This time the audience is treated to the spectacle of the head\nof the lady floating in the air More wonderful still, the head can\nspeak, sing, and answer any questions that may be put to it After a while the illusionist picks up the cloth, and holding it before\nthe head, once more cuts off the view of the spectators Upon its being\ndrawn away for the third time, nothing whatever is visible—even the\nmysterious head has vanished But when the cloth is held up again\nand withdrawn, the young lady—in her entirety—appears, and after\nbowing to the audience, walks unconcernedly off the stage Almost every well-known conjurer has stated at one time or another\nthat the secret of his success may be summed up in the one word—\npractice But there are very few young ladies who would have either\nthe courage or the ability to practice being decapitated The ordeal\nmight prove a trifle too exciting However, they may pass through it\nwithout fear if the following method, given in explanation of the\nillusion, be adopted The interior of the stage must be fitted throughout with black cloth The lights in the room are lowered, the only illumination of any\nbrilliance being a row of candles or lamps, at the side of the stage These are equipped with tin reflectors, so that the light, instead of\nshining on the stage, is projected into the eyes of the audience The\neffect of this is that, whilst any white object can be seen quite plainly\nby the spectators, everything black remains invisible When the performer envelops the young lady’s head in the white\ncloth, he at the same moment throws over her a piece of black\nmaterial of similar size and shape, attached to it by one corner When\nhe removes the white cloth, however, he allows the black cloth to\nremain, thus veiling the head and apparently causing it to disappear Another and larger piece of black material is similarly hidden in the\nfolds of the second white cloth Directly the performer spreads this\nbefore the lady assistant, so that she is hidden from the audience, she\nrapidly pulls off her head-veil, and taking the large black sheet,\nmuffles herself in it up to the neck Consequently only her head\nremains visible In order to disappear entirely, it is only necessary for\nher to replace the head-veil or to pull the larger black cloth up over\nher face The Essential Assistant\nIt is usual when working illusions of this description to have the\nassistance of a third person This assistant must be dressed completely\nin black, with black gloves and a black mask The latter can very\neasily be made from a piece of silk, or any other material that is\nslightly elastic It should be stitched into the form of a cylinder\nsufficiently large to pull over the head Two eyeholes are then cut in\nthe desired position, and the mask is complete (Fig",
    "Two eyeholes are then cut in\nthe desired position, and the mask is complete (Fig 5) 5) Garbed in this somber attire, the assistant is able to move about the\nstage quite freely without being seen by the audience, and to lend\npowerful but invisible aid in accomplishing many first-class\ndeceptions However, this point will be referred to later, and attention\nshould now be turned to the construction of the “black stage” itself Fig 2 —The finished frame Fig 1 illustrates the appearance of the finished stage, and Fig 2\nshows the framework of which it is constructed This framework is\ncomprised of a number of laths fastened together by the method\nshown in Fig 3 A small metal rod—a long nail with the head filed off\nwill suffice—is driven into each upright lath This must be done\ncarefully or the wood will split Next a hole is bored by means of a\ndrill or red-hot poker in each of the laths fitting upon these uprights By placing the hole in each cross lath over the nail in the upright lath,\nas shown in Fig By placing the hole in each cross lath over the nail in the upright lath,\nas shown in Fig 3, the framework can easily be put together or taken\nto pieces, when it is necessary to convey the stage from one point to\nanother Fig 3 —Laths fastened together Fig 4 —Method of joining laths of frame —Method of joining laths of frame Fig 5 —Cloth or silk mask Fig 4 depicts the mode of fixing two laths together lengthwise Instead of having one long lath, it considerably facilitates conveyance\nif two smaller laths are joined by two thumbscrews as shown in Fig 4 A joint of this description is also shown at C, Fig 2 As can be seen by the diagram, the framework is simply a skeleton\nbox; but a little way beyond the center another lath should be carried\nacross at the top (A B, Fig 2) Two curtains of black cloth must be\nobtained and fastened to this lath so that they overlap at the center\n(D, Fig 2) It will now be noticed that this curtain divides the stage into two\nseparate compartments The first of these is the stage proper, upon\nwhich the illusionist performs his various mysteries The second\ncompartment is reserved to provide an exit for the performer and his\nassistants, the flap in the curtains acting as a doorway Some of the\napparatus required for the various illusions may also be kept here\nduring the performance The dimensions of the stage depend entirely, of course, upon the\nsize of the room in which the entertainment is to be given The\n\n\nminimum width, or “length of frontage,” should not be less than ten\nfeet, and the distance from the front of the stage to the beginning of\nthe partition curtain not less than six feet The distance from the\npartition curtain to the back of the stage is not of great importance Provided there is room for the assistant to move about, this is all that\nis required Two and a half feet is ample The following dimensions will be found about as convenient as any;\nbut if the reader is in a position to construct a larger stage, so much\nthe better Frontage, 12 ft ; height, 7 ft 6 in ; distance from front to partition\ncurtain, 7 ft 6 in ; from partition curtain to back of stage, 3 ft Having decided upon the measurements of the stage, a further\nsupply of black cloth must be procured and fitted completely over the\nframework It is preferable to have this cloth already stitched into\nshape (Fig 6), so that it can be simply drawn on over the box-like\nstructure of laths Fig 6 —Cloth covering for frame It is also necessary to spread another piece of black cloth upon the\nfloor Lastly, the stage front must be decorated These decorations consist\nmerely of two curtains hooked at each side of the opening, and a\nfrieze draped along the top lath, as shown in Fig 1 The lighting arrangements must be left largely to the discretion of\nthe reader If he be a “handyman,” he can fit four incandescent gas\nburners to the front of the show A very effective, although primitive,\nmethod of lighting is illustrated by Fig",
    "A very effective, although primitive,\nmethod of lighting is illustrated by Fig 7 Two pieces of wire are\nhooked to the top lath, a pair at each side, and three small bull’s-eye\nlanterns fastened at intervals to them (see diagram) Fig 7 —Method of lighting Fig 8 —Another method of lighting Yet another method is depicted in Fig 8 About half-a-dozen holes\nare bored in a piece of gas-piping, which is stopped at one end Ordinary burners are screwed into these holes and tin reflectors\nattached The whole arrangement is then bound securely to the top\nlath after the framework has been fitted together It is then necessary\nonly to fix a length of gas-tubing from the open end of the pipe to the\nnearest gas-fitting If the reader decides upon the latter method of\nillumination, his best course will be to go to a plumber and place the\njob entirely in his hands The chief thing to bear in mind is, that no light must shine into the\nstage, the only illumination being projected into the eyes of the\nspectators, thus dazzling their vision as much as possible The stage described can, of course, be greatly improved upon The\nabove description is intended simply as a rough guide for the boy\nwhose skill in carpentry does not extend much beyond knocking a nail\nor tin-tack properly into a piece of wood, which, by the way, is not\nsuch an easy task as most people imagine Having constructed a stage suitable for working purposes, we may\nproceed with another illusion The Floating Barrel\nThe performer, who, as previously stated, should be dressed as a\nChinaman, or in a white costume of some description, stands alone in\nfull view of his audience Presently he makes a beckoning motion, and\na large white barrel floats slowly into view To the amazement of the\nspectators, it drops gently to the ground at the magician’s feet He then turns to the other side of the stage and repeats the\nbeckoning motion Immediately a second barrel makes its appearance,\nand deposits itself on the ground a short distance from the first Turning to the audience the performer borrows a dozen or so rings,\nchains, and other trinkets Walking back to the stage, he holds the\nborrowed trinkets above the mouth of one barrel, and clearly drops\nthe mass of jewelry into it The next moment, without a second’s\npause, the illusionist seizes the barrel and turns it upside down Nothing falls out It is perfectly empty Thereupon he darts to the other barrel, turns it over, and out\nshower the trinkets The performer replaces them, and immediately overturns that barrel\nas he did the first But once again the jewelry is found to have\ndisappeared Nor can it be discovered in the other barrel",
    "Nor can it be discovered in the other barrel Retreating to one side of the stage, however, the illusionist waves\nhis hands There is a slight flash, and a small Japanese table is seen\nstanding in the center of the stage, with the trinkets heaped upon it This is a very effective illusion, but it can be even improved upon,\nas the reader will see when he has read the following simple\nexplanation of the trick Its success lies almost entirely with the “black” assistant previously\nreferred to The “floating” barrels are simply carried in by this\nassistant, who must take care to hold them in such a manner that his\nblack-gloved hands do not show up against the white wood Whilst the performer is collecting the articles of jewelry the\nassistant holds a small bag or sack in the mouth of the barrel Consequently, when the performer drops the trinkets into the barrel,\nthey in reality enter the sack, when it is a simple thing for the\nassistant to transfer them to the second barrel—the black bag\nrendering them invisible during transit Immediately the performer appears to deposit the trinkets in the\nbarrel for the second time, the assistant again secures them in his\nsmall sack This time, however, he carries them to the side of the\nstage, where a Japanese table has been placed in readiness out of\nsight of the audience This table is draped with black cloth, which, as\nalready explained, makes it invisible The assistant merely lifts up this\ncloth and empties the trinkets from the sack on to the table Then,\nreplacing the cloth, he carries the table and its contents to the middle\nof the stage Next he simply whisks away the black cloth when the performer\ngives the signal, and the table, with its small heap of jewelry, stands\nrevealed As previously stated, this illusion can easily be improved upon For\ninstance, the “black” assistant can place a live rabbit in one of the\nbarrels, giving the audience the impression that the jewelry has\nundergone \na \nsomewhat \nextraordinary, \nthough \nunprofitable,\ntransformation The performer should attempt to vary the nature of his\nentertainment as much as possible, and the following illusion could\nvery well occupy the next place upon the programme In obedience to the performer’s command, a large white box or\n\n\nwicker-basket floats on to the stage This, as the reader will have been\nable to gather from the explanation of the previous illusion, is simply\ncarried on by the “black” assistant After having shown that the box or basket—as the case may be—is\nperfectly empty, the illusionist raises it from the stage by placing four\nblocks, one under each corner This is to prove the impossibility of a\n“false bottom” or trap-door being used",
    "This is to prove the impossibility of a\n“false bottom” or trap-door being used A man now walks on to the stage, with a white sheet wrapped\nround him, and looking like a Dervish or bernoused Arab Stepping\ninto the basket, he coils himself up until he is concealed at the\nbottom There is a pause of a few seconds, after which a low groan issues\nfrom the interior of the basket A moment later the sheet is seen to\nshoot up into the air, and collapse in a heap upon the stage Both\nsheet and basket are examined; but their human occupant has\ndisappeared—has vanished, as it were, into thin air The illusionist next throws the sheet back into the basket No\nsooner has he done this than it is seen mysteriously to raise itself on\nend Then for a second time it collapses A moment later, however, a\nsecond disturbance is seen to be in progress inside the basket, and this\ntime the white-robed man rises from it, and steps out upon the stage The secret of this illusion lies in the fact that the “black” assistant\nand white-robed man are one and the same person Directly the assistant has carried the wicker basket in, and whilst\nthe illusionist is showing the audience that it is perfectly empty, he\nslips “behind the scenes,” and, taking off his black mask and gloves,\nhastily arrays himself in the sheet In this guise he again makes his appearance, and steps into the\nbasket No sooner has he snuggled down at the bottom, however, than\nhe quickly throws off the sheet and replaces the gloves and mask Giving vent to a hollow groan, he flings the sheet into the air This for\na moment diverts the attention of the spectators, and gives the\nassistant time to step from the basket, behind which he remains in\nreadiness to continue with the second part of the illusion In his black\nclothes he will, of course, be quite unseen When the performer puts the sheet back into the basket, the\nassistant merely stoops and slowly lifts it up, until he can step back\ninto the basket under cover of it As he allows the sheet to collapse for the second time, he sinks\ndown with it out of sight He then again removes his black mask and\n\n\ngloves, and envelops his body in the sheet This done, the hard-worked “black” assistant in his Dervish disguise\nhas simply to step from his place of concealment into full view of the\naudience, and the illusion is complete The Vanishing Man\nAnother good effect, which would act as an excellent climax to the\nentertainment, can be brought about as follows:\nThe performer makes his appearance carrying a large white shawl This he spreads upon the ground Taking the shawl by its two top\ncorners, he holds it before him so that he is completely hidden Next he commences slowly to wave the shawl to and fro, to advance\nto the front, and then to retreat to the back of the stage As he is\nadvancing for the second time, however, the shawl is suddenly\ndropped, and—hey, presto —there is nothing behind it; the illusionist\nhas gone But at the very moment the shawl collapses, a loud shout is heard,\nand the illusionist is seen standing to the rear of the audience In this illusion, as in the others, the “black” assistant plays an\nimportant part His task is not nearly so difficult, however, as those he\nhas already been called upon to undertake In fact, the whole illusion,\nalthough it can be made one of the most effective on the programme,\nis the easiest to accomplish Directly the illusionist picks up the shawl and holds it before him,\nthe “black” assistant steps up and takes it Still under cover of the\nshawl, the two slowly retreat to the back of the stage until they come\nto the opening in the partition-curtain (D, Fig 2) It is then an easy\nmatter for the illusionist to slip through the opening and get clear\naway The assistant continues to wave the shawl slowly backwards\nand forwards, giving the audience the impression that the original\nperformer is still behind it In the meantime the illusionist has made his way out of the room\nby a door in the vicinity of the stage Thence he hurries to a door\nleading to that portion of the room containing the audience Pushing\nthis slightly open so that he may obtain a view of the stage, he waits\nuntil he sees the shawl drop, when he unexpectedly and dramatically\nmakes his presence known The assistant being arrayed in black apparel will, of course, remain\n\n\ninvisible The only drawback to this illusion is, that it necessitates there being\ntwo doors to the room in which the “black stage” is erected Then\nagain, although a room may possess the requisite doors, one of them\nmay be so placed that it is impossible for the performer to reach it\nwithout being first seen by the audience In such a case, however, the\ndifficulty may be overcome by an ordinary screen placed from the\ndoor to the back entrance of the stage As already observed, these illusions can be easily added to and\nimproved upon In fact the “black stage” and its “black” assistant offer\ntremendous scope for a really first-class entertainment, teeming with\nbewildering and mystifying illusions If the stage is large enough, two assistants may be employed, and\nstill more complex effects attempted But having described several\nillusions of an entirely different nature, and having explained the\nprinciple upon which all such illusions are worked, it must be left to\nthe reader to invent other “black stage” mysteries with which to\nentertain and bewilder his friends CHAPTER XXIII\nCONCERNING GHOSTS\nMirror Frauds\nIf the Honorable Society of Stage Ghosts were to choose a motto,\nthey would find few more suitable than the old adage, that “People\nwho live in glass houses should not throw stones ” As the following\nremarks will serve to show, their very existence depends upon a sheet\nof glass, and if this be cracked or broken, farewell to the apparition\nand all its attendant mystery If you look out of the window of a lighted room upon a dark night,\nyou will notice that the pane, instead of being transparent, acts as a\nmirror and reflects the room behind you It is on this principle,\napplied to a stage, that the greater number of ghost effects are\nproduced Owing to the fact that apparitions are usually seen at night,\na good excuse is found for having the stage darkened, whilst the\ngloom serves to conceal several things highly undesirable the\naudience should observe The ghost effect, as seen by the spectators, is somewhat of the\nfollowing description Any person from the audience is requested to\ncome upon the stage and seat himself in a chair already provided He\nhas scarcely taken his seat when a white figure approaches him,\npasses in front, in doing so showing that it is transparent Kneeling by\nhis side, it lays a hand—a ghostly white hand—upon his arm, and\nappears to plead with him in a most touching manner But the\ngentleman from the audience is implacable; he takes no notice\nwhatever of his ghostly supplicant, appearing utterly unconscious of\nits presence Suddenly the object of the ghost’s entreaties becomes clear Fumbling amongst its white robes it produces a ghostly cigar, again\nbegs our friend with most urgent entreaties for a match, and finally,\ndisgusted at his callous indifference, shakes a sepulchral fist at him,\nthrows aside the cumbersome white shrouds, and appears to the\nspectators as a very well-dressed young man in immaculate attire He\nis still a ghost, however, and calmly walks right through the\ngentleman from the audience, lights his ghostly cigar with an equally\n\n\nghostly match, pats his friend condescendingly upon the head, and\nvanishes Unseeing and Disbelieving\n“Ghost What ghost I saw no ghost, but I got very tired sitting up\nthere all that time without anything happening ” So says the\ngentleman from the audience when he returns to his seat, and it is not\nuntil he has seen it all happen to some one else that he will believe\nanything really did occur Fig 1 —Arrangement of stage for ghost-producing He is probably provoked when he finds that the next apparition\ntakes the form of a fascinating young lady who vainly endeavors to\nmake the young man who has taken his place kiss her Indeed, such\nindifference is astounding, and all her pretty wiles and enticements\nare as wasted upon him as though he did not see her As a matter of\nfact he does not know what pleasant temptations surround him In Fig 1 the stage is shown in section, and the phenomenon is\nexplained C, G is the stage, upon which is a chair, H, occupied by the\ngentleman from the audience, I A sheet of plate glass, A, B, rises from\nthe floor of the stage to the flies, and extends from one wing to the\nother This sheet of glass is tilted forward at an angle to be\ndetermined by circumstances Between the footlights, D, and the end\nof the stage, C, is a space or well, to be occupied by the original of the\nghost, K When the curtain is raised, the glass, A, B, is quite invisible to the\nspectators owing to its transparency, and the extinguishing of the\nfootlights at D renders the whole of the stage more or less dark The\nspace, D, G, is also invisible to the spectators, to whom the stage\nappears to present nothing more exceptional than an ordinary chair Mr I, as he may be called, is brought up from the auditorium,\nround by the wings and taken to his chair, whence, looking into the\ntheater before him, he sees nothing of the plate of glass intervening Fig 2 —The coffin trick Being already dressed in the conventional garb of a ghost, the actor,\nK, places himself in the space between D and C, whereupon strong\nlights on the walls, D, E, and C, F, are switched on, throwing their\nglare upon the actor Owing to the principle of reflection mentioned above, the glass, A,\nB, having a fairly dark background, becomes a mirror upon which is\ncast the reflection of the actor K Of course, Mr I in his chair is visible\nthe whole time, but the spectators see in addition to him the reflection\nof K, which naturally appears transparent, and moves about the stage\nexactly as K moves in the space D, C The position of the chair, H, is already known to K, who is\naccordingly able to kneel in his space in such a position that his\nreflection appears kneeling to I, to go through the rest of the\nperformance with perfect ease, and to leave our friend I perfectly\nignorant of what has occurred Returning for a moment to the\nexample of a pane of glass in a lighted room, it must be remembered\nthat the spectators are in the position of the persons within the room\nand see a reflection of what is their own side of the glass, whilst I is\nlike a person outdoors who looks into the room unhindered To him\nthe stage and the audience remain the same throughout the whole\nperformance A Paris Illusion\nAn interesting variation of this scene is produced in Paris at an old\ncafé, known as the “Cabaret du Néant,” in the Montmartre quarter The whole interior of this restaurant is fitted up to appear as funereal\nas possible Guests are served with refreshments upon coffins by\nwaiters dressed as mourners, whilst the walls are covered with notices\nand advertisements of a similarly doleful character Upon payment of a small fee the guests are taken into a cellar,\ncompletely dark except for a small glimmer at the farther end Having\nseated themselves they observe this light slowly increase until it is\nsufficient to disclose an open coffin standing upright Some person from the audience is then requested to accompany one\nof the attendants upon the stage, where he is asked to stand upright in\nthe coffin His friends and the remainder of the spectators are then\ninformed in sepulchral tones that they are about to witness a change\n\n\nwhich it will some day be the lot of every one to undergo, being at the\nsame time reassured that the subject of the experiment will suffer no\nharm from what is taking place A white cloth, stretching from the chin to the heels, is then tucked\nround the figure in the coffin, and after a few moments the living face\ngradually fades away and a skull is seen in its place, whilst a skeleton\nnow fills the coffin (Fig 2)",
    "2) This in its turn fades away, giving place\nonce more to the original living occupant, who soon descends from\nthe stage and expresses himself much surprised at what his friends\ndescribe, as he himself has seen nothing of the ghastly change As in the former experiment, a large sheet of plate-glass is\ninterposed between the audience and the rear of the stage where\nstands the coffin This plate of glass is placed diagonally, as can be\nseen in the plan, Fig This plate of glass is placed diagonally, as can be\nseen in the plan, Fig 3 The coffin, C, is lighted by several electric\nlamps when the man takes his place in full view of the audience At D\nis another coffin in the wings, invisible to the man at C, as also to the\nspectators When the white cloth has been wrapped around the living\nperson, the lights are slowly switched off at C and on at D, with the\nresult that the skeleton in the latter coffin is reflected in the glass, A,\nB, in such a manner that it appears to be actually within the coffin, C To bring the man back to life the operation is reversed Fig 3 —Plan explaining coffin trick The object of wrapping the white cloth about the living person is\nsimply to hide any difference in size between him and the skeleton in\nD Both coffins have, of course, been properly arranged to suit the\nreflections before the commencement of the experiment The Sea Nymph\nThe Sea Nymph, shown in Fig 4, is really a beautiful illusion The\nscenery represents a rolling sea beneath an azure sky, flecked here\nand there with skimming clouds Suddenly from out the waves a\ngraceful form is seen to appear, and, rising steadily, gambol in the\nbillows Circling in the air, she plunges down into the waves, only to\nreappear once more, and repeat her charming sport The sheet of glass is arranged for this performance as in the case of\n\n\nthe ghost, Fig 1 The scenery, A, B, Fig 5, is painted as described, to\nrepresent the sea, and at L and M are placed additional waves, close\nto the footlights The glass, H, K, descends diagonally D, E is a large\ncircular disc revolving upon an axle, F, which is connected by a rope\nor wire to a barrel and handle, G At C and M strong lights are thrown\nupon this disc Fig 4 —The sea nymph The young lady who performs the part of the nymph is suitably\nattired, and takes her place, lying upon the disc, D, E At the proper\ntime the lights are thrown upon the disc, with the result that the\nspectators see her reflection in the glass, H, K, as though she were\nreally standing upright amongst the scenery on A, B By turning the\nhandle at G, the disc is made to revolve, carrying with it the\nrecumbent nymph, who now appears to be turning elegant\nsomersaults amongst the waves Fig 5 —Plan explaining sea-nymph illusion The only difficulty about presenting any of these effects at home is\nthe inconvenience of obtaining and handling so large a sheet of plate\nglass as is necessary A good ghost effect can be easily produced,\nhowever, in a room with a large French window The window must be fastened open at an angle that will have to be\nascertained by experiment The room should then be thrown into\ncomplete darkness The ghost takes his place outside the window and\nagainst the wall, D, F (Fig 6), with two lamps, B, so arranged as to\ncast their light upon him These lamps should be shaded in such a\nway that they cast no glare except upon the figure of the ghost Fig 6 —Plan of room for ghost illusions What happens is very plain The open window, G, C, reflects the\n\n\nshrouded figure of the ghost at A, making it appear to stand in the\ndoorway, pointing ominously at some startled person sitting in the\ndark room It may be added that it is but fair to inform the spectators\nof what is about to take place, as many people are alarmed at\napparitions, and have nerves too weak to stand the sudden\nappearance of a ghost CHAPTER XXIV\nSOME STAGE ILLUSIONS\nFor Home Presentation\nAlthough from earliest times wizards and conjurers have\nattempted to create illusions to impose upon the more credulous of\ntheir dupes, it was not until the great Robert Houdin devoted his\nattention to the matter that any real progress was made in the art Yet\nsuch was the genius of Houdin that his inventions have hardly been\nsuperseded in the many years which have elapsed since his death,\nwhilst in the greater number of cases his original plans have barely\nbeen improved upon",
    "Yet\nsuch was the genius of Houdin that his inventions have hardly been\nsuperseded in the many years which have elapsed since his death,\nwhilst in the greater number of cases his original plans have barely\nbeen improved upon Fig 1 —The principle of reflection Having dealt with the subject of stage apparitions in the previous\nchapter, it is the intention here to describe and explain the best\nillusions in so simple a manner that, with the minimum of trouble,\nany amateur can construct the apparatus necessary for their\nproduction The successful working of the performance depends\nentirely upon the skill of the exhibitors A great number of stage illusions are based upon the principle that\na person looking into a mirror from any angle sees the reflection of\nobjects at a similar angle from the opposite direction This is borne\nout by Fig This is borne\nout by Fig 1 Supposing A, B to be the mirror, with the spectator\nstanding at D, he will see the reflection of an object at E, the angle D,\nF, B being equal to the angle E, F, A A simple adaptation of this principle is seen in\nThe Magic Cupboard\nThis is a large cupboard, of sufficient height to hold a man\ncomfortably, and about 4 feet wide by 21⁄2 feet deep (Fig 2) The\ndoors should be double, and meet at the center post H The cupboard\n\n\ncan be lined with some simple paper of an unobtrusive pattern, and\nthe doors should close easily and securely",
    "The cupboard\n\n\ncan be lined with some simple paper of an unobtrusive pattern, and\nthe doors should close easily and securely Now to describe the performance as it appears to the audience Fig 2 —The magic cupboard Fig 3 —Plan of magic cupboard The cupboard is opened, and anybody allowed to mount the stage\nand see for himself that there is no false bottom or trap in the floor When he is perfectly satisfied and has returned to his seat, the\nmagician introduces his assistant At a nod from him she enters the\ncupboard, which is then closed The wizard makes a few mystic passes\nwith his wand, utters the words “Imshi Imshi ” meaning in Arabic,\n“Depart Depart ” The cupboard is then opened and—found to be\nempty Once more the doors are closed The magician reverses his passes,\nclaps his hands, looks upward, and again opens the doors The pretty\nyoung lady stands inside, smiling radiantly The mystery is understandable by a glance at Fig 3 At E and F are\nhinged two mirrors, identical in size with the walls of the cupboard When opened inwards these mirrors meet at the post, H, which serves\nto conceal the line of their meeting Now the whole deception lies in the walls of the cupboard When\ninspected by the audience the two mirrors were flush against their\nrespective sides, and, having their backs covered with the same paper\nused to line the whole interior of the cupboard, they were mistaken\nfor the real walls against which they were pressed But when the\nmirrors are opened inwards the spectator can see only the reflection\nof the actual walls cast upon the mirrors in such a way that he\nimagines he sees the back of the cupboard Of course this is really\nhidden from him by the opened mirrors, but they reflect the paper-\nlined walls so accurately that a discovery of the deception is\nimpossible When the lady is introduced into the cupboard the mirrors stand\nflat against the sides of the box, which is really empty, but as soon as\n\n\nthe magician closes the outer doors upon his assistant, she pulls out\nthe sides, shuts herself into the triangle E, H, F, and awaits the\nopening of the cupboard When this takes place the mirrors are, of\ncourse, in the position indicated by Fig",
    "When this takes place the mirrors are, of\ncourse, in the position indicated by Fig 3 The spectators, seeing in\nthem the reflection of the walls, think they see the back E, F, and\nthereby conclude that the box is empty This process is reversed when\nthe lady makes her reappearance Fig 4 —The Mandarin’s head It need scarcely be said that the object of the wizard’s passes and\nincantations is to give the assistant time to open and close the mirrors,\nas the case may be Care must be taken when making such a cupboard that the mirrors\nshall be flush with the sides at every point, and that when drawn out\nthey meet at an angle of 45° from the walls This is imperative in\norder that they shall reflect the actual walls of the cupboard exactly The illusion known as\nThe Mandarin’s Head\nis arranged upon a principle somewhat similar to the foregoing To the spectators the effect is this A box, standing upon a simple\ncard-table, is opened and seen to contain a human skull Remarking\nthat he will call up the original owner of the skull, the wizard closes\nthe box, mutters a few incantations, reopens it, and displays a living\nhuman head as shown in Fig 4 This head laughs, speaks, and nods, and in numberless other ways\nshows itself to be no mere imitation The box having been closed\nagain, the incantations are reversed, and on the casket being opened\nonce more the skull is found inside as at first The secret of this remarkable illusion requires but little explanation In the first place, the table has a hole in its top sufficiently large to\nallow of the passage of a human head The hole is closed by a trap\nfrom below, after the manner shown in Fig 5, which may be\ndescribed in detail thus: A, B, C, D is the table, and E the lid filling the\ncircular hole This lid is hinged by G to the table, whilst a bolt, F,\nrunning through the loops I, I in the table and H, H in the lid, secures\nthe latter in its place Upon drawing this bolt the lid opens\ndownwards As a matter of fact, the simple card-table is not so innocent as it\nlooks Indeed, the spectators do not really see under the table at all The surrounding screen is reflected in a couple of mirrors shown in\nFig 6 Let A, B, C, D be the four legs of the table, and A, E, D, E two\nmirrors placed in the form of a V between them, and reaching from\nthe table top to the floor The result of this arrangement is that the two front legs, B, C, are\n\n\nreflected in the mirrors in such a way as to appear to the spectators to\nbe the back legs, A, D, whilst, as in the former experiment, the\nreflections of the walls G, H, F, K, appear to be the actual back F, G, of\nthe screen Fig 5 —Base of table Fig 6 —Plan of screen and table When the magician first opens the box the lid of the table is closed,\nand a skull, imitation or otherwise, rests upon it But no sooner does\nhe close the box than the lid is let down by a confederate, concealed\nin the space A, E, D, and the skull removed by him This confederate, who has already been properly prepared,\nprotrudes his face through the hole, and, when the box is opened, acts\nhis part to life When the box is closed he removes his head from the\nhole in the table, replaces the skull on the lid, and the trick is done The arrangement of mirrors has all along concealed his body,\nwhilst, as already explained, the audience has been deceived into\nthinking they can see beneath the table The wizard must take great care to make all his approaches to the\ntable directly from the front, as, should the reflection of his legs\nappear in the mirrors, the “game would be all up ”\nAn illusion known as\n“The Head of Mary Queen of Scots”\nis worked almost in the same manner The effect of the trick is shown in Fig 7, where the head of the\nunfortunate Queen is seen resting upon the hafts of two axes laid over\nthe arms of a chair Fig 7 —The Queen Mary illusion Fig 8 —The Queen Mary illusion It need scarcely be said that the whole trick lies in the construction\nof the chair, illustrated by Figs 7 and 8",
    "7 and 8 The peculiarity about the\nchair is that the back only reaches down to the spot where the arms\njoin it, thus leaving a space behind the seat This space is concealed\nfrom view by a slanting mirror, the bottom of which rests on the seat,\nwhilst the top comes between the arms of the chair This mirror must\nincline at an angle of 45° from the seat The haft of one of the axes laid across the chair arms serves to\nconceal the upper edge of the mirror, so that when a head is thrust\nupwards, it has the appearance of resting upon the ax handle In the curtain against which the chair is placed there must be a hole\nexactly corresponding to the empty space in the back of the chair Now, through this hole a girl, whose face and hair have already\nbeen made up to look like that of the murdered Queen of Scots,\nthrusts her body just far enough to allow the head to appear above the\nedge of the mirror Owing to the angle at which it is placed the mirror\nreflects the seat of the chair in such a way that it appears to be the\nmissing portion of the back The spectators see nothing of the girl’s\nbody; all that is presented to their horrified gaze is the trunkless head\nof the beautiful but unfortunate Queen Fig 9 —When three are a crowd When Three are a Crowd\nMost people know the old saying, “Two are company, three are a\ncrowd,” and a glance at the illustration shows this may really be true If three persons stand in a prism-shaped arrangement of mirrors, as\nindicated in plan in Fig 9, an innumerable series of reflections would\nappear and the three would in reality become a crowd The Floating Lady\nA most interesting illusion is that of The Floating Lady, which,\nperhaps, should first be described from the point of view of the\naudience Fig 10 —The floating lady The magician appears upon the stage leading by the hand a fairy-\nlike lady Introducing her to the spectators as Mademoiselle Volatile,\nhe describes her susceptibility to his powers of mesmerism, in proof of\nwhich he offers to keep her suspended in the air for any length of\ntime Mlle Volatile accordingly lies upon a board supported by two\ntrestles or chairs of the same height Next the wizard walks round her,\ncarefully disposing of her drapery and tucking it neatly about her feet He makes a few mesmeric passes, examines her pulse carefully, and\nremoves the trestles The lady is seen suspended in the air as in Fig",
    "The lady is seen suspended in the air as in Fig 10 After a short time the magician reverses his passes, and smilingly\nhelps Mademoiselle to the ground All this is very mysterious until Fig 11 “gives the show away ”\nFig 11 —Key to floating lady illusion A, B represents the back of the scenery through which a hole, E, is\nbored This hole is concealed by a little drapery on the face of the\ncurtain Behind the scenes is a simple contrivance, the principle of\nwhich can be seen from the cut It consists of a strong upright F,\nwhich branches into two arms, each of which terminates in a journal,\nH, H Through these journals runs an iron bar, D, which, terminating\nat one end in the handle, G, has the other end protruding through the\nhole in the scenery In the board, C, upon which the lady lies, is a socket to receive the\nend of the handle Now, whilst the lady is putting herself in position on the board, the\nmagician can walk right round her, for the bar has not yet been\nprotruded through the scenery But, at a signal from him, an assistant\nbehind the curtain seizes the handle, G, thrusts the bar through the\nhole as far as it will go, and holds the handle firmly Whilst adjusting the lady’s robe the magician fits his end of the bar\ninto the socket in the board, and, still arranging the folds of her\ndrapery, carefully conceals any sign of what he has done Having\nascertained that everything is safe, he removes the trestles, and the\nboard, with its living burden, is maintained in the air by the iron bar After replacing the supports the bolt is withdrawn by the assistant\nbehind the scenes, and no one suspects the existence of the very\nmaterial support which has kept the lady in the air",
    "After replacing the supports the bolt is withdrawn by the assistant\nbehind the scenes, and no one suspects the existence of the very\nmaterial support which has kept the lady in the air Houdin’s Mesmerism\nRobert Houdin used to exhibit to large audiences with startling\nsuccess the following example of his mesmeric powers For the sake of\nclearness, let it be supposed that the magician and Mademoiselle\nVolatile are performing the trick After the usual remarks as to his powers of mesmerism, and how\nthey set at nought the laws of gravitation, the magician introduces the\nfair lady, who wears a short skirt for the occasion Taking two sticks, each about five feet long, the wizard requests\nMademoiselle to step upon a stool Placing one of the sticks beneath\neach arm-pit, he then begins the incantation When the mystic words have been pronounced and the correct\npasses made, the magician removes the stool, and Mlle Volatile\nappears suspended between the two sticks One or two more passes\nare made and then the wizard removes the stick from beneath her left\narm, Fig 12, slowly raising her body to a horizontal position, as in\nFig 13, and passing a hoop around her to show there is no hidden\nsupport from behind Having left the lady thus suspended for some time, he lowers her to\nthe perpendicular once more, replacing the stick under her left arm\nand putting the stool beneath her feet She is then awakened from the\ntrance The stick beneath Mademoiselle’s right arm is of special\nconstruction, having a core of iron extending its entire length The\nlower end fits firmly into a socket in the floor, whilst the upper end\nitself contains a socket the use of which is explained later Fig 12 —Houdin’s mesmerism Fig 13 —Houdin’s mesmerism",

    "With a little practice it can\neasily be worked at home, and the following hints will explain the\n\n\nperformance The magician, dressed as Bluebeard, leads Fatima on the stage, and,\nduring the course of a short conversation, discovers that she has been\nprying into matters which had better have been left alone In a fit of\npassion he draws his sword and rushes upon her, whereupon Fatima\nfalls to her knees, crying for mercy Bluebeard is obdurate, but after\nmany tears from his wife he consents that she shall be blindfolded, to\nprevent her being a witness of her own fate He binds a black scarf\nacross her eyes, but has barely finished, when she breaks away, and\nrushes from the stage Bluebeard pursues hotly, and in another moment returns dragging\nthe blindfolded girl after him He puts her into a wicker basket,\nfastens the lid, and with a savage grin, thrusts his sword through and\nthrough the basket, his victim shrieking at every stroke Having worked the spectators to a pitch of agonized excitement, the\nmurderer throws down his sword, unfastens the lid of the basket, and\nstoops to gaze on his sanguinary work The basket is empty The basket is empty Staggering back with a look of horror, he suddenly perceives the\n“slaughtered” Fatima herself appearing from amongst the spectators,\npointing at him accusingly The deception in the trick is twofold Firstly, the basket is of special\nconstruction, and secondly, there are two Fatimas With regard to the basket the solution is shown in Figs 16 and 17",
    "16 and 17 The first illustrates the appearance of the basket when Fatima is thrust\ninside Fig 16 —The Indian basket trick Fig 17 —The Indian basket trick explained The lid, A, B, is plain, and hinged to the top at C, D The back, E, G,\nF, J, is similarly hinged at G, J The top, E, C, F, D, is double, having a\nduplicate, L, K, hinged at E, F Having placed Fatima in the basket, Bluebeard thrusts his sword\nthrough and through the wicker-work, carefully avoiding the spot\nwhere, as he knows, the girl is lying At each stroke she screams\n\n\nlustily, as though the blade were piercing her body Then, deftly pushing down the back of the basket, E, G, F, J (Fig 17), she rolls herself out upon it, drawing after her the false top, E, K,\nby doing which the original back is entirely replaced She is now lying\noutside the basket, which is, of course, empty when opened by\nBluebeard Now comes the question of the two Fatimas The girl who is put\ninto the basket is not the one who was blindfolded by Bluebeard When Fatima rushed away pursued by her murderer her place was\ntaken by another girl waiting behind the scenes similarly dressed and\nof the same height and figure The bandage upon her eyes hid from\nthe spectators any difference in features The substitute having been apparently slain by Bluebeard, the\noriginal Fatima slipped in at the back of the auditorium, slowly\nwalked down amongst the spectators (who recognized her face) and\nconfronted the assassin In the confusion that naturally followed, the\nsubstitute managed to leave her place behind the basket and vanish\nfrom the stage The Disappearing Princess\nThis is an illusion originally produced at one of the French ballets A train of slaves appears, bearing a palanquin, in which reclines a\ndazzlingly beautiful Princess The slaves march slowly round the\nstage, allowing the spectators ample opportunity to inspect the\npalanquin from all sides Suddenly a band of brigands rushes upon the scene, with the\nobvious intention of seizing the lovely Princess Flourishing their\nglittering swords and brandishing all manner of fearsome weapons,\nthey surround the palanquin and its terrified bearers The robber chieftain advances with uncouth flattery, assuring the\nlady that not a hair of her head shall be touched But the only answer\nshe makes is to lower in his face the curtain of the litter Furious at such an insult, the robber stretches out his hand, and\nwith a single touch causes the curtains to fly open The Princess has disappeared Gazing at one another in astonishment, the villains search for the\nvanished lady, but their endeavors proving fruitless, they eventually\ndecide to butcher the slaves and carry off the palanquin as booty At this moment a handsome young Prince springs into view; the\nrobbers, startled at his sudden appearance, take to flight, and abandon\nall thought of their prey In his turn the Prince approaches the palanquin, sees it empty, and\nquestions the slaves, who can only say that their mistress was there,\nbut has disappeared Pulling the curtains aside to see if they offer a\nsolution to the mystery, he releases them almost instantly, and the\nlovely Princess is found reclining upon the litter, smiling so\ncharmingly that the Prince then and there loses his heart Fig 18 —The disappearing Princess The explanation of all this is very simple In Fig 18 the lady is\nsitting upon what appears to be the bottom of the palanquin In\nreality it is a false floor placed upon the real one At each corner are\nattached cords that run up the four columns and are counterpoised by\nheavy weights When drawing the curtains, the Princess releases a catch,\nwhereupon the counterpoise and cords immediately draw her,\ntogether with the false floor upon which she rests, to the roof of the\npalanquin, which has been so painted as to make it appear shallower\nthan it really is By pressing another spring she is enabled to lower\nherself once more, in time to appear before the fortunate and\nadmiring Prince CHAPTER XXV\nTHE ROOM OF MYSTERY\nHow to Make a Haunted House\nOne winter evening three boys—Jim Thompson, his cousin Will\nWhite, and a friend named Handley—approached the door of Bobbie\nCargill’s house Bobbie was a genius for inventions, and they all felt a\ndesire to see his home As they reached the door, White, who was a cynic in his own way,\nraised his hand to the knocker and was about to give a thundering\n“rat-tat,” when the door silently opened, revealing an empty hall in\nwhich the light flickered dimly After a glance of surprise at one another the guests entered “Close the door Wipe your boots, and come upstairs ”\nThe visitors started violently as these words were uttered by a\nhollow voice, coming from nowhere in particular, and yet quite close\nto where they were standing After a moment Handley said in a whisper, “I don’t much like this It seems——”\n“Hang up your hats, and be quick about it,” the ghostly voice\ninterrupted sharply “Are you going to stand chattering there\nthe whole night Hang up your hats, I say ”\nThis was not a pleasant beginning, yet none of the guests cared to\nshow the white feather “Come on ” said White “Let’s see it through”; and setting an\nexample he placed his hat upon the nearest peg",
    "“Let’s see it through”; and setting an\nexample he placed his hat upon the nearest peg Crash Amidst a clatter as of broken glass the hat and peg fell to the\nground The three boys looked at one another in consternation But before they had time to remark on this misfortune, a shriek of\nweird laughter rang in their ears “Ha Ha Ha ” The invisible person\nseemed in paroxysms of mirth at their disaster “I don’t care for this a bit,” muttered Handley; “let’s clear out ”\nThey were all about to beat a hasty retreat when Bobbie Cargill\nappeared, apparently much surprised at finding his visitors making an\nawkward group in the hall “How did you fellows get in,” he said, “and what have you been\ndoing Has there been an accident Has there been an accident Never mind, come along upstairs\nand have a ‘feed’; perhaps you will feel better then ”\nNothing loth, the three guests followed their host to his own room,\nwhich usually went by the name of “The Den ” The upper part of the\nhouse was totally dark, and it was with a feeling of relief that they\nsaw a glimmer of light beneath the door of “The Den ”\n“Step inside and make yourselves at home,” said Cargill “I will just\nrun and say that you have arrived,” and he disappeared into the\ndarkness Followed by the others, White turned the handle and threw the\ndoor open, glad to find a light once more But the pleasure was short-\nlived, for the door had scarcely opened half-way when the light went\nout White, however, strode into the room, and his friends were about to\nfollow, when there was a heavy stumble, a crash, and a smothered\nshout that was instantly drowned in the violent clatter and ringing of\nbells about their very ears “What has happened ” gasped Handley, scarcely able to hear his\nown voice in the deafening clamor Advancing into the darkness, a\nviolent report beneath his feet caused him to leap into the air with\nalarm, whilst in the gloom White was trying to make himself heard\nabove the pandemonium “Here, Cargill, get a light for goodness’ sake ” howled Handley, as\ntheir host appeared “I don’t know what on earth has happened; it\nseemed like a pistol going off ”\n“You fellows are making a fine noise between you,” shouted Cargill “Get inside, Jim, and turn on the light; it’s just to the left ” Jim had no\nsooner stepped across the threshold and begun searching for the\nswitch, than BANG BANG —the very floor seemed thundering\nbeneath him, whilst a rattle as of a thousand pots falling to the\nground made the confusion worse Leaping back hastily, he collided\nwith Handley, and the couple sat down with a ponderous thud “That’s right; make yourselves comfortable ” laughed Bobbie\nCargill As he spoke the light was turned on, the jangling bells ceased,\nand the three guests were discovered gazing ruefully at one another,\nwhilst their host, calm and collected, smiled down on them from the\ndoorway It was some time before Bobbie could pacify his guests Indeed, the\nsituation might have become painfully awkward had they not\n\n\nhappened to glance at the table, which certainly looked inviting Knives and forks glistened cheerfully on a spotless white cloth, whilst\ndainty mats and sparkling cruets promised a really substantial “feed ”\nA large center-piece full of flowers added to the appearance of the\ntable, and showed that Bobbie Cargill knew how to do things “in\nstyle ”\nFollowing their host’s example, the three chums took their seats at\nthe table and glanced round the room It was a cozy “Den,” and\nlooked cheerful, with a sparkling fire on the hearth A thick curtain\nwas drawn across the window at Cargill’s back, lending an air of\ncomfort to the place Before each guest was a napkin, neatly mitered, with a piece of\nbread reposing between the horns, and scarcely noticing what he was\ndoing, White drew this piece of bread from its resting-place A sharp exclamation drew attention to him There he sat, a mass of\nbread-crumbs before him, and a look of surprise on his face “Have you had an accident ” grinned Cargill “Never mind the\ncrumbs, they can soon be scooped up; wait a minute until I fetch the\ntray ”\nHe had scarcely risen when a roar of laughter burst from Jim and\nHandley By some strange means the entire mass of crumbs had been\nswept off the cloth and scattered all over the place “You might have waited for me to clear them away,” grumbled\nBobbie, and this was the beginning of a heated discussion, which\nwould probably have ended violently had not the host turned the\nconversation by asking Jim if he would take a piece of tongue “Yes, please,” answered Jim Sharpening his knife in a business-like manner, Cargill made ready\nto cut a slice",
    "Sharpening his knife in a business-like manner, Cargill made ready\nto cut a slice But at this point a strange thing happened As soon as the knife and\nfork got near the tongue, it leaped from the dish and clung tenderly to\nthe knife For a moment or two it hung suspended, and then flopped\nback into the dish “Let’s have another try,” said Cargill in a puzzled way Up it jumped\nonce more, apparently too anxious to be carved to remain still on the\nplate A murmur of surprise escaped the guests as all eyes were fixed upon\nthis strange behavior Once more the carver thrust his knife near the\ntongue, caught it neatly as it ascended, and carried it away to a side\ntable, where he was obliged to bury his face in a handkerchief,\n\n\npresumably overcome with grief Having recovered somewhat, the host resumed his seat, remarking,\n“I think that tongue is best out of the way I am afraid I have nothing\nbetter to offer you than some potatoes You might help them round,\nHandley ”\nBefore his friend had time to reply, the lid of the tureen arose\nslowly and deliberately—ascended and then remained stationary in\nthe air Only for a moment, however Suddenly rising yet higher it\nwas followed by each individual potato, as one by one they rose\nsedately to the ceiling, leaving but one of their number in the tureen Their eyes fairly bulging with surprise, the boys looked at one\nanother, at their host, and then at the tureen with its solitary\noccupant But this last potato had suddenly awakened to a sense of its\nloneliness, and sprang into the air to join its companions Next the\nwhole party of vegetables slowly crossed the ceiling and disappeared\nbehind the curtain, to be seen no more Jim wanted to jump up and see where they had gone, but his host\ndissuaded him, and, anxious to change the subject, asked what he\nwould have to drink “I don’t quite know What is there ”\nA wine bottle that had been quietly standing in front of White\nlurched suddenly forward, as though in answer to the question At the\nsame moment the table began to heave, the glasses to rattle, and a\nlittle stool, covered with books, toppled over with a prodigious crash “Haven’t you some other room we can go to ” stammered Jim “Nonsense, it is only some silly trick of Cargill,” said White Nevertheless all three guests wished themselves well out of it,\nespecially when the dim light suddenly grew dimmer, and the\nshadows in the room increased In a few seconds the boys were barely\nable to see one another At this point a mournful moan rang through the room, the curtains\nwere seen to open, and a white figure glided from between them and\npassed out through the door “Let’s get out of here, the place is haunted ” cried White, rising\nfrom his chair “Ha Ha Ha ” a ghostly laugh issued from the flowers in the center\nof the table, and was echoed by the clock on the mantelpiece “Ha Ha Ha ”—but the guests could stand it no more, and,\nscrambling and struggling, they rushed downstairs, with White at\ntheir head Panting and scared they did not stop until the hall was\n\n\nreached, when they stood still, staring at one another in dismay “What is the matter ” a sweet voice greeted them The whole party\nturned to find Cargill’s sister standing at the dining-room door,\nlooking from one to the other in frank amazement None of them\ncared to reply It is no pleasant thing to tell a pretty girl that you have\nbeen afraid “The ghost, Dolly,” gasped her brother after a moment, and in a\nshaky voice he recounted their mysterious adventures “So the silly old ghost would not let you have any tea You must all\ncome in here and enjoy yourselves I believe there is plenty to eat,”\nand leading the way Miss Dolly ushered them into the dining-room,\nwhere the table was laid with enough good things to cheer a king But when she had shown each of the four friends his seat there still\nremained a vacant place at the head of the table “Now, gentlemen,” she said with a naughty smile, “as you are all\nfeeling much braver now, I am sure you will not mind if the Ghost sits\ndown and has something to eat, too ”\nThe boys looked at one another and then at her, but Miss Dolly,\ntaking no notice of their surprise, quietly seated herself in the vacant\nchair, passed a plate to White, and\nsaid—\n“Now, Mr White, please give the Ghost something to eat ”\n·········\nAfter they had all had a good tea, of course Bobbie Cargill and his\nsister, the Ghost, had to tell the others how it was done This is the\ngist of what they\nsaid:—\nFig 1 —Apparatus for producing ghostly sounds The opening of the door was a very simple matter A loop was tied\nin one end of a long piece of strong cord or string, which was carried\nacross to the wall by means of staples, to a concealed corner The loop\nwas slipped over the door-catch, so that when the other end was\npulled this catch was drawn back, whilst the continued pull on the\nstring made the door open This loop was made of such a size, that as\nsoon as the door had opened to its full extent the string slipped\nautomatically from the catch, and could then be pulled away and out\nof sight Fig 2 —Mysterious hat-stand In the angle formed by the wainscoting and the floor a piece of\nsimple tubing was placed, one end reaching a room on the ground\nfloor, whilst the other was carried up behind the hat-stand to the\nheight of about five feet To this end a cardboard funnel was fixed, as\nin Fig 1, which, sticking out from the wall, was concealed by a hat or\nscarf upon the rack A similar funnel was placed upon the other end,\nso that the voice of any person speaking through the tube from the\nroom was carried with undiminished force to the hall, thus\ntransmitting the ghostly messages and weird laughter to the guests In most hat-stands the pegs are screwed to the back, and taking\nadvantage of this, Bobbie Cargill had unscrewed those pegs most\nlikely to be used by his visitors, putting “fakes” in their place To all\nappearances there was no difference between the “fakes” and the\nproper pegs, but in reality the former were simply gummed against\nthe rack, just strong enough to bear their own weight, but too weak to\nsupport a hat Fig 3 —Prepared hat-stand peg By the contrivance of a piece of string the fall of the hat-peg was\nmade to work a kind of booby trap, explained by Fig 2, which shows\nthe hat-stand in section The false peg, A, is lightly gummed to the\nstand, B, C, against the hole D, where the real peg is screwed A bent\npin or nail is driven into this end of the peg, as seen in Fig 3, the end\nbending downwards A thin piece of string, F in Fig 2, is fastened\nround this pin with a loop, passed through the hole D, and supports at\nthe other end a tin, G, filled with bits of broken glass, marbles, and\nsuch like Naturally, when White hung his hat on the peg the strain brought\nthe peg away from the stand, in its fall releasing the string and\ncausing the tin to clatter to the floor So simply was the whole thing\narranged, however, that Bobbie Cargill had fixed it up in less time\nthan it has taken to describe The absence of lights in the house served a twofold purpose In the\nfirst place, it made the mystery and eeriness more marked, whilst at\nthe same time it concealed several little matters which had to be\nhidden in order to insure success It will now be necessary to glance at the arrangement of the “Den,”\nshown by Fig 4 The room was entered by the door A, whilst in the\nopposite wall is the fireplace B The window C is hidden by the two\n\n\nheavy curtains at D and E In the center of the room stood the table F,\naround which were placed the chairs G, G, G, G Between the curtains\nand the window stood the ghost, who after all turned out to be none\nother than Dolly Over the center of the table hung the gas, which, being\nincandescent, naturally had a burner with a by-pass, and was easily\nmanipulated by means of a piece of string running up the chandelier,\ncarried across the ceiling where it was painted white, and down to\nMiss Dolly behind the curtains A weight should be fastened to the\nswitch to make it fall when not pulled by the string, as in Fig 5 Fig 4 —Plan of the room of mystery When White opened the door the young lady lowered the gas by\nmeans of her string, and as it was a by-pass the light did not actually\ngo out, although it went sufficiently low to plunge the room in\ndarkness Fig 5 —The weighted by-pass Fig 6 —An exploding cap It was an easy matter to cause a collision between the visitors A\npiece of cord stretched across the room, at L, L, quickly did its work,\nand was then pulled away behind the curtain The “Den” had not been fitted up so neatly for beauty alone, and if\nthey had looked, the guests might have found a couple of strong\nelectric bells concealed beneath the dainty hangings of a picture by\nthe door Dolly had but to push a button and these two bells were set\nringing like an alarm clock, and with a persistence calculated to\narouse the Seven Sleepers Handley’s experience required even less preparation Several good\npercussion caps were placed beneath the carpet and covered with a\npiece of tin as shown in Fig 6",
    "6 In the center of this piece of tin, a hole\nwas pierced with a nail, making ragged edges on the further side These ragged edges were placed over the powder in the cap, with the\n\n\nresult that so soon as Handley trod upon the carpet over the plate the\ncap was exploded with a loud report Meanwhile Bobbie Cargill, arriving under cover of the darkness,\nadded to the uproar by banging a tin can with a heavy stick, and\nperformed this office so lustily that nothing else could be heard It is scarcely necessary to remark that sending Jim into the room to\nturn on the switch was merely a feint to get him out of the way, and\nto plunge him into the fracas A signal from Bobbie was enough to make his sister turn on the\nlight and release the bell pushes, so that when silence was restored,\nand the darkness dispelled, there was nothing to show how all the\ncommotion had occurred By adjusting a screw in the gas-burner Bobbie had previously\narranged matters so that even when the gas was turned full on the\nlight was not very strong Although sufficient to illumine the room, it\nwas feeble enough to hide several tell-tale features Besides being an ornament to the table, the large center-piece of\nflowers served to conceal the end of a piece of tubing which passed\nbeneath Bobbie’s chair to the far side of the curtain Amongst the\nfrilled mats, too, there were one or two other contrivances to be\nexplained in their turn It had been Miss Dolly’s business to make the fake pieces of bread Taking a piece of bread and breaking it up into very small crumbs, she\nhad then added just enough milk to enable her to mold the crumbs\ninto the shape of a piece of bread again, and had then let the\nconcoction dry, when it had become sufficiently brittle to suit her\npurpose Concealed by the mat in the center was a small indiarubber tube,\none end pointed directly to the spot where White had dropped his\nmass of crumbs, whilst the other ended in a bulb conveniently placed\nto Bobbie’s hand He had nothing to do, therefore, but to press the\nbulb suddenly, and laugh as the wind thus caused sent the crumbs\nflying A Deceitful Member\nThe tongue is proverbially a deceitful member, and the one lying\nbefore Bobbie Cargill was no exception to the rule Indeed, except for\nits appearance there was really very little tongue about it It consisted\n\n\nof a round tin, in which had been placed a small bar of highly\nmagnetized iron By fixing a slice of real tongue to the top of the tin,\nand disguising the sides in a similar manner, Bobbie had made such a\ngood resemblance to the real thing, that it would have been hard to\ndiscover the deception in the subdued light of the “Den ”\nIt is very easy to see what happened So soon as the steel knife\napproached the dish, the magnet within the faked tongue made the\nlatter leap up to meet the knife and cling to it Of course, when the\nfork was plunged through the thin outer coating of meat it struck the\ntin, making it crack in a strange manner In Fig 7 is shown the\nmethod of fixing the magnet, the whole faked tongue being shown in\nsection A number of experiments had to be undertaken before the\ntrick could be made to work satisfactorily, but in the end Bobbie was\nquite pleased with the result of his labors",
    "A number of experiments had to be undertaken before the\ntrick could be made to work satisfactorily, but in the end Bobbie was\nquite pleased with the result of his labors Fig 7 —The mysterious tongue The whole success of the potato trick depended upon Dolly, who\nworked the simple apparatus to perfection Attached to the handle of\nthe lid was a strong piece of wire, which the half-light rendered\ninvisible This passed through a loop in the ceiling and over to the\ncurtain, to enable that young lady to pull A second wire was attached\nto it that pulled the cover and the potatoes out of sight Fig 8 will\nshow how this was arranged A ring C is put in the ceiling A B over\nthe tureen From the lid E a wire D passes up through this ring and\nalong the ceiling to the back of the curtain G Upon the wire D a ring\nH is threaded, whilst attached to this ring is another length of wire F,\nthat also passes behind the curtain By pulling the wire D the lid of the tureen is naturally raised to the\nceiling at C When it has reached the top, it is only necessary to pull\nthe wire F, and pay out the wire D, to make the whole lid travel\ntowards G Each of the potatoes had been previously attached to the\nlid by a wire about ten inches long, with the exception of the small\none that remained in the dish, which had a separate arrangement of\nthread, similar to that of the lid, all to itself The movement of the bottle upon the table was caused by the\ninflation of a little india-rubber bulb beneath the cloth, and worked\nby the host as he sat at the table Fig 8 —The disappearing potatoes The excitement of his guests having been thus aroused it was a very\nsimple matter for Bobby Cargill to move the table with his knees,\nwhilst by dexterously pulling a string Dolly was able to overturn the\nlittle table laden with books (Fig",
    "The excitement of his guests having been thus aroused it was a very\nsimple matter for Bobby Cargill to move the table with his knees,\nwhilst by dexterously pulling a string Dolly was able to overturn the\nlittle table laden with books (Fig 4, H) To add to all this confusion\nDolly then began slowly to lower the light, tap the wall by her side,\nand utter dismal groans She then clothed herself in a white sheet,\nopened the curtains, and made her way out of the room with all haste Little wonder that general consternation ensued It only remains to be mentioned that the speaking tube concealed\namongst the flowers in the center-piece was sufficient to carry the\nlaughter from one of the servants, who, acting under instructions,\nstood without the room It proved the climax, and peace was scarcely\n\n\nrestored until they were all sitting below with the Ghost herself, and\npartaking of a real supper without any faked tongue As they all agreed, it was not a bad scare for the money, as a very\nsmall sum represented the entire outlay for working The Mysterious\nRoom CHAPTER XXVI\nMECHANICAL SECOND-SIGHT\nApproaching the Supernatural\nAn exhibition of so-called hypnotism and second-sight is a favorite\nitem in the programmes of many professional entertainers If well\nmanaged, the performance appears miraculous, and is sure to impress\nthe majority of the audience as savoring strongly of the supernatural The exhibition is usually somewhat of the following nature A young lady is presented to the audience as being possessed of the\nmarvelous faculty of second-sight, so keenly developed that she is able\nto see and describe whatever falls under the observation of her\ndouble Needless to say, this individual is the performer who\nintroduces her Having given this explanation, Prof B, as he may be\ncalled, bandages the eyes of the gifted young lady, Mlle C, and seats\nher on the stage in full view of the spectators The Professor now walks amongst his audience and asks some\nperson to whisper a number This having been done, he calls out to\nMlle C, desiring her to state this whispered number, which she cannot\npossibly have heard Without the least hesitation Mlle answers\ncorrectly The Professor will perhaps now ask for a coin, and at his request\nshe will describe it accurately, give its date and value, and any other\nparticulars desired In the same way she will give the number of a\nbank-note, describe any article the Professor may happen to be\nholding in his hand, or even tell to what he is pointing With many other tricks as wonderful and mysterious does the\nProfessor attempt to beguile the audience into a belief in his occult\npowers It may be very uncharitable to give the Professor’s deceptions\naway, but that is what this chapter will do for the benefit of its\nreaders The whole secret lies in a private code understandable only by the\ntwo performers By using this Prof B tells his accomplice exactly what\nshe has to answer, gives her the numbers and describes the objects,\nquite unknown to his listeners All that is necessary is a good memory\nand quick hearing Given these essentials, the rest is simple Let us begin by describing the code with which the Professor\napprises Mlle C of the various numbers chosen by the audience The units are expressed by letters from which Prof B forms\nsentences when addressing Mlle C A very commonly used code is\nthis:—\n1 is represented by t\n2\n„\n„\nn\n3\n„\n„\nm\n4\n„\n„\nr\n5\n„\n„\nl\n6\n„\n„\nh\n7\n„\n„\nk, g, or c\n8\n„\n„\nf, v, or w\n9\n„\n„\np or b\n0\n„\n„\ns or z\nTo use this code properly two things are necessary Mlle C must\nknow how many figures the number consists of, and she must also\nknow when the code is finished The latter point is easily settled When she hears the words, “if you\nplease,” she knows that whatever follows has no code meaning\nwhatever, whilst everything that precedes these words carries a\nhidden meaning By the use of the following words the number of figures is conveyed\nin a perfectly unmistakable manner For  one\nfigure  use the word figure „ \ntwo\nfigures\n„\n„\nnumber „ \nthree\n„\n„\n„\nvery well „ \nfour\n„\n„\n„\nvery well, sir (Mlle or madam)",
    "or madam) „ \nfive\n„\n„\n„\nvery good „ \nsix\n„\n„\n„\nvery good, sir (or madam) The following explanation shows how to put this into practice Taking all the numbers successively from one to ten (a thing that\n\n\nwould never be done in an ordinary way), Prof B conveys to his fair\nfriend the desired information by means of the sentences subjoined Prof — Tell this figure (t = 1; “figure” = one number )\n„\n  Now, what is this figure (n = 2 )\n„\n  Might I ask this figure (m = 3 )\n„\n  Repeat this figure (r = 4 )\n„\n  Let me know this figure (l = 5 )\n„\n  Have you understood (h = 6 )\n„\n  Give me this figure (g = 7 )\n„\n  Will you repeat this (w = 8 )\n„\n  Please tell me this figure (p = 9 )\nProf —This seems an easy number (t = 1, s = 0; “number” means\ntwo figures Ans 10 )\nProf —Now, please, tell this number (n = 2, p = 9; word\n“number” means two figures (n = 2, p = 9; word\n“number” means two figures Ans 29 )\nProf —Very well, let me know this (“Very well” means three\nfigures; l = 5, m = 3, k = 7 Ans 537 )\nProf —Very good, Mlle Now repeat clearly what this is, if you\nplease (“Very good, Mlle ,” means six figures; n = 2, r = 4, c = 7, w\n= 8, t = 1, s = 0 Ans 247810 )\nSometimes the Professor asks some person present to come upon\nthe stage, and write certain figures upon a blackboard provided for\nthe purpose The method of communicating the numbers is the same,\nbut the Professor in this instance points to each figure in turn, tells it\nto the lady, and awaits her reply before proceeding For example,\nsuppose the number 638219 to have been written by a gentleman Prof —Very good, sir (turning to Mlle C) How many figures have\nbeen written upon the board Mlle —Six Prof (pointing to first figure)—How about this (h = 6 )\nMlle —Six Prof —May I ask this (m = 3 )\nMlle —Three Prof —Well (w = 8 )\nMlle —Eight Prof —Now, if you please (n = 2 )\nMlle —Two Prof —This (t = 1 )\nMlle —One Prof —Please (p = 9 )\nMlle —Nine Prof —That is all right (This is invariably understood to mean that\nthe experiment is completed )\nShould any smart person write a number like 99999, and smile\nexpectantly, awaiting the Professor’s confusion, he will be doomed to\ndisappointment, for Prof B merely says to him “Very good”: and\nturning to Mlle C, says “Please,” and she answers immediately,\n“There are five nines ” Of course the Professor’s “very good” has told\nher that there are five figures, and the “please” has told her that they\nbegin with nine Finding that the Professor does not say anything\nmore, she presumes they are all the same, and replies accordingly This system of coding is applied in a similar manner to the letters of\nthe alphabet, and by this means any word can be easily spelled But to\navoid detection, the letters have to be transposed somewhat after the\nfollowing fashion, which must only be considered as an example,\nbeing too easy of detection for practical use A  becomes  B\nB\n„\nC\nC\n„\nD\nD\n„\nE\nE\n„\nF\nF\n„\nG\nG\n„\nH\nH\n„\nI\nI\n„\nJ\nJ\n„\nK\nK\n„\nL\nL\n„\nM\nM\n„\nN\nN\n„\nO\n\n\nO\n„\nP\np\n„\nQ\nQ\n„\nR\nR\n„\nS\nS\n„\nT\nT\n„\nU\nU\n„\nV\nV\n„\nW\nW\n„\nA\nX\n„\n“now”\nY\n„\n“easy”\nZ\n„\n“plain”\nTo show how this is used, it may be supposed that the Professor has\nin his hand a brown cap, which some little boy in the audience has\ngiven him “Do be quick, if you please, and tell me what I have in my hand ”\n(d = c, b = a, q = p )\n“A cap,” answers Mlle C “Come, say precisely, if you please, what color ” (c = b, s = r, p =\no )\n“It is a brown cap,” answers she This system can be simplified yet further by coding the various\nobjects most likely to be required, in a way similar to the\nfollowing:—\nTouch = part of clothing Look at = part of the room Point = part of figure Oh yes = letter or piece of paper Most certainly = coin, other than money Yes, if you like = a watch This is harder = some trinket I am afraid this is harder = a ring An excellent idea = a playing card As an example of how this code can be employed, it may be\n\n\nimagined that the Professor lays his hand casually upon a gentleman’s\ncoat-sleeve Prof —What am I touching Mlle —A part of some one’s clothing Prof —Tell me fully what, if you please (t = s, m = l, f = e, w =\nv; which reads “sleeve ”)\nMlle —I can dimly see a sleeve Prof —Have you found only a sleeve (h = g, f = e, o = n; reading\n“gent ”)\nMlle —Yes, I see a gentleman’s sleeve Or as another example, imagine that some one produces a seal Prof (loud enough for Mlle C to hear)—This is harder This fairly\nbothers me (looking at it closely) Mlle",
    "Mlle (who has understood “This is harder” to mean a trinket, and\n“this fairly bothers me” to read Seal)—I can see quite plainly that it is\na seal Prof —Both initials, if you please Mlle —A, and then H Prof —Hurry up, if you please What metal is it made of Mlle —It is made of gold This last answer is based upon another code for the various metals,\nwhich may be something like\nthis:—\nBrass\n is represented by  T\nCopper\n„\n„ C\nSilver\n„\n„ D\nGold\n„\n„ H\nIron\n„\n„ J\nTin\n„\n„ M\nSome person in the audience hands the Professor a silver cigarette\ncase, and, looking up to the stage, he\nremarks—\n“This is harder Come, perfectly, now ” (c = b, p = o, now = x )\n“I see a box,” murmurs Mlle C dreamily “Describe it ” (d = silver )\n“It is made of silver ”\n\n\n“Do just have something further, if you please ” (d = c, j = i, h =\ng, s = r, f = e—making “cigre ”)\n“It looks like a cigarette box—a cigarette case ”\n“Let us know the number of cigarettes in it ” (l = 5 )\n“There are five cigarettes ”\n“Well, just say, if you please, what kind ” (w = v, j = i, s = r )\n“They are cigarettes of Virginia tobacco ”\nMoney should be designated by N, which, as you remember, is the\ncode letter for M The following will then come in\nhandy:—\nGold is coded as 1, silver as 2, copper as 3, and paper as 4 “Now, if you please, tell me what I have in my hand ”\n“I see money ”\n“Nature ” (n = 2 = silver )\n“Silver ”\n“Let’s see, if you please, how you would describe this coin ” (l = 5,\ns = 0 )\n“I see a fifty-cent piece ”\n“The piece seems new ” (t = 1, p = 9, s = 0, n = 2 )\n“The date is 1902 ”\nHolding out a handful of money, containing say, a five-dollar gold\npiece, two fifty-cent pieces, four quarters, and five cents in copper,\nThe Professor says, “Tell this, if you please, the number of coins in\nmy hand ” (t = 1, t = 1 )\n“Eleven,” answers Mlle C “True Now, Mademoiselle, if you please, tell me the nature of it ”\n(t = 1 = gold, n = 2 = silver, m = 3 = copper )\n“Gold, silver, and copper ”\n“Leaving, if you please, the others, let us start with the gold ”\n“A five-dollar gold piece ”\n“Now, if you please, silver ”\n“I see two dollars in silver ”\n“Likewise, if you please, the copper ”\n“Five cents ”\n“All right ”\nThe code for playing cards should be formed in much the same way The following is a suggestion of what might be\narranged:—\nThe cards, commencing with the ace and finishing with the king,\n\n\nshould be numbered one to thirteen inclusive The suits can then be\ndistinguished\nthus:—\nGood = hearts; very good = diamonds; well = clubs; very well =\nspades Supposing that the Professor has handed a pack of cards to some\nperson among the spectators, who has drawn the knave of clubs “Very well, sir,” says the Professor “There tell, if you please, what\ncard this is ” (Very well = clubs, there tell = eleven, i e the knave )\n“You are holding the knave of clubs in your hand,” replies Mlle C “Good Look, if you please, and tell what this is ”\n“The five of hearts ”\n“Very good, Mademoiselle Tell me, if you please, what this card\nis ”\n“The king of diamonds ”\n“Well, this ”\n“The ace of spades ”\nAt this point it is not an uncommon thing for some skeptical person\npresent to take a card and demand to know its value without having\nshown it to the Professor The latter rises to the occasion immediately He explains that Mademoiselle can only see what he actually sees\nhimself, her sight being second to his own Casually drawing a card,\nand not showing it to anybody, he remarks, “Very well, Mademoiselle,\ntell me, if you please, what this is ”\n“The three of clubs,” she answers; and the Professor then shows the\ncard to all, demonstrating the skill of the gifted lady For an extensive programme a greater number of codes is necessary We give an idea for some of these which may prove of use An\nunfailing memory is essential to second-sight, and the greater the\nnumber of codes that can be learned, the more sure of success can\nboth performers feel Clothes and Materials\nCoat\nC\nOvercoat\nOC\nDress Coat\nDC\n\n\nWaistcoat\nG\nTrousers\nT\nBoots\nB\nShoes\nS\nHandkerchief\nN\nBodice\nE\nSkirt\nF\nShawl\nH\nWrapper\nA\nSilk\nQ\nCloth\nP\nSerge\nO\nCotton\nM\nTouching a lady’s wrapper, the Professor says: “What do I touch Answer quickly, if you please ” (Touch = part of clothing, A =\nwrapper, Q = silk )\n“You are now touching a silk wrapper,” replies Mlle Again there may be a separate code for flowers, to be introduced by\n“What is this before me ” to show Mlle C that the Flower Code will\nfollow Rose\nS\nViolet\nW\nSnowdrop\nT\nPansy\nQ\nCarnation\nD\nOrchid\nP\nNarcissus\nE\nPink\nR\nWhite\nA\nRed\nB\n“What is this before me Be descriptive ”\n\n\n“A red carnation,” replies the lady unhesitatingly “Well, if you please, what is this flower ”\n“It is a violet ”\nThe Professor and Mlle C have nearly finished their entertainment But before bowing farewell to the company, he approaches a little\ngirl, let us say in the audience, and in a whisper asks her age With\nthe utmost secrecy she informs him that she is just nine “Pray, how old is my little friend here ” he demands of Mlle “Nine years old,” she replies at once “What is your name ” whispers the Professor to the little girl “Margery,” she whispers back “Now Be sure Having found so easily, if you please, her age, what\nis the young lady’s name ” (N = m, b = a, s = r, h = g, f = e, s =\nr, easily = y )\n“Her name is Margery,” is the reply; and with this pretty example of\nhis power, the Professor will close the evening I have dealt at such length with the Professor and his codes,\nbecause it is the easiest and most general system of mechanical\nsecond-sight But Professor B and Mlle C have yet another system of\nsecond-sight, more puzzling still to the spectators, as not a word is\nexchanged between either of the confederates during the whole\nperformance Seating the lady upon the stage, facing the audience, and omitting\nto bandage her eyes, Professor B goes down amongst the spectators as\nbefore, examines various articles, is told different numbers and\ntouches sundry objects exactly as in the former entertainment Without speaking a single word he merely glances at Mlle C, who\nafter a few seconds mentions the number or describes the article as\nthe case may be All this is highly mysterious, and is the result of a very ingenious\nmode of signaling which may be thus explained As soon as Professor B raises his eyes to Mlle C they both start\ncounting to themselves, and the instant he drops his eyes they cease This has been practiced over and over again until they have learned to\ncount exactly at the same speed The result is that when the Professor\nhas counted five, let us say, Mlle C has counted five also, and so with\nany number The alphabet is then coded with numbers according to the following\nsystem 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1\nF\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\n2\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\n3\nR\nQ\nP\nO\nN\nM\n4\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\n5\n—\n—\n—\n—\nZ\nY\nThe letters are represented by the vertical figures on the left and the\nhorizontal figures on the top, and by this ingenious means are\ncommunicated To signal the letter A the Professor would glance up at Mlle C,\ncount one, and then glance down again; he would then look up and\ncount six and lower his eyes once more Supposing that some lady had lent a diamond ring, the process\nwould be the\nfollowing:—\n(The letter U shows when the Professor raised his eyes, and the\nletter D when he lowered them The dots designate the numbers he\nwould count in the interval )\nProf —(without speaking) U D, U D = R, U D, U D = I, U D, U D = N, U D, U D = G Mlle —You have a ring in your hand Prof —U D, U D = D, U D, U D = M, U D, U D = N Mlle —It is a diamond ring Prof —U D, U D = C = 3 Mlle —It has three stones With reference to this last answer it must be explained that the\nnumerals are represented by the letters of the alphabet, A = 1, B = 2,\nC = 3, &c Or again some person holds a bank-note numbered 15498 The\nProfessor communicates this number\nthus:—\n\n\nU D, U D = 1, U D, U D = 5, U D, U D\n= 4, U D, U D = 9, U D, U D = 8 Mlle C then remarks, “The number is 15498 ”\nCumbersome as this may seem at first, a little practice enables the\nsignaling and translating to be done with great rapidity All the codes\npreviously described can be introduced, numbers being substituted for\nletters, or letters for numbers, as may seem expedient Mechanical second-sight has an extraordinary effect in an\nentertainment if well done Both the Professor and his accomplice\nmust be sharp and sure, the least mistake being not only\ndisconcerting, but likely to arouse the suspicions of the spectators If a\nmistake be made, the only thing to be done is for the Professor to\npretend that he has himself mistaken the number or not noticed the\nobject properly, and if this fail he must have recourse to pure “bluff ”\nAll things considered, the number of out-of-the-way objects likely to\nbe produced is really very few, and there is no reason why an\nintelligent couple of amateurs with retentive memories should not\nprovide a successful exhibition of second-sight wherewith to amuse\ntheir credulous friends CHAPTER XXVII\nPAPERGRAPHY\nHow an Excellent Entertainment may be Given with a Sheet\nof Paper\nThe greatest attraction wielded by Papergraphy is, perhaps, the\nextreme simplicity of the apparatus required At first sight it seems utterly impracticable that a first-class\nentertainment, of almost a quarter of an hour’s duration, can be given\nwith a sheet of paper Moreover, very little practice is necessary Cartridge paper is the kind usually employed by professional\nentertainers, and a suitable size is 54 inches by 36 A sheet of these\ndimensions may be purchased from any stationer’s or dealer in artists’\nrequisites Fig 1 —Paper folded Fig 2 —Paper pleated Fig 3 —Rosette The paper must be marked out lengthwise into five parts; the\ncentral section being 12 inches wide and the two on each side 6\ninches in width The paper should next be folded along these lines\n(Fig 1), and once again folded into a series of pleats, as depicted in\nFig 2 A convenient width for these pleats is 1 inch All being now ready for the first demonstration in Papergraphy,\ncommence by forming a Rosette (Fig 3) Close up the pleated paper, and pull round the corners of each until\nthey meet Table Mat (Fig 4) Keeping hold of the ends of the rosette, stretch\n\n\nout the pleats as far as possible A Primitive Boat (Fig 5) With the pleats still fully extended, turn\neach end up, almost at right angles Fig 4 —Table mat Fig 5 —Primitive boat Church Window (Fig 6) This is formed very similarly to the table\nmat, the difference being that one end is allowed to hang straight\ndown Fan (Fig 7) Close up the pleats and spread out one end in the form\nof a semicircle For the next series of transformations, the first fold (A, Fig 1) must\nbe opened Fig 6 —Church window Fig 7 —Fan Fig 8 —Mushroom Mushroom (Fig 8) Pull both ends round to form a cylinder, with\nthe open fold at the top Candlestick (Fig 9) This is made by simply turning the mushroom\nupside down Clown’s Hat (Fig 10) Press the top of the candlestick together,\nmaking it as pointed as possible, and place upon the head, with the\nfolded bottom acting as a brim The second fold—on the same side as the fold already employed—\nmust now be opened Flower Vase (Fig 11) Keeping the two folds well open, pull the ends\n\n\nround, into the form of a cylinder Eastern Water-Jug (Fig 12) Bend the paper round in the reverse\ndirection to that forming the flower vase Then close the bottom end,\nand place on the shoulder, as though carrying a pitcher Fig 9 —Candlestick Fig 10 —Welsh hat Chinese Mandarin (Fig 13)",

    "1 It\nis quite unnecessary to throw the ball higher than four feet By an\nobservation of the usual method of catching a ball, it will be noticed\nthat the hand usually follows the course of the ball; but the great\nobject of the juggler is to learn to catch without moving the hand\nfrom the position it occupied when throwing the ball into the air The great point of the vertical fall is to teach the beginner to move\nhis hands as little as possible, and for this reason the exercise should\nbe practiced with both right and left until such precision is acquired\nthat the movement can be accomplished with the eyes closed The great point of the vertical fall is to teach the beginner to move\nhis hands as little as possible, and for this reason the exercise should\nbe practiced with both right and left until such precision is acquired\nthat the movement can be accomplished with the eyes closed 2 Inside and Outside Falls\nThe inside fall is done by throwing the ball with the right hand, in\nsuch a way that it describes a curve and drops towards the left, as in\nFig 2 2 But instead of catching it with the left hand, catch it with the\nright by a rapid movement of the hand across the body The ball being\nheld in the right hand, it should be thrown back from left to right in a\nsimilar way, as in Fig The ball being\nheld in the right hand, it should be thrown back from left to right in a\nsimilar way, as in Fig 3",
    "3 The latter is called the outside fall This exercise is intended to teach the beginner to throw the ball\nseveral times in succession from side to side without its deviating\nfrom its course The principle involved is very important for jugglery,\nand must be thoroughly acquired before proceeding with other tricks Fig 2 —The inside fall Fig 3 —The outside fall 3 The Parallel Fall\nThis fall presents greater difficulties The ball should be thrown\nwith the right hand, as in the vertical fall, although the hand must be\nkept in a line with the shoulder As soon as the ball has been caught,\nthe hand must be rapidly brought into line with the left shoulder, the\nball thrown from that position, and caught (Fig 4) 4) Having learned the trick with the right hand, it is essential to\nbecome accustomed to perform it equally well with the left hand,\nmoving it to the right shoulder 4 Falls from Right to Left\nBoth hands are required for these falls, which are simply an\n\n\nadaptation of what has just been described The ball should be thrown\nexactly as described in No 2, but instead of moving the right hand\nacross the body to catch the ball when it falls on the left side, the left\nhand should catch it, as in Fig 5, and should immediately return it by\nmeans of the outside fall to the right hand But little practice is\nrequired to learn this perfectly, and when smartly performed it makes\na pretty display Fig 4 —The parallel fall Fig 5 —Falls from right to left 5 The Horizontal Pass\nIn this exercise the ball should be thrown from hand to hand in as\nstraight a line as possible (Fig 6), whilst the beginner must endeavor,\nby continually increasing the distance between his hands, to maintain\na rapid volley Fig 6 —The horizontal pass 6 The Double Vertical Fall\nThis is the first trick requiring two balls, and will need some\nattention A ball should be taken in each hand, and the simple vertical\nfall performed with the right Before this ball has descended, however,\nthe ball in the left hand must be thrown in the air, as in Fig 7, so that\nthe two balls are continually in motion It is at this point that the\njuggler will find the advantage of being proficient in the use of both\nhands for the single vertical fall Fig 7 —The double vertical fall Fig 8 —Variation of double fall A variation of this double fall can be acquired in the following\nmanner:—\nBoth balls should be thrown up at the same time, as in Fig 8, the\nhands being kept about two feet apart, care being taken that neither\nof the balls is thrown higher than the other The beginner must practice these thoroughly until perfectly\naccustomed to having the two balls in motion simultaneously 7 The Double Inside Fall\nThis is a repetition of the outside and inside falls, but performed\nwith two balls at once, and with both hands The utmost care must be\nexercised to avoid a collision as they pass one another, and for this\nreason one ball must be thrown higher than the other, as in Fig 9 Until proficiency is attained the balls should be thrown at various\nheights, and the hands well apart 8 The Triple Pass\nHaving acquired the last trick perfectly, the beginner should now\nbring into use a third ball A glance at Fig 10 will show that the triple\npass is nothing but the double inside fall performed with an additional\nball Two balls are held in the left hand, and one in the right, the former\nbeing numbered 1 and 3, and the latter 2 Ball No 1 is thrown from\nthe left hand, and as soon as it is in the air, No 2 is sent off from the\nright, after which No 3 is thrown from the left hand It will be\nnoticed from Fig 10 that No 1 is sent the highest and No 3 the\nlowest, and by this means a collision can best be avoided The greatest\ncare must be taken to throw the balls regularly, otherwise confusion\nwill ensue Fig 9 —The double inside fall Fig 10 —The triple pass To keep up the volley, each ball must be sent off again as soon as it\nhas been caught, so that after the first throw neither hand holds more\nthan one ball at a time 9 The Triple Over Pass\nThe only difference between this and the Triple Pass is that each\nball, as thrown, passes over instead of under the ball that precedes This is shown in Fig 11, where No 2 passes over No 1, whilst No 3\nis thrown the highest of all This trick is usually combined with the\nordinary Triple Pass, and from the spectator’s point of view presents\nno difference 10 The Shower\nThis is one of the prettiest of all the tricks of Juggling, and should\nbe learned with two balls Take a ball in each hand and throw the\nright one in the air towards the left, whilst as soon as it is in the air\npass the left hand ball to the right hand, as in Fig 12 The moment\nthis latter ball has been caught it must be thrown up in the wake of\nthe first ball, and the whole trick continued as quickly as possible, so\nthat one ball is always in the air Fig 11 —The triple over pass Fig 12 —The shower This should be practiced continually until perfection is attained, as\nit forms an introduction\n\n\nto—\n11 The Triple Shower\nTwo balls must be taken in the right hand, and one in the left The\nfirst two should be thrown in rapid succession from the right to the\nleft, the ball in the latter hand being passed to the right, as in the\nSimple Shower As each ball reaches the left hand pass it rapidly\nacross, as in Fig 13, and start it off in the air once more The trick has the effect of making the spectators imagine that you\nhave a large number of balls in your hands, and the more quickly the\ntrick is done the greater the deception By starting with three balls in\nthe right hand and one in the left a still prettier display can be\nprovided with little extra trouble In this case, however, the balls will\nhave to be thrown rather higher to give the left hand more time to\ncatch the balls and pass them successfully As a final exercise the beginner should\nlearn—\n12 The Double Over Fountain\nFour balls are required for this, a couple being taken in each hand,\nNos 1 and 3 being in the left and Nos 2 and 4 in the right hand Nos 1 and 2 are thrown up simultaneously in the simple Vertical\nFall, as in A, Fig 14 The hands are then rapidly moved apart and\nballs Nos 3 and 4 are thrown over the first two balls in such a manner\nthat they cross each other and are caught in the opposite hands (Fig 14) The volley with those two balls is immediately returned and the\nhands are brought nearer together to catch and throw Nos 1 and 2\nagain Thus the fountain is kept up indefinitely It will be observed\nthat the two hands constantly approach and separate, as the two sets\nof balls are caught in turn, and such action must be very smartly\nperformed Fig 13 —The triple shower Fig 14 —The double over fountain",
    "—The double over fountain The substitution of clubs or knives for balls can be easily effected,\nalthough the performance is none the better for the change In using\nknives, the juggler should see that the handles are well weighted to\ninsure that part of the object falling into his hand The substitution of\nknives is not sufficiently interesting to compensate for the additional\nrisk, and the amateur may very well dispense with them Plates and clubs are equally unwieldy, and the juggler can scarcely\ndo better than content himself with the plain balls, the manipulation\nof which is certain to provide a pretty and interesting entertainment\nat all times CHAPTER XXIX\nPLATE-SPINNING AND WALTZING\nAn Exciting Entertainment\nFew things are productive of such literally breathless interest as\nplate-spinning In what a state of agonized anxiety your audience will\nbe as they watch you imperturbably spinning a soup-plate on the end\nof a rod How they will catch their breaths as they expect it to fall,\nand how surprised they will be when it keeps its position Yet if you\ninform them that it is not so difficult as it looks, you will be stating a\nfact, although the art is acquired only after considerable practice and\nat the cost of several plates To minimize the breakage of crockery it will be as well to begin\nyour experiments with a mattress laid upon the floor, or failing this,\nwith a good substantial down comforter The first attempts will not\nthen be accompanied by such mortality amongst the plates Procure a rod or wand upon which the plates are to be spun A\nround stick, about 2 feet long, is the most suitable for the purpose Care should be taken to see that it is straight, and it must be well\nsand-papered in order to remove any roughness (Fig 1) Fig 1 —Spinning wand Now reduce one end of the stick to a dull point, which must further\nbe prepared by a rather strange process Place this pointed end in\nyour mouth and moisten it until it is quite soft and all the hardness of\nthe wood has been removed When properly softened the fiber of the\nwood will remain whilst all the “starch”—if one may so call it—has\ndisappeared This preparation gives the stick a certain grip on the\nplate which is indispensable for successful spinning Next take a soup-plate, as in Fig 2, and make it revolve rapidly\nupon the dull end of the rod To do this the following instructions and\nhints should be noted The rod should have a rapid circular motion imparted to it by the\nwrist, so that it cuts a circle of about the same circumference as the\n\n\nsoup-plate The arm should be motionless, the whole movement being\nconfined to the wrist The beginner must not expect immediate\nsuccess, but after considerable practice the knack of describing the\ncircle with the end of the rod will be acquired Now, by making these circles with the plate upon the end of the\nwand you will find that the plate itself begins to spin rapidly, and at\nlength, when it has attained a certain velocity, it finds its center upon\nthe point of the rod and revolves so steadily as to appear motionless\n(Fig 3)",
    "3) Practice spinning with the left hand as well as with the right, for in\nmany cases it is necessary to transfer the wand from one hand to the\nother Probably you will find greater difficulty with the left hand, but\nperseverance is all that is required—perseverance and the mattress Fig 2 —The first stage Fig 3 —The plate finding its center—second stage It is a great mistake to choose a light plate for spinning The heavier\nit is the easier it will be to spin, and you will find that dishes (not\nnecessarily round) will be the best spinners of all Do not forget that\nvery heavy dishes soon tire the wrist and make it too unsteady for\nsuccessfully exhibiting other tricks So far the modus operandi with unprepared and ordinary plates has\nbeen described It is quite as well that the learner should begin with\nthese, as the greater difficulty in balancing and spinning will have\ntaught a lesson that will render him more at ease with the prepared\nplates Procure another wand, which need not be “softened ” Sharpen one\nend into a point, not so dull as in the former case, but with a clearly\ndefined apex ” Sharpen one\nend into a point, not so dull as in the former case, but with a clearly\ndefined apex Prepared Plates\nAs to the prepared plates Take for example a thick soup-plate From the center of the bottom of this plate a small, shallow piece\nmust be drilled away, as in Fig 4, which represents a section of the\narticle",
    "4, which represents a section of the\narticle Any china riveter will do this for you, and will, at your\nrequest, polish the cavity after it has been drilled Explain the purpose\nfor which you want it done, as that will insure his making the hole in\nthe dead center Fig 4 4 —Plate with drilled cavity for spinning You will now find that this plate not only spins much more easily,\nbut will continue revolving upon the rod for a great while, even after\nyou have ceased working the latter with your wrist This is an\nimportant consideration in view of the balancing feats to be\naccomplished The next thing to practice is catching the plates in mid-air upon the\ntip of your wand This is not so difficult as it sounds, and should be\neasily learned Toss the plate upwards, as you do so giving it a smart\nturn or twist to the right, so that it revolves rapidly upon its own\ncenter while ascending Now bring the point of the rod under it, and as the plate reaches its\nhighest point in the air it will turn over and you will have an\nopportunity to get the stick into the hole in the center The plate will\nthen spin upon the point of the rod, and a few turns with the wrist\nwill increase its speed and keep it going steadily for a time The plate will\nthen spin upon the point of the rod, and a few turns with the wrist\nwill increase its speed and keep it going steadily for a time Fig 5 —Holding rod for catching Fig 6 —Plate ready for tossing Having mastered the principle of catching the plates in the manner\ndescribed, practice holding the rod and tossing the plate with the\nsame hand Hold the stick near to the point and between the fingers and the\nthumb (Fig 5), whilst the outspread fingers are in the bowl of the\nplate, as in Fig 6 These are shown separately to give a clearer idea of\nthe meaning Now, toss the plate into the air, as has been explained,\n\n\nagain giving the wrist a smart turn to the right Bring the rod sharply\ninto position and catch the plate in the usual fashion Further Feats\nTake a couple of rods, one in each hand, and send a plate spinning\non the point of the right-hand rod By giving a sharp upward jerk you\nwill send the plate high into the air, and upon its descent you can\ncatch it upon the end of the other rod If the plate has been tossed\nvery high, and is therefore likely to descend with some force, care\nmust be taken when catching it not to shatter it into pieces As soon as\nthe plate touches the point of the wand, lower the latter some\ndistance with the plate, and thus break the force of the impact—\ninstead of breaking the plate This performance will prepare you for successfully achieving the\nfollowing very effective show Two persons are required for it,\nhowever, and both must be good spinners Fig 7 —Plate spinning and balancing Let each performer take a plate and a rod Then both should spin\ntheir plates, and throw them to each other, catching the plates upon\ntheir respective wands The volley may then be returned in the same\nmanner, increasing the speed each time until the plates fly from one\nto the other like tennis balls The first attempts will probably result in a shower of broken\ncrockery, but practice will obviate such a palpable disadvantage, and\nafter a time you will be able to complicate the exhibition by taking a\nrod and plate in each hand, thus having four plates flashing to and fro\nat the same time Balancing\nHaving graduated as a master of spinning and catching plates, the\nopportunity has arrived for attempting to balance the spinning dishes This is largely a matter of knack, although a sure eye and a steady\nhand are indispensable Start a plate spinning on a rod, and pass it to the left hand Do the\nsame with a second plate, holding the rod likewise in the left hand,\n\n\ntaking great care, of course, that the plates do not collide Now with the right hand start off a third plate, and balance the rod\nupon your forehead or chin, having done which pass one of the rods\nback from the left to the right hand This makes quite a pleasing\nexhibition, as can be seen by Fig 7, and is well worth learning Presuming you are now facing the spectators, with the three plates\nspinning as in Fig 7, the question naturally arises, how to stop the\nplates in a graceful manner There are several ways of doing this, but\nthe following will be found the simplest Lower the rods in the two hands simultaneously until the plates can\nbe grasped in the fingers Then, with the plate and rod still balanced\nupon your face, lay the two plates upon a convenient table, and taking\none of the rods transfer the rod upon your chin to its point, and thus\nbalancing one upon the other bring the plate to rest Supposing you have a plate spinning upon a wand, balanced upon\nanother as in Fig 8, practice the following method of dispensing with\none of these rods Fig 8 —Plate being spun upon two rods By a sharp upward movement jerk the plate into the air from the\npoint of rod No 1 This will, of course, by relieving the stick of its\nburden, make it fall You then catch the falling rod smartly with the\nother hand But you must not forget during this time the plate which\nyou have sent, still spinning, towards the ceiling Upon its descent\ncatch it neatly upon the tip of wand No 2, and the trick is completed Such are the rudiments of the arts of spinning and balancing Having acquired a thorough knowledge of the various exercises and\nfeats described, the amateur spinner will have no difficulty in\ninventing new things for himself, and will be able to emulate the feats\nof professional jugglers Much patience and long-suffering are\nnecessary, but with a quick eye and a sure hand there is no reason\nwhy any person should not be able to provide a good plate-spinning\nentertainment Plate Waltzing\nThere is a kindred branch of the art which may be described here,\nand that is plate waltzing It is really nothing but an extension of the\n\n\ntrick of spinning a coin upon the table, which every one has done at\nsome time or other A perfectly level table is essential To insure this it is a good plan to\nhave a smooth, unpolished board that can be laid upon a table and\nmade perfectly level by adjusting small pieces of cardboard at the\ncorners Around the edge a slight border should be made, rounded to\nthe surface of the board, as shown in Fig",
    "Around the edge a slight border should be made, rounded to\nthe surface of the board, as shown in Fig 9 9 This will prevent the\nplates from dancing off the table and on to the floor This will prevent the\nplates from dancing off the table and on to the floor Fig 9 —Showing section of table prepared for plate waltzing Fig 10 —The plate waltz Fig 11 11 —How to set the plate in motion Plates of any description and size, from the delicate tea-plate to the\nburly wash-basin are eligible for the dance (Fig 10) The following is the easiest way to start twirling a plate Take a\ndinner-plate and stand it upon its edge on the table with the bottom\nof its upper edge resting against the extended forefinger, as in Fig 11 Describe a small circle with this finger rather quickly, and the plate\nwill follow its motion Continue passing the finger round and round,\naccelerating the motion with each revolution The plate will then\nbegin to revolve very quickly Take your finger away when it has\nacquired sufficient impetus, and leave the plate to dance by itself Begin learning with one plate You will find that as it loses its\nimpetus it begins to go slower and slower, tending to settle bottom\nupwards upon the table But this is where your skill must be proved in\npreventing the fall from lack of momentum Whilst the plate is revolving and before the first signs of falling are\napparent, touch the bottom of the plate fairly near the center with the\ntip of your finger, moving this latter round in the direction followed\nby the plate This will have the effect of preventing the fall, and will\nsend the plate dancing on with renewed vigor Considerable experience will be required to perform this\nsuccessfully, as the exact spot to be touched with the finger can only\n\n\nbe ascertained after much practice Large and heavy plates make the best dancers, and it will be\nnecessary sometimes to use two fingers when preventing the fall, for\nthe pressure must in all cases be firm and steady An ordinary plate is\nbetter than a soup-plate, for not only is it more elegant, but its even\npoise renders the revolutions steadier Practice the use of both hands, remembering, however, that the\nplates will revolve in different directions according to which hand you\nuse The right hand will send a plate twirling from left to right, whilst\nthe left hand causes an opposite motion The plates will keep admirable time to regular waltz music, and\nproduce a pleasing effect Keep your eye upon all of them, being\nready to render assistance to any of your dancers that show signs of\nsubsiding upon the table CHAPTER XXX\nTHE TIGHT-ROPE\nTrick Balancing\nThere are probably few actions more graceful than those of a\nskillful equilibrist The necessity of maintaining a symmetrical posture\nand disposing the body in a well-balanced manner can produce\nnothing but a pleasing effect To a lithe and healthy boy there are\nendless opportunities for creating new figures, whilst many will find\nan attraction in performing feats rarely attempted by any but\nprofessionals",
    "To a lithe and healthy boy there are\nendless opportunities for creating new figures, whilst many will find\nan attraction in performing feats rarely attempted by any but\nprofessionals The whole strain of tight-rope walking is centered in the back The\nrigidity of the legs is also an important factor in maintaining the\nbalance For this reason no child under ten years of age should ever\nbe allowed to attempt anything of this sort, for his bones and muscles\nwill not be sufficiently developed until then All the arrangements for a tight-rope exhibition can be made in an\nordinary drawing-room Very few fixtures are required, and the\nfollowing instructions will give an idea of what must be done Fig 1 —Method of fixing bars of wood The rope should be about four feet from the ground, although if the\nroom is lofty the rope may be even higher A length of good strong\nsash-cord should be used, and thoroughly tested before every\nperformance Assuming that the rope is to be stretched at a height of 4 feet, the\nsupports should be made in the following\nmanner:—\nTwo stout bars of wood, not less than 1 inch in diameter and 6 feet\nlong, should be fastened together in the form of an irregular St Andrew’s Cross, as in Fig 1 They must be fastened by running a bolt\nthrough them at a distance of 1 foot from the top The lower ends\nshould then be beveled off at such an angle that the bars will rest\nevenly upon the floor To these beveled ends a metal plate should be\n\n\nfastened, projecting outwards, with a hole through which a thumb-\nscrew can be passed, as shown in Fig",
    "To these beveled ends a metal plate should be\n\n\nfastened, projecting outwards, with a hole through which a thumb-\nscrew can be passed, as shown in Fig 2 These plates, together with\nthe metal screw-plate, which should be fastened over the holes in the\nfloor, can be bought for a few cents from any hardware store The\ncross-pieces can then be erected and screwed into position, as shown\nin Fig The\ncross-pieces can then be erected and screwed into position, as shown\nin Fig 1 Fig 2 —Metal plate and screw Strong hooks should now be driven into the floor just below the\nwainscoting and in a line with the screw plates Lengths of very strong\nwire are to connect these hooks with the cross at H (Fig Lengths of very strong\nwire are to connect these hooks with the cross at H (Fig 1) When it is\nremembered that these pieces of wire bear the whole strain of the\nrope, it will be evident that too much care cannot be exercised in\nmaking them secure and trustworthy A similar cross with its attachment must then be erected at the\nother side of the room where the tight-rope is to terminate At the\nspot H of this latter cross a piece of bright-colored cloth should be\nfastened, for a purpose which will appear later The rope can now be stretched between the crosses, every care\nbeing taken to see that it is securely fastened and is not in the least\nslack To simplify explanation, the two ends of the rope, with their\nrespective supports, will be called A and B, the latter having the piece\nof colored rag In Fig 3 will be seen the arrangements so far\ncompleted For the purpose of mounting the rope and resting between the\nturns, a pair of steps should be placed between A and the wall, and so\nadjusted that the top step is on a level with the rope, or even slightly\nhigher, say at 41⁄2 feet The Balancing Pole\nThere is much difference of opinion amongst acrobats regarding the\nbalancing pole Some prefer it long and heavy, whilst others dispense\nwith it altogether Amateurs can scarcely hope to do the latter,\nhowever, and 4 ft 6 in may be considered a suitable length The pole\nshould be smooth, round, and even, rather heavier than an ordinary\nbroom-handle It will probably prove useful to mark its exact center\nby a notch A mattress must be laid beneath the rope to break any falls Thin-\nsoled dancing pumps should be worn, the soles being well chalked\nbefore use Such is the apparatus connected with the public performance of\ntight-rope walking The first attempts should be, however, on a rope\nsuspended much lower, not more than 1 foot from the ground, as it is\nuseless to try a high rope until the knack of balancing has been\nacquired The assistance of two friends will be necessary for the first few\ntrials Each must hold a strap fastened around the performer’s waist to\nsupport him until he has learned to find the center of gravity As he\ngrows accustomed to the work their help will become less necessary,\nand he will soon be able to dispense with their services Fig 3 —Tight-rope ready for walking With the pole balanced in his hands, his eyes fixed steadily upon\nthe colored rag at B, known as the “point of sight,” and, supported by\nhis two friends, the first essay is made upon the rope The feet should\nbe turned out as much as possible, and at each step the heel first and\nthen the great toe placed upon the rope The “Forward Walk”\nAccording to the recognized canons of the art, the first thing to be\nlearnt is the “Forward Walk ” The gaze must never leave the “point of\nsight ” Each step must be made with the utmost care, and perfect\nconfidence gained before any attempt is made at more difficult tasks As soon as the feet begin to feel sore or tired, practice should be\nabandoned for that day The next thing to be learned is walking backwards This is really no\nharder than the “Forward Walk” and can be as easily acquired The\neye should be steadfastly fixed on the rag as in the former case",
    "The\neye should be steadfastly fixed on the rag as in the former case With\nthe amateur there is always a tendency to run This must be checked,\nand a stately gait acquired from the beginning After the “Forward” and the “Backward” walks comes the “Forward\nSpring ” Both this and the “Backward Spring” are difficult, and can\n\n\nonly be learned by constant practice and patience There will\ndoubtless be a price to pay in the way of harmless falls and\nstumblings, but everything can be learned in time Indeed, few\ninstructions can be given that would prove of any real assistance to\nthe beginner When once a person has learned to ride a bicycle, the\nmatter of balancing comes naturally; so with rope walking As soon as\nthe tyro has gained confidence and experience on the rope, the\ndifficulties of the “jumps” will gradually disappear Having learned the walks and leaps on the tight-rope, it only\nremains for the performer to adapt them according to his own ideas The aim and object of every professional is to produce some novelty\nin his branch of the art, and the amateur must imitate him in thinking\nout some effective show to be produced “up aloft ” The great Blondin\nused to wheel out a barrow and cook his pancakes upon a rope\nsuspended at an incredible height, and it is in ideas such as these that\nthe art of successful tight-rope walking consists CHAPTER XXXI\nCLOG DANCING\nA Novel Entertainment\nWhen the old Morris Dances decayed in the country districts of\nEngland, many of the local customs and manners died with them, and\nare now entirely lost; but what is considered a survival can yet be\nfound, and is familiar to many of us under the name of Clog Dancing The old Morris Dancers had attached to their ankles bands of bells,\nwhich sounded with the jerking and kicking of the dancers’ feet as\nthey kept time with the measure and music of the accompaniment The use of these bells has now, however, almost entirely ceased,\nand the heavy wooden clog alone remains In place of the ringing and\njingling, with which the Morris man accompanied his dance, the clog\nmakes only a tapping against the floor, sharper in its precision, if less\nmusical than the old bells The clogs suitable for drawing-room dancing have wooden soles\nand leather “uppers ” These can be obtained in endless variety, from\nthe plain black or red morocco, to the stylish patent leather shoes But whatever the style or make of the clogs, one thing is essential—\nthey must fit perfectly The appearance matters little, so long as the\nclogs are an exact fit Nobody present cares to see your feet, but\neverybody desires to see a skillful dance, and that cannot be\nperformed with a loose shoe Having obtained the shoes, the next thing to arrange is the floor A\nsmooth wood floor, or a slate slab, provide excellent surfaces for\npracticing and learning upon, while for the actual drawing-room\nperformance, a thick, smooth piece of wood, about two and a half feet\nsquare, and neatly polished, is very suitable This can be moved at\npleasure, and taken away after the performance is concluded, without\nany awkward rolling back of carpets or moving of furniture It is necessary now to devote a little attention to the more\nimportant steps to be learned In the diagrams illustrating this subject\nthe letter R denotes the right, and L the left foot, and this must be\nconstantly borne in mind to make the illustrations intelligible The first and most important thing to remember, is to keep the toes\n\n\nwell turned outwards wherever the nature of the figure does not\nrender this impossible A glance at Fig 1 will illustrate this In all the\nsteps practice with the left foot is needed more than with the right, as\nthe latter can generally be trusted to take care of itself The First Step\nThe first step to learn is the shuffle, which should be attempted\nwith one foot first, preferably the left Stand firmly upon the right foot, and strike the left toe forward (as\nin Fig 2) towards A, at the same time making a tap upon the floor Draw it back from A towards B, making another tap This should be\ndone repeatedly until it is possible to make the taps in quick\nsuccession and in even time",
    "This should be\ndone repeatedly until it is possible to make the taps in quick\nsuccession and in even time Fig 1 —Correct standing position Fig 2 —The single shuffle Having mastered this with the left foot, acquire the same\nproficiency with the right The ankle must be kept loose and mobile Any stiffness or inflexibility will utterly spoil all efforts Single and Double Shuffles\nHaving become familiar with the two taps with both feet, attempts\nto use right and left alternately should be made, the while standing\nupon the toes Thus: left forward and back, two taps; right forward\nand back, two taps, making in all four taps in rapid and even\nsuccession This is known as the single shuffle, and it is surprising how many\nmusic hall artists and public performers know no more than this\nrudimentary movement Yet it shows how necessary it is to be\nperfectly easy and familiar with the action, which may be considered,\ntogether with the double shuffle, as the ground-work of the art The double shuffle is simply a duplication of the single shuffle Each\nfoot goes forward and backwards twice, making four taps for the right\nand four for the left, or eight taps in all This is really no harder than\nthe single shuffle, and must be learned as thoroughly Indeed, it is\nwise to practice no more steps until these two shuffles have been\nperfectly mastered Having grown familiar with the steps already described, it is time to\nlearn some of the variations of the two shuffles Begin with the single\nshuffle and\nVariation No 1 —Stand upon the toes of both feet, give one tap with the left toe, and\na single shuffle with the right foot Then one tap with the right, and a\nsingle shuffle with the left Keep this up continuously, and as clearly\nand rapidly as possible, taking care that the beats are all equal, and\nthat no one tap is louder than any of the others The result will be a continuous roll, like that of a drum, and is very\neffective Variation No 2 —Give one tap with the left foot, and a shuffle with the right, as in\nthe preceding step, then hop on the left, tap with the right, shuffle\nwith the left, and hop on the right This makes eight taps in all, and\nproduces another continuous roll By pausing on the hop each time,\nanother step is apparently introduced, and the smooth action is varied\npleasantly The hopping mentioned above does not mean a skip into the air It\nis simply employed to give a tap, and is more for the sake of\nappearance than for actual sound It can therefore be replaced by\nmaking a tap with the heel, which is in itself a prominent feature in\nthe Clog Dance Indeed the tap from the heel is often preferable as\nbeing more characteristic and elegant than the hop, which has to be\ndone most gracefully to look at all well Variation No 3 —Make one tap with the left toe, shuffle with the right foot, tap with\nthe left heel, and bring the right toe behind the left foot, as in Fig 3,\nA and B Fig 3 —The third variation This must be learned carefully, and repeated in the opposite way—\nthat is, tap on right toe, shuffle with left foot, tap with right heel, and\nfinish up by bringing the left toe behind the right foot Fig 4 —The fourth variation Fig 5 —The fifth variation Practice both of these steps, and introduce them, one after the\nother, in the actual performance Variation No 4 —Make one tap with the left toe, shuffle with right foot, tap the right\ntoe, shuffle left foot, tap with right heel, and finish with the left toe\n\n\nbehind the right foot, as in Variation No 3 This should be learned\nand repeated in the reverse way to the former step, and the two\nshould be similarly combined to make one continuous action, which is\nreally elegant to watch Variation No 5 —Make one tap with the left toe, a shuffle with the right foot, another\ntap with the right toe, then a shuffle with the left foot, a hop on the\nright toe, finishing with a tap with the left toe either behind the right\nfoot, as in Fig 4, or in front of it, as in Fig 5 Learn to do this with\nthe feet reversed as before If this step be done properly, the result will be a continuous rattle,\nwhich can be kept up indefinitely, the repetitions and reversals\nfollowing one another without break or pause of any kind Variations of Double Shuffle\nThese variations require no detailed description Wherever in the\nabove-mentioned changes the single shuffle is mentioned, a double\nshuffle may be introduced For example, in Variation No",
    "For example, in Variation No 1, for the\ndouble shuffle the instructions should read: Stand upon the toes of\nboth feet; give one tap with the left toe, and a double shuffle with the\nright foot; then one tap with the right, and a double shuffle with the\nleft By treating the other variations in a similar manner, it will be seen\nthat ten variations of the single and double shuffles can be obtained They should all be learned and practiced until there is not the least\ndifficulty in performing any one or all of them The Slide\nThere now remains but the Slide to be learned, and as this is one of\nthe prettiest of all the clog steps, it is well worth taking pains properly\nto acquire Fig 6 —The slide (first position) Fig 7 —The slide (second position) Fig 8 —The slide (third position) Stand as in Fig 6, throwing your weight on the left heel and right\ntoe, which are to be kept stationary Now move the left toe and the\nright heel in the directions shown by the dotted lines Your feet will\nthen be in the position shown in Fig 7 Keep the left toe and the right\nheel stationary, and move the left heel and right toe in the direction\nindicated by the dotted lines in Fig 8 By continuing this movement you have a steady gliding action from\nleft to right, and, reversing the steps, you can, of course, move back\nfrom right to left This is really a hornpipe movement, but for clog dancing it is very\nsuitable for the introduction of taps with heels and toes at every\nchange of position It is also possible to introduce shuffles during the\nmovement, but the plain taps are probably more effective and quite\ndifficult enough to learn without the introduction of more\ncomplicated movements It is possible to dance in clogs to any time, or even against time Acquire the steps accurately and readily, and the measure will take\ncare of itself To practice the shuffles and their variations, the easiest\nplan is to have sixteen bars of music of two-four time, or even a verse\nof any song set to that time As the feet become nimble and the\nactions familiar, you will be adept at dancing to any time or measure,\nwhilst with shuffle and tap your feet will twinkle in the most orthodox\nand poetic manner Practice in the steps described will also enable you to invent\nmovements for yourself, such as jumping in the air, striking the clogs\ntogether once or twice, rattling the clogs together on the ground, and\nnumberless other side tricks and fancies The regular steps are\ngenerally considered the best, however, and should always be\nexecuted when possible, as they form the essence and genius of the\nwhole art Clog dancing is tiring, and it is advisable not to make the dance the\ncentral piece of an evening’s entertainment It makes a good\n\n\naccompaniment or “gag,” but is not suitable for a pièce de résistance Adroitly performed it will win approval; and what more can the home\nentertainer desire CHAPTER XXXII\nSHADOW SHOWS\nHand Shadows\nFew of us have not lain in bed by candle-light and with more or less\nsuccess cast shadows upon the wall Some may have seen public\nentertainments in which shadow pictures formed an important part of\nthe programme, and have wondered in a dim kind of way how they\nwere done From what follows it will be seen how very simple are the\narrangements, and how admirably adapted for a drawing-room\nentertainment a shadow theater can prove Shadow shows may be divided into three kinds They\nare:—\n1",
    "They\nare:—\n1 Hand Shadows—in which the performer stands in view of his\naudience 2 Figure Shadows—in which he stands behind a screen 3 Puppet Shadow Shows—in which the shadows of lay figures\nare exhibited Of these three branches of the art, Hand Shadows are distinctly the\neasiest to do, but they do not give scope for great variety, and\nalthough very good in their way, like most good things, are apt to pall\nupon an audience, who, it must ever be remembered, have an\ninsatiable taste for novelty and change A screen of white cloth about three feet square should be fastened\nto the wall and drawn taut, so as to have no fold or crease A large\nsheet of perfectly smooth white paper will make an equally\nsatisfactory background The best light for casting shadows is given by a candle, which\nshould not be lighted until a minute or so after the lights have been\nturned out This will have the effect of making its light appear all the\nmore brilliant Before attempting to give an exhibition of the various shadows,\nexercise the fingers to make them pliable Clench the fist and try to\nraise one finger without moving the others Raise each finger in turn\nand they will soon become supple; then you may commence learning\n\n\nto make the pictures The candle should be on a level with the hand, and you must stand\nrather to one side of the screen, in order that your body may not\ninterfere with the view of the audience How to Make the Pictures\nFig 1 —A rabbit Fig 2 —A butterfly In Fig 1 you see the well-known rabbit, usually the first shadow\nmade by the amateur performer",
    "1 you see the well-known rabbit, usually the first shadow\nmade by the amateur performer Stretch the right thumb down and\nthe forefinger up as far as it will go, whilst the second and third\nfingers should be thrust out, slightly bent, as shown in the figure With the left hand crook the forefinger against the upright forefinger\nof the right hand, bring the thumb to touch the last-mentioned finger,\nmaking a little loop as depicted Stick the second and third fingers of\nthe left hand upright, although slightly bent Your two hands should\nnow appear as in Fig 1, and the shadow they cast will be that of a\nrabbit The butterfly in Fig 2 is very easily made, and needs little\nexplanation Extend the thumbs of both hands, keeping the four\nfingers of each bunched together Then cross your hands with the thumbs crooked in one another, and\nthe butterfly will be ready to flit on to the screen Fig 3 —A swan To make the swan shown in Fig 3, both arms must be partly bared\nand the right one bent upwards from the elbow Extend the third and\nfourth fingers horizontally, bend the first and second loosely upon\nthemselves and bring the thumb to rest naturally upon their tips Hold\nthe left hand easily at the crook of the elbow, as shown in the figure,\n\n\nand the swan is complete Fig 4 —The greyhound —The greyhound Fig Fig 4 depicts a greyhound ready to sprint Extend the right hand\nthumb and close the fingers together With the left hand bend the\nthumb outwards, double the forefinger, and bring the middle finger\ndown to touch the first finger of the right hand Fig 5 —The hound panting Fig 6 —A countryman Fig 7 —A fireside friend By stretching down the last three fingers of the right hand, as\nshown in Fig 5, the greyhound will be seen panting as he races along,\nwatched by the old countryman depicted in Fig 6 The familiar\nhousehold pet is shown in Fig 7 as she sits warming herself by the\nfire Figs 7A and 7B respectively suggest two other easily produced\nhand shadows, in the former, additional effect being lent by the pipe Fig 7a —The costermonger When you have accustomed yourself to forming these figures\nquickly and accurately, numberless other objects will present\nthemselves to your mind, and as the fingers grow supple the\ncharacters in your repertoire will become more and more numerous\nand amusing Fig 7b —The parson A few racy remarks about each shadow lend an interest to the\nperformance and serve to keep the spectators amused Always be\nquite sure of what you are going to do and how you are going to do it;\narrange your fingers quickly and correctly; do not keep the same\nfigure upon the screen too long, and you are sure to succeed A mistake is fatal, as nothing is more dreary for the visitors than to\nwatch you bungling with your fingers—uncertain how they should be\nplaced Figure Shadows\nThese are, perhaps, more entertaining than hand shadows, but\nrequire much greater space, it being necessary to arrange them\nsomewhat after the manner of tableaux A white sheet must be drawn completely over one end of the room,\nas S in Fig 8, whilst near the opposite wall three boxes of varying\nheight should be arranged as A B C in that figure, a candle being\nplaced upon the middle one There should be no other light in the room, upon either side of the\nscreen",
    "There should be no other light in the room, upon either side of the\nscreen Fig 8 —Arrangement of screen for figure shadows When the performer enters by the door D his shadow is thrown\nupon the screen in a natural size, but as he retires from the screen and\napproaches the candle, his shadow increases to enormous dimensions,\nand very funny effects will be produced A couple of performers may have a fight, the one near the candle\napparently being of gigantic stature, whilst the other close to the\nscreen is of ordinary build With a little practice it can be so managed that the two figures,\nalthough in reality at some distance from one another, appear to come\nto blows, and the incongruity of their respective statures makes the\ngiant and dwarf fight of breathless excitement To add to the ridiculous situation, the giant can be given a\nknockout blow by the dwarf A very small man can be made to make\nlove to a huge woman, vainly endeavoring to reach her face in order\n\n\nto imprint a kiss upon her colossal lips Another amusing picture is to show a figure with a very swollen\ncheek This illusion is best produced by tying a ball of worsted to the\nface The dentist then approaches with a pair of large tongs in one\nhand and a carving knife in the other, opening and closing the tongs\nwith fierce relish Grasping the patient firmly by the throat, he\nextracts a large molar, made of cardboard stuck between the worsted\nand the cheek Then, brandishing aloft the cause of his client’s\ntrouble, he slices off the swollen part of the sufferer’s features,\ndetaching the worsted, and proudly exhibits patient and tooth to the\naudience The Disappearing Man\nA surprising effect to be obtained in these figure shadows is the\ntotal disappearance through the ceiling of one of the actors This is\nvery simply done by stepping upon the lowest box (C), striding over\n(B) which bears the candle, and on to (A) which makes the shadow\nappear to leap into the ceiling Let a figure dressed as a policeman\nrush upon the scene, hotly pursued by a sailor brandishing a stout\nstick The two chase each other about the stage for a time, and\npresently the sailor shouts very fiercely, “Get off the earth with you—\nget off ” and makes a savage rush at the policeman, who, casting one\nterrified glance over his shoulder, steps over the candle, and literally\n“gets off the earth ” The sailor then bursts into a roar of laughter,\ndances a hornpipe, and retires During all these tableaux a running patter should be kept up,\nwhich, combined with the fantastic doings upon the screen, cannot\nfail to keep the spectators in fits of laughter Figure shadows are\ncertainly the most amusing of any Shadow Shows, and are so easily\ndone that fear of failure need deter no one from undertaking them Almost any play can be adapted to Shadow Shows; nursery rhymes,\nburlesques of well-known tragedies, purely farcical buffoonery—none\nwill come amiss so long as there is plenty of action, whilst success is\nassured if all the actors concerned keep the ball rolling At the close of the entertainment, when the last piece has been\nfinished, let one of the figures appear upon the screen and\nrepeat—\n“For in and out, above, about, below,\n\n\n’Tis nothing but a magic Shadow Show,\nPlayed in a box whose candle is the sun,\nRound which we phantom figures come and go ”\nThis will please the grown-up members of your audience who have\nread Omar Khayyám, and will also serve as a suitable finale to the\nevening’s entertainment Having said his little verse, the poet can then\ndisappear into the ceiling Puppet Shadow Shows\nTo work a Puppet Shadow Show is more difficult than either of the\npreceding entertainments, and requires considerable skill and\ningenuity to present satisfactorily As the name implies, the shadows\nin this case are cast upon the screen by lay figures, and the\nperformers, of whom two are requisite, do not appear at all The simplest way to make a “stage” upon which to exhibit your\npuppets is to stretch a strong piece of cord across the corner of a\nroom, and hang therefrom a sheet which shall reach from one wall to\nthe other Some people prefer to stretch it across an open doorway,\nbut this is largely a matter of convenience, and is not always possible Before fastening up the sheet mark upon it a rectangle, as shown in\nFig 9, the rectangle being five feet from the bottom, two feet high,\nand four feet wide Fig 9 —Diagram of screen for puppet show Now take pieces of thick brown paper and tack them over the\nremaining portions of the sheet, so that when completed it shall be\nentirely opaque, except for the rectangle or stage upon which your\nfigures are to perform The brown paper will, of course, be on the side\nhidden from the audience The next thing to be considered is the\nlamp, which should have a tin reflector and a one-inch burner Arrange it in such a manner that it shall hang in the center of the\nstage and some eighteen inches or two feet from the screen—indeed\nat just sufficient distance to allow you to manipulate your figures\nwithout coming into collision with the light If possible shut out all light except that which is thrown by the\nlamp upon the stage, as the darker the room the more effective will be\nthe appearance of the shadows Take great care the sheet is so firmly\nfixed that it neither flaps nor creases Having accomplished this, turn to the making of the puppets The best material from which to manufacture them is thin zinc or\ntin, waste scraps of which any tinsmith will gladly sell for a mere\ntrifle With a pair of shears the metal can be readily cut to any shape,\nwhilst it will also be strong enough to bear the rivets for working the\nfigures The puppets should be about six inches in height This is the best\nway to make them Draw the figure selected upon a piece of fairly\nthin white paper, taking care to accentuate all prominent points and\nfeatures Paste the figure—e g a crossing-sweeper—upon a piece of\ntin, and carefully cut the outline with the shears as in Fig",

    "15) Set pieces such as a church or a house can be easily constructed\nfrom cardboard, as in Fig 16, whilst a very good effect can be\nobtained from a windmill with movable sails (Fig 17) 17) It is scarcely necessary to add that the puppets needed depend\nentirely upon the piece you desire to represent Fig 16 —A house Fig 17 17 —Windmill with movable sails Supposing it is your intention to exhibit three separate plays in the\ncourse of the entertainment, three different sets of figures will be\nrequired The younger members of an audience are quick to observe\nany repetition The figures are made so easily and cheaply that it will be quite as\n\n\nwell to have a complete set for each play Manipulating the Puppets\nThe following hints should be borne in mind when manipulating\nthe puppets Keep all the figures ready for immediate use; lay them\nupon a table in the order in which they will be required, and\nremember where they are so that you can put your hand upon them\nthe moment they are wanted Keep your own head and fingers well\nout of sight—the whole effect will be spoiled if the spectators see a\ngreat black finger pulling some wire or adjusting a refractory limb Keep as calm and collected as possible If some part of a figure sticks and refuses to move, tell the audience,\nin an amusing piece of patter, that Jim, or whatever his name may be,\nhas had a sudden stroke of paralysis, and must be carried away to the\nhospital When there is a hitch—and this will occur even with a professional\n—pass it off with a rattle of bantering fun, making the audience\nimagine it to be part of the show As the puppets are made from thin metal be careful never to turn\nthem round upon the stage March the figures off the scene with some\nquaint excuse, and introduce them again facing in the direction you\ndesire It is impossible to lay too much stress upon the absolute necessity\nfor the showman’s being ready with all kinds of patter Funny as the\nscenes may be made with the figures alone, they are quite\nunentertaining unless all their doings can be explained with an\nunceasing tongue From the moment your first figure appears upon the scene, until the\nlast one has made its exit, a continuous flow of amusing dialogue and\ncomment should keep the audience on tenter-hooks of surprise and\nexcitement—shrieking with laughter over absurd remarks or in an\nagony of wonder as to what will happen next Dull and stupid as\npatter may appear upon paper, it should certainly be written down\nand well studied before beginning the show, for impromptu fun\ncannot be relied upon A lot of extempore humor can be introduced when you yourself\nhave entered into the spirit of the show—but it is imperative that\nregular patter should be learned by heart Nothing can be more\n\n\ntiresome than a halting conversation of which one party has forgotten\nthe cues, whilst the other cannot remember the lines If you can sing, intersperse a song or two here and there when there\nseems a suitable occasion, but be rather sparing than otherwise with\nyour music It may also be borne in mind that it is not necessary to have\ndialogue the whole time A clever and amusing description of what is\nbeing done often proves better than a lengthy conversation in which\nthe characters explain themselves A few crisp remarks are worth a\nbookful of such speeches However, when you are once fairly\nembarked on the play, let your puppets joke and abuse one another as\nmuch as they like To conclude with a few words as to what is suitable for the Puppet\nShadow Theater The great object of every entertainment is to be funny without\nintroducing vulgarity The nature of the show necessitates fairly short\npieces, and experience has proved that several short and amusing\nplays are more appreciated than one long piece, during the\nperformance of which interest is sure to flag Choose commonplace incidents of everyday life An inventive mind\nwill soon adapt the ridiculous side of things to a screamingly funny\nshow",
    "An inventive mind\nwill soon adapt the ridiculous side of things to a screamingly funny\nshow Do not attempt too much With a smart patter, full of current\nexpressions and allusions to topics of the time, preferably local, which\nall your audience can appreciate, the most casual events become\nlaughable Take, for instance, the well-known family\ntrouble—\nThe Plumber\nFigures Mrs Hoggins Mr Plapper Jim, the Plumber Robert, the Policeman Bridget, the Maid With these five characters and a suitable amount of talking an\n\n\namusing sketch can be given The following is a mild suggestion of\nwhat can be done, but you will find that it can be made very much\nfunnier when actually performed Scene, a House (Fig 16) Mrs Hoggins emerges, loudly complaining that a pipe has burst and\nspoiled her nice new carpet She blames everybody in the\nneighborhood, not omitting Mr Hoggins, who is in town “Just like a\nman: never here when he is wanted ”\nShe calls Bridget, and tells her to run for the plumber Bridget seems\nunable to understand “Sure, Mum, and the grocer came this mornin’\nand ye didn’t want any fruit ” Mrs Hoggins then explains matters\nwith considerable volubility, and Bridget departs Mr Plapper rushes out, waving his arm, and complaining that his\nhouse will be ruined by the overflowing water The drawing-room\nceiling has already come down He sees Mrs Hoggins, and asks her\nheatedly what she means by it That lady replies suitably, and they\nwrangle until the plumber comes, when Mr Plapper retires with a few\nsarcastic remarks Jim, the plumber, listens to Mrs Hoggins’ explanation, and\ndisappears into the house to see what he can do, only to reappear in a\nmoment, remarking that he must go home to fetch his hammer He\naccordingly leaves the stage Mr Plapper returns with a policeman, relating matters so excitedly\nthat Robert is not quite sure whether it is a case of fire or merely a\nmurder He enters the house, and Plapper abuses the plumber, who,\nreturning at this moment, thoroughly enters into the spirit of the fray He also goes into the house, but comes out immediately, having\nsuddenly remembered that it is time to go to dinner Mrs Hoggins appears upon the scene once more, and encounters\nPlapper, who asks: “Well, Ma’am, and what have you done about it ”\n“Done If you would do something, instead of standing there talking\nlike a monkey, perhaps we should know where we are ”\nIn an interval of the conversation a loud sound of kissing is heard,\nand Mrs Hoggins demands what it is",
    "Hoggins demands what it is “Water oozing through my\nceiling,” says Plapper Mrs Hoggins laughs satirically and retires She\napparently finds Robert making love to Bridget, for he suddenly\nappears running out of the house very hurriedly, followed by the fiery\nremarks of Mrs Hoggins He is making a few rejoinders when Jim, the\n\n\nplumber, returns just in time to say that his wife is expecting him\nhome to afternoon tea A general chorus of excited abuse is then\nheard, in which Mr A general chorus of excited abuse is then\nheard, in which Mr Plapper joins from the background So Jim walks\naway, saying that he will cut all the water off, leaving them nothing to\ndrink, let alone wash in, until next day This may seem very poor fun, but when staged and supplemented\nwith good strong patter it should be most amusing Opportunities\nalways arise for introducing smart remarks and witty rejoinders,\nwhich cannot fail to “bring the house down ”\nComplete sets of figures, with the various plays for which they are\nintended, can be purchased from all good shops making a specialty of\nentertainment requisites, but it is more interesting to make everything\nfor oneself; and the prospective shadow showman may feel assured\nthat, with care and patience, he will be able to give a performance\nthat, costing but a dollar or two, will prove quite as entertaining as\none purchased at many times the sum CHAPTER XXXIII\nLIGHTNING CARTOONS AND “FAKE” SKETCHING\nA Novel Form of Drawing-Room Entertainment\nAn exhibition of skill which cannot fail to win appreciation from\nany audience, particularly one composed largely of grown-ups, is that\nof making lightning cartoons and sketches It is, however, a form of\nentertainment which should be undertaken only by those possessing\nsome artistic qualifications Although lightning cartoons do not call\nfor any great genius, yet those with an inherent taste for caricaturing\nwill find themselves the best exponents of the work On the other hand, the task may be undertaken by any youth with\neven a moderate knowledge of drawing, because by the observation of\nthe few rules hereafter indicated, quite passable and pleasing results\nmay be obtained The apparatus required is simple and easy to\nprocure The first essential is a cheap easel, which can be purchased\nfor fifty cents from any art store To give it a presentable appearance\nfor a drawing-room entertainment, it should be stained with any oak\nor mahogany composition Those who possess a bent for carpentering\nwill perhaps prefer to make their own easel It can be made from 2\ninch battening First cut two pieces to the required height, and glue or\nmortise together with two stays, A and B (Fig 1) Drill holes for the\nreception of pegs at CC A further length, D, will also be needed for\nthe back stay, hinged at E F shows a section of the hinging Fig 1 —Easel for lightning cartoons The next requisite is a large drawing-board Half-a-dozen large\nsheets of cheap cartridge paper should also be procured These latter\nmay be fixed to the drawing-board by nails driven firmly into the top\nright- and left-hand corners in such a manner that each sheet can\neasily be removed after it has been drawn upon The media employed\nfor plain black-and-white drawings are thick sticks of charcoal or soft\ncrayon It should be borne in mind that as lightning sketching permits of no\n\n\nerasures, each subject must be thoroughly committed to memory\nbefore a public demonstration on the paper is attempted The best subjects for a beginner to attempt in black chalk or crayon\nare caricatures of celebrities, those selected all possessing some\nparticularly marked or prominent feature, e g the late Mr Gladstone,\nwith his remarkable forehead, striking nose, and the characteristic\nhigh collar Idiosyncrasies of well-known people should also be seized upon; for\ninstance, the eyeglass and orchid so universally associated with Mr",
    "Idiosyncrasies of well-known people should also be seized upon; for\ninstance, the eyeglass and orchid so universally associated with Mr Joseph Chamberlain Joseph Chamberlain It will be found that if these peculiarities are\nproperly portrayed and accentuated, but very few strokes of the\ncrayon will suffice to produce an unmistakable likeness The budding\ncartoonist should also bear in mind that boldness of execution is\nessential, the strokes being put to paper with free and large sweeps of\nthe hand The subjects intended to be drawn must be selected beforehand, the\norder of their appearance also being prearranged To obtain the correct mental picture of each character or subject, it\nis at first recommended to attempt only heads Let the young\ncartoonist first procure a pronouncedly good photograph, in profile\npreferably, and copy this in detail, gradually omitting half tones or\nshadings until the likeness is apparent when only the minimum of\nstrokes is used As soon as the ability to do this has been thoroughly\nacquired, the outlines should be drawn again and again until the hand\nhas become so accustomed to the correct presentation of the portrait\nthat it can draw it off in a second or two The lightning cartoonist\nmust live up to his reputation for speed Fig 2 —Method of drawing in leading characteristics Fig 3 —Complete cartoon Fig 4 —Showing characteristic features drawn in first Fig 5 —The final stage Now, to treat with the order in which the various features and\nleading characteristics are to be drawn in A start is generally made\nwith the curve above the nose, taking the stroke down and round to\nthe nostril (A, in Fig 2); then the upper lip, mouth, and chin (B), if\npossible, without breaking the line Next take the chalk and draw the\ncrown of head and curve of forehead, beginning at the right-hand top\nof head, presuming the face to be in profile to the left With a\nsweeping stroke draw in either the outline of the hair or bald head,\ncoming back to the forehead and finishing at the point from which the\nstart was made (C, Fig 2) Now, leaving the outline of the face, return\nto the point at which the curve for the hair or head was started, and\nbring round another bold sweep down into the nape of the neck (A,\nFig 3) Shading may be put in according to judgment The eye must\nnext receive attention, afterwards the ear, and, lastly, the collar or any\nother distinguishing mark Simultaneous Drawing\nA welcome variation to the above is produced by a brief exhibition\nof simultaneous drawing with both hands The best method of\nprocedure is to take a piece of chalk in each hand, and, bringing them\ntogether in the middle of the top of the drawing (A, in Fig 6), take\neach hand round and down, the right hand drawing the profile, the\nleft the back of the head, and so complete the picture by working off\nthe lines respectively on the right side with collar and tie, and on the\nleft with the neck and back of coat In Fig 6 the dots show the other\nlines necessary to complete the effect Fig 6 —Simultaneous drawing with both hands A Figured Face\nAnother diversion may be caused by drawing at lightning speed a\nfigured face How this is to be accomplished is not at first apparent\nwhen you sketch in to all intents and purposes at random a few\ndetached numerals, such as appear in Fig 7; but the addition of extra\nfigures produces the very expressive countenance depicted in Fig 8 Fig 7 —Figured face partly finished Fig 8 —Figured face complete A deal of fun may also be extracted from outline representations of\nan egg Commence by sketching in with quick strokes three or four of\nthese Fill in the individual expression of each by such series of lines\nas are suggested in Figs 9 and 10, and as a climax pin to each a\nsuitable paper costume or fancy collar, frill, or tie, as shown in Figs 11 and 12 These latter aids to the equipment of the lightning\ncartoonist must be prepared beforehand from colored tissue paper,\nkept behind the easel, and instantaneously fixed on to the large sheet\nof cartridge paper by means of pins The effect will be both novel and\ngrotesque Fig 9 —A cheerful “eggspression ”\nFig 10 —A mournful “eggspression ”\n \nFig 11 —Egg drawing complete Fig 12 —Egg drawing complete Smoke Pictures\nTo produce wonderfully picturesque and striking examples of land\nand seascapes in the space of a few moments of time appears at first\nsight a task almost beyond the capabilities of the amateur\ndraughtsman Yet such effective additions may be made to the\nprogramme of the lightning cartoonist by his following out the\nsubjoined simple instructions First procure a large sheet of iron or tin, enameled white To\npurchase this in a prepared state is rather expensive, but a very fair\nsubstitute can be made by coating the tin or iron with ordinary white\nenamel Smoke the enamel surface to a uniform blackness by passing it\nbackwards and forwards over an ordinary small hand-lamp, the glass\nchimney of which has been removed Fix the black sheet to the easel,\neither resting it on a wooden rack or across the pegs Fig 13 —Sketch to memorize for smoke picture Fig 14 —Completed smoke picture Before commencing on the actual drawing, memorize a suitable\nsubject, such as a stretch of water gleaming under the moon, with\nlight reflections, as in Fig 13",
    "13 The effect of the finished picture may\nnow be obtained by wiping out the black so that the white enamel\nshows through and forms the lights The removal of the black may be\naccomplished either with the fingers or by means of a soft piece of\nrag In view of the fact that the fingers form a better medium for\ndrawing than does the rag the use of the former is recommended, but\nas the cartoonist may have arranged to follow this part of his\n\n\nentertainment with other drawings on white paper, he would do well,\nwhile dealing with the smoked surface to cover his finger-tips with\nstalls cut from old kid gloves These can be discarded without the\nnecessity for a break in the performance, as would be the case were\nthe fingers blackened in the process Fig 14 shows the finished smoke\npicture produced from the sketch in Fig 13 A Blue B Brown C Green D Dark green Fig 15 —A reversible scene Fig 16 —Initial sketch for “house on the cliff” drawing Topsy-Turveydom\nYet another variation in lightning cartooning is provided by the\nability of the artist to produce pictures which, when turned upside\ndown, show exactly the same view Topsy-Turveydom\nYet another variation in lightning cartooning is provided by the\nability of the artist to produce pictures which, when turned upside\ndown, show exactly the same view These are best done in colored\nchalk or pastel, which is a softer medium and more workable",
    "These are best done in colored\nchalk or pastel, which is a softer medium and more workable Landscapes are peculiarly adaptable to this purpose Fig 15 suggests a\nrealistic example Fig 17 —House on cliff drawing completed Yet a further pleasing addition to the entertainment may be made\nby sketching such a scene as Fig 16 suggests, afterwards over-coloring\nwith white the part representing the sea, and also the jutting rock\nmarked A up to the dotted line; then turning the whole picture on\nend, blacking in on the whitened portion windows and doors, as\nshown in Fig 17 The result will be “The House on the Cliff ”\nShadow Drawings\nA very interesting entertainment is to be brought to a close by a\nshort exhibition of shadow drawing The apparatus required is a\nmagic lantern, before the lens of which is fixed a prepared plate\n\n\nconsisting of glass previously covered with a coating of lamp-black\nand water A sheet of calico should be attached, some distance away,\nto the wall Between the plate and the lantern, and a little to one side,\nstands the operator, who with the aid of a stick or stump sketches the\nsubject upon the plate, the light filtering through throwing an\nenlarged presentment of the picture upon the calico screen CHAPTER XXXIV\nFRICTIONAL FUN\nSome Amusing Electrical Experiments[1]\nElectricity may be said to have a finger in most pies From its\nmanifestations it would appear to be an all-pervading force, and\nmodern research tends always to substantiate this conclusion Thus\ntwo coins—a cent and a quarter—cannot be brought into contact\nwithout producing their quotum of electrical force, and in like manner\nthe principles of its working may often be demonstrated by the\nsimplest apparatus There are two states which this subtle force assumes, called Static\nand Dynamic The former word indicates a condition of rest, and is\napplied to electricity when stored in suitable magazines ready for\ndischarge at a favorable opportunity, just as water may be held in\nlofty reservoirs, ready to pour down and perform work—whether\nuseful or otherwise—if the pipes be opened Dynamic, on the other\nhand, indicates a state of motion; so that Dynamic Electricity means\nthat it is flowing along conductors from one place, where there is a\nlarge quantity of the force, to another less powerful, in the same way\nas—again using the comparison with water—the latter pours along\nconnecting pipes from a high level to a lower Phenomena of static\nelectricity are invariably produced by friction, and some experiments\nof this class will be first described The chief element of success in friction electrical experiments is a\nwarm and dry atmosphere The operations should therefore be\nconducted in a well-ventilated room where the fire has been burning\nsome time, whilst all apparatus may with advantage have stood\nwarming for some time before 1 Rub a 6-inch square of brown paper with a warm silk\nhandkerchief, then place flat against the wall or marble fireplace It\nshould cleave tightly to either of the latter surfaces",

    "1) The needle being\nunable to bend in any direction owing to the cork keeping it rigid,\nwill pierce the coin quite easily, since we know that the steel of which\nthe needle is composed is harder than the copper of the coin Fig 1 —Coin piercing extraordinary Fig 2 —A match trick A Match Trick\nAnother very interesting experiment is that performed with an\nordinary match, a bottle, and a coin Fig 3 —Coin leaving match and dropping into the bottle Bend in two an ordinary large match, thus partly breaking it, in\nsuch a manner that the two parts hold together by a few fibers of\nwood Place it, thus broken, on the neck of a bottle, and then on the match\nplace a dime or any other small coin Having done this ask a friend if he can make the coin fall into the\nbottle without touching the coin, the bottle, or the match You will\nfind that he will search in vain for a solution to this seemingly\nimpossible task, which however may be overcome in a very simple\nmanner, as may now be seen Dip your finger in a glass of water, and placing it above the angle\nformed by the match, allow one or two drops of the liquid to fall on\nthis angle (Fig 2) 2) Immediately the fibers of wood, swollen by the moisture, try to\nstraighten themselves, and you will see the angle of the match\nincrease little by little until the match no longer supports the coin,\nwhich then drops into the bottle (Fig",

    "Well,\ndirectly the hot air contained in the glass comes in contact with the\ncold surface of the plate, the air contracts, and as the plate prevents\n\n\nthe entrance of any more air, a partial vacuum is formed within the\nglass Fig 14 —Joined by air As the atmospheric pressure is much greater than the pressure from\nwithin, the plate remains firmly fixed to the glass (Fig As the atmospheric pressure is much greater than the pressure from\nwithin, the plate remains firmly fixed to the glass (Fig 14) Glass Raising Extraordinary\nThis experiment, similar in principle to the last, is quite as striking\nin its effect It consists of raising in air a glass filled with water, by causing it to\nadhere to the hand when the latter is held quite open With the last experiment fresh in our minds, it is not difficult to\nguess that this phenomenon is due to the existence of a partial\nvacuum under the hand, but it is not so easy to know how to obtain\nthis vacuum The means of carrying out the experiments are as\nfollows:—\nPut the glass filled with water on the table, and over the top place\nthe palm of the hand, taking care that the four fingers are bent almost\nat right angles, as shown in the first of the accompanying figures (Fig 15) If, continuing to press the palm of the hand on the edge of the glass,\nyou raise the four fingers quickly, thus having the palm stretched out,\nyou will force out most of the air which is between your palm and the\nsurface of the water, and in this way you will produce under your\nhand a partial vacuum This vacuum will be sufficient to allow the\natmospheric pressure to overcome the weight of the glass and its\ncontents; thus a sucker is formed which allows the glass to remain\nattached to the hand (Fig",
    "This vacuum will be sufficient to allow the\natmospheric pressure to overcome the weight of the glass and its\ncontents; thus a sucker is formed which allows the glass to remain\nattached to the hand (Fig 16) Fig 15 —Glass raising extraordinary Fig 16 —Glass raising extraordinary A Novel Glass Emptier\nIf you are given a glass filled with water, and a bottle equally full,\nand then asked to empty the glass by means of the bottle, and that\nwithout emptying the bottle itself, you will imagine you have been set\na very difficult task indeed Fig 17 —The glass-emptying bottle You will soon see, however, that the solution to this seemingly\ndifficult experiment is quite simple First take a cork, and in it pierce two holes Through these gently\npush two straws, one being as long as the glass, the other considerably\nlonger (Fig 17) 17) By means of a pellet of bread or wax close the opening of the\nshorter straw, and push the cork into the bottle until the water gushes\nout of the longer straw In order to empty the glass it is now only necessary to turn the\nbottle upside down, in such manner that the little straw touches the\nbottom of the glass Then, taking a pair of scissors, cut this straw very near the end\nwhich is sealed Immediately the water in the glass will flow out by the long straw\nuntil the glass is quite empty, despite the fact that the bottle has\nremained full all the time (Fig",
    "Immediately the water in the glass will flow out by the long straw\nuntil the glass is quite empty, despite the fact that the bottle has\nremained full all the time (Fig 18) Now for a few words of explanation, in order to make clear the\nreason for this unexpected action The two straws form the two arms of a siphon, and as they are full\nof water it is not necessary to remove any air from them Fig 18 —A novel glass-emptier As the liquid flows out of the long straw, it tends to produce in the\nbottle a vacuum As a vacuum is contrary to nature, it is immediately\ndestroyed by the entrance of an equal quantity of water from the little\nstraw, for the atmospheric pressure exerted on the water in the glass\nkeeps this little straw continually full In this way all the water is\ndrawn from the glass by the bottle filled with water A Striking Siphon Experiment\nA very pretty experiment with the siphon may be performed by\nmaking use of the following simple apparatus: An ordinary glass; a\nlittle water colored, say with aniline; a piece of rubber tubing about\nan inch long, one end of which is cut obliquely, as shown in the\ndiagram; together with a piece of glass tubing from four to five feet\nlong Fig 19 —A siphon experiment This tubing may be obtained from almost any druggist Prepare for your experiment by taking the length of tubing and,\nwith a gas flame, drawing one end out to a point Having done this, bend the tube twice, as shown in Fig 19,\nparticular care being taken to avoid any sharp angles The bending of\nthis tubing is easily done by holding it in a gas or spirit-lamp flame\nuntil the flame is colored yellow The glass is then soft enough to be\ngently bent to the required angle Over the end which is not pointed slip the piece of india-rubber\ntubing, and then place this end in the colored water By applying suction to the pointed end of the tube with your\nmouth, the siphon may be set in motion If now you so arrange the tube that the oval opening is partly out of\nwater, the flowing liquid will draw in bubbles of air which, passing\nalternately down the tube with the drops of colored water, produce a\nvery pretty result The shape and size of the air bubbles may be altered at any time by\nraising or lowering the tube, and this will add to the effect of the\nexperiment The experiment may be again varied by removing the tube from the\nliquid, and before lowering it again, allowing 10 or 12 inches of air to\n\n\nenter This long bubble will be seen to pass slowly down the tube until\nit arrives at the small opening, when it will be expelled at a great rate The liquid following this bubble acquires the same velocity, and,\narriving at the point, is ejected with such force that it will rise to a\nheight of 6 or 7 feet An Electric Fountain\nMost of you would like to make an electric fountain, especially\nwhen you learn how simple and easily arranged is this striking\nexperiment Your apparatus consists solely of a glass, a long india-\nrubber tube, with two small glass tubes and a piece of sealing-wax (a\nstick of sulphur or piece of vulcanite will do just as well) Make a small nozzle by drawing out a length of bent glass tubing,\nand, by means of a long piece of india-rubber piping, fix it to another\npiece of bent glass tubing Place the first piece of tubing bent at two\nright angles over the side of a glass filled with water, taking care that\nthe reservoir thus formed is from 3 to 4 feet above the nozzle (Fig 20) When the fountain is playing the issuing jet of water will be\ninclined to one side Now to electrify the fountain Take the piece of sealing-wax,\nvulcanite, or sulphur, and, after seeing that both your hand and the\nmaterial you hold are perfectly dry, rub the sealing-wax on the sleeve\nof your coat",
    "Take the piece of sealing-wax,\nvulcanite, or sulphur, and, after seeing that both your hand and the\nmaterial you hold are perfectly dry, rub the sealing-wax on the sleeve\nof your coat Fig 20 —An electric fountain If now you hold the sealing-wax opposite the stream of water, at a\ndistance of a few feet, a remarkable change will come over the\ncascades Instead of the water falling in scattering drops, these latter\nwill at once unite, and descend in a solid stream, whilst directly the\nsealing-wax is removed the jet of water returns to its original form If\nthe water be allowed to fall on a piece of stiff paper, a difference in\nsound will be noticed according as the water falls in a stream or in\ndrops The Bottle Cannon\nDoubtless you would like to have at home the experience of firing a\ncannon, of hearing a report loud enough to frighten nervous persons,\nto see the shell fly as quick as lightning, and then to witness the recoil\nof your home-made piece of artillery Your apparatus will be quite simple, for you must first take a strong\nbottle, such as a vinegar, or better still, a champagne bottle, and fill it\na third full with water Next take a little carbonate of soda, and also some tartaric acid,\nboth of which may be obtained at any druggist’s, taking care to wrap\nthem in packets which will not be confused one with the other Dissolve the carbonate of soda in the water contained in the bottle,\nat the same time placing the tartaric acid in a playing card rolled in\nthe form of a cylinder, one end of which should be filled with a plug\nof blotting-paper Fig 21 —The bottle cannon Having accomplished this much to your satisfaction, suspend the\ncartridge just made from the cork of the bottle by sticking in it a pin\nto which is attached a thread, particular care being taken that the\nbottle is standing upright on the table, and that the open end of the\ntube is the upper one After having regulated the length of the thread so that the bottom\nof the tube does not touch the liquid in the bottle, tightly fit the cork\nin You now have your cannon charged, and all that remains to be\ndone is to fire it This is done by laying the bottle horizontally on two pencils placed\nparallel to one another, thus forming a gun-carriage Immediately the\nbottle is so placed, the water penetrates the tube, and dissolves the\ntartaric acid The carbonic acid gas which is immediately produced\nblows out the cork with a violent explosion, whilst at the same time,\nowing to the reaction, the bottle rolls back on the two pencils, in\nexact imitation of the recoil of a piece of artillery (Fig 21) CHAPTER XXXVII\nSAFE CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS\nTwentieth-Century “Black Art”\nAs we stand in the twentieth century and peer curiously down the\ncorridors of Time, we find at all periods a deep interest in chemical\nphenomena From the age when wisdom devoted itself in vain to the discovery\nof an elixir of life and a method of transmuting the base metals into\ngold, to the present day, when scientists pursue their experiments\nwith more reasonable and far worthier hopes, chemistry appears\nnever to have suffered any dearth of devotees, despite the fact that in\nolden times one had either to occupy a high position or be a man\ngreatly daring if the Black Art was to be followed without fear of\nmolestation To-day matters are different, so that the junior chemist need only\nanticipate interference from materfamilias—a truly excellent person,\nwho, however, invariably regards chemical concoctions with hostile\ncontempt The obstacles instanced in the previous paragraph being foreseen,\nperhaps no better initiative can be taken than to conciliate the\nhousehold deities by the performance of some particular experiment\nwhich has an obviously beneficial result This might happily be the\nremoval of ink stains from white linen; and naturally, if no cloth\nhappen to be so disfigured, some arrangement must be made whereby\nthe ink is accidentally spilt Experiments with Chlorine\n(1) Apparatus —Erect a 4-oz round-bottom flask about 8 inches\nabove the table (A, Fig 1), by clamping its neck in a wooden clip or\ntwisted stiff iron wire, and fastening this to a firm standard Introduce\nthree or four tablespoonfuls of powdered manganese dioxide\n(obtainable cheaply in qr lbs",
    "lbs at most druggists’), and pour over this\nspirits of salt until the flask is one-third full Into the neck now fit a\ncork provided with two circular holes, through one of which a stem\n\n\nfunnel passes, and into the other a glass tube fits tightly, being bent at\ntwo right angles, as shown in Fig 1 The glass tube may be readily\nbent by softening it first over a spirit lamp—the flame being colored\ndistinct yellow when the glass reaches a pliable state Slide a 41⁄2-inch\ndisc of paper (B, Fig 1) on the free limb of the tube, and also soak\nseveral 4-inch circles of cardboard in water These will make\nsatisfactory covers for the small glass preserve jars, in which the gas is\nto be collected Fig 1 —Apparatus for chlorine experiments (2) Preparation —Place one jar beneath the glass tube so that the\nlatter’s orifice reaches nearly to the bottom, and slide the paper disc\ndown until it covers the mouth of the jar C On warming the glass\nflask gently with a spirit lamp or, if available, Bunsen gas flame, a\ngreenish-yellow gas is evolved, and gradually expels the air from\nflask, tube, and jar, until this latter is filled with heavy chlorine The\nwarming is then interrupted whilst the one jar is removed, covered\nwith a moist cardboard disc, and replaced by another The heating\nagain proceeds, and so on until each remaining jar is successively\nfilled Fig 2 —The unalterable postmark —The unalterable postmark Chlorine Experiments (1) —Damp an addressed envelope, received\nthrough the post, by pressing between sheets of wet blotting-paper,\nand stand it in a jar of chlorine with the cover replaced (A, Fig 2) The writing ink address will soon begin to fade and finally disappear,\nwhilst the postmark, which has been impressed in indelible printing\nink, remains unaltered This reaction shows that chlorine possesses\nthe valuable property of bleaching writing ink It may be turned to\naccount in removing stains from cloth by wetting the spoiled material\nfirst and then standing in a vessel containing the yellow gas (Fig 3) The fabric must be quite damp, however, as bleaching only proceeds\nin the presence of moisture Coloring matters, other than black ink,\nare readily removed by chlorine, as may be strikingly shown by\nsteeping a wet rose blossom or bunch of violets in a jar of the gas (Fig 4); the flowers assume a transparent waxy appearance, that will\npuzzle any spectator as to their real identity Fig 3",

    "This metal\nburns with a yellow flame, or rather colors the hydrogen flame\nyellow Fig 8 —An interesting hydrogen experiment Preparing hydrogen by the foregoing method is inconvenient and\nexpensive if any quantity is to be collected, and so in this case the\nfollowing plan is usually adopted:—Support a flask (A, Fig 8), and\nplace zinc chips (B) in it to the depth of about 1⁄4 inch Fit the mouth\nwith a cork, through which passes a delivery tube (C) and a “thistle”\nfunnel (D), dipping nearly to the level of the zinc When the gas is\nrequired, dilute sulphuric acid—one part oil of vitriol to ten parts\nwater—is poured down the funnel until the flask is about one-third\nfilled (E) Five or ten minutes should be allowed after bubbling has\ncommenced before an attempt is made to light the gas at the delivery\ntube, as otherwise air from the flask may be intermingled in the exact\nproportion to cause a bad explosion No danger need be feared if several\nminutes are allowed for the air to be thoroughly dispelled, or, as an\nadditional measure of safety, a damp towel (F) is wrapped round the flask\nto prevent scattering of the glass in the event of a mishap The glass\ndelivery tube should have been softened in a spirit flame and drawn\nto a fine point where the hydrogen issues The gas will be found to\nburn with an almost colorless flame If a glass tube (A) of larger bore than the delivery pipe be slid over\nthis latter while the gas burns, a peculiar musical note is produced—\nhollow-sounding and shrill (Fig 9) It is caused by the rapid\nsuccession of slight explosions which constitute the combustion of\nhydrogen",
    "It is caused by the rapid\nsuccession of slight explosions which constitute the combustion of\nhydrogen Fig 9 —A musical flame The extreme lightness of hydrogen, as well as its combustibility, is\nwell illustrated by blowing a soap bubble Connect a clay pipe with\nthe glass delivery tube by means of a length of india-rubber tubing,\nand provide this latter with a small clip—tie-clip, for example—so\nthat the gas supply may be shut off at will (Fig Connect a clay pipe with\nthe glass delivery tube by means of a length of india-rubber tubing,\nand provide this latter with a small clip—tie-clip, for example—so\nthat the gas supply may be shut off at will (Fig 10) Let the hydrogen\npass for a minute or so, to clear air out of the clay pipe, and then,\nhaving shut off the gas, dip the pipe bowl into soap-suds Next open\nthe clip until the hydrogen has blown the bubble large enough, and\nthen shut off, shaking the shimmering globe free It will rise very\nquickly, just like

to a block of wood Spirits of Hartshorn Spirits of Hartshorn —Commercial ammonia is actually an aqueous\nsolution of the gas, which dissolves to an abnormal extent in water When it has been absorbed as much as possible the liquid weighs only\n22 25 as much as an equal bulk of water, owing, of course, to the\nlatter’s association with a compound far lighter than itself So great is\nthe energy of solution that heat is dissipated from the liquid as\nabsorption proceeds Conversely, if the gas be dispelled by blowing air\nthrough strong liquor ammoniac, heat is rapidly absorbed at the\nexpense of surrounding objects To show this, stand a small flask in a\npool of water on a wood block, and having about half filled the flask\nwith fresh ammonia, blow into this through a glass tube connected\nwith the mouth by a length of rubber tubing (Fig 11) No long time\nshould elapse before enough heat has been abstracted from the water\nto convert it into ice, so that the flask is frozen firmly to the wood Another demonstration of water’s avidity for ammonia gas is\nafforded by the following performance Erect one large flask (A) in an\ninverted position, so that the distance between its neck and the table\nis several inches greater than its own height Some distance away, as\nshown in Fig 12, erect a small 4-oz flask (B), and half fill it with a\nmixture of four parts sal-ammoniac to three parts slaked lime (C) Fit\nthe neck with a cork and a delivery tube, which has been so bent as to\npass through a stopper in the mouth and reach nearly to the bottom of\na jar (D) packed with quicklime (E) Another glass tube (F) issues from this chamber—but only from just\nbelow the cork’s under surface—and passes upwards into the orifice of\nthe large flask A square of paper (G, in Fig 12) is pushed over the\nglass tube and presses against the mouth of the flask Fig 12 —To prove water’s affection for ammonia If now the mixture in the 4-oz flask be warmed, ammonia gas is\n\n\nproduced, and having been robbed of moisture by the quicklime\nthrough which it passes, travels upwards, and collects in the large\ninverted flask When the action has continued for a little while, stop\nthe heating and remove the delivery tube, and bring an open spirits of\nsalt bottle near the inverted flask’s mouth If dense white fumes are\nimmediately formed, the flask is known to be filled with ammonia\ngas, and must be corked up Fig 13 —A novel fountain Beneath this container is next stood another large flask filled with\nred litmus solution (A) and fitted with a stopper, through which pass\ntwo glass tubes (M and N, in Fig 13) One of these (N) is bent\noutwards, and extends only just inside the flask’s neck, whilst the\nother is long enough to reach from the bottom of the lower flask\nalmost to the top of that holding the ammonia Instead of red litmus\nsolution, a liquid made by boiling red cabbage leaves in water, and\nadding just enough vinegar to dispel entirely the bluish coloration,\nmay be used with equal success The position then is that two flasks—of which the upper (B) holds\nammonia gas, whilst the lower retains a pink solution—are supported\none above the other, their necks approaching and joined by a glass\ntube (M) A second glass tube (N) also emerges from just above the\nsurface of the pink liquid, and is bent outwards from the flask, so that\nit may be held in the mouth When this is blown through, the pink\nwater is forced up the connecting tube (M) and sprays out, fountain-\nlike, within the upper flask Moreover, as the ammonia is so rapidly\nabsorbed by the incoming water, this continually ascends to fill the\nvacuum, which tends to form as the gas is dissolved The fountain\ncontinues to play when the blowing has ceased, and

    "In one of the cups thus obtained make another hole half-\nway up the side, as in Fig 18 18 Now, with a little sealing-wax fasten\nthree straws into these holes In the cork of a fair-sized jar, which should be of some opaque\nglass, bore two holes, through which the straws must be placed at\nunequal heights, as shown in Fig 19 19 Having almost filled the jar with\nclear water, place the cork with the straws so tightly that no air can\npossibly enter either at the sides or by any other means than through\nthe straws The following strange effect will now be obtained Pouring some\ncolored liquid into the top shell A, plain clear water will come from\nthe spout C of the lower shell B, and will continue as long as you pour\nfrom above (Fig 20) The reason of this is that the compressed air in the jar forces the\nclear water through the straw at B, which, being plunged deep into\nthe clear liquid, carries off none of the colored matter passed into the\njar by means of A Fig 19 —Showing positions of straws for experiment Fig 20 —Pouring the colored liquid into the top shell This experiment may be performed with red wine and water, but\nthe result is not quite so satisfactory on account of the ease with\nwhich wine and water mix CHAPTER XXXIX\nMORE EXPERIMENTS\nTIPS AND DODGES FOR THE WINTER EVENINGS\nThe Refractory Cork\nA very interesting and amusing experiment may be performed with\na bottle and a cork Take a cork of a diameter less than the internal diameter of the\nneck of the bottle you propose using, and ask a friend to make it enter\nthe bottle by blowing upon it At first sight this seems a very easy task, and your friend at once\nproceeds to blow strongly upon the cork This, however, instead of\nmaking the cork enter the bottle, causes it to fly out Again your friend tries to overcome the troublesome cork, on the\nnext occasion by blowing very gently, but again it flies out (Fig 1) The explanation of this is as\nfollows:—\nIn blowing upon the cork, a certain amount of air at the same time\nenters the bottle, the air in which becomes so compressed that it\nrapidly ejects the cork There are, however, three ways in which the\nrefractory cork may be overcome Fig 1 —The refractory cork Since you know that by blowing on the cork it is at once ejected, try\nto achieve success by performing the contrary action—that is, by\nwithdrawing some of the air from the bottle Indeed, the experiment will prove to you that, by so doing, you\ncreate in the bottle a partial vacuum, and as soon as your mouth\nleaves the neck of the bottle air enters it owing to atmospheric\npressure This incoming current of air pulls with it the cork, which at\nonce slides into the aperture The same result may also be achieved by first warming the bottle,\nwhen, owing to the expansion of the air, a part of it is expelled Directly the air inside the bottle cools, a vacuum is created, and a\ncurrent of air from without enters If you add to this current of air by\nblowing air from your mouth, you will find this quite sufficient to\ncause the cork to enter the bottle Then, again, having a straw or a\npipe-stem handy, all you have to do is to blow through the tube,\ndirecting the air exactly on the base of the cork, which will once again\nenter the aperture Whichever of these means is adopted, you must always take the\nprecaution of seeing that the bottle is perfectly dry It should be wiped\nevery time The moisture formed in the neck is sufficient to prevent\nthe cork from gliding along the glass The Flying Coin\nYou may be inclined to think that special apparatus is necessary to\nmake a coin fly from the bottom of a glass, but here is shown a very\nsimple method by which the trick may be performed at any moment\nin your home First procure a liqueur glass of conical shape, having in its largest\npart a diameter not much greater than that of a silver dollar At the\nbottom of this glass place a quarter, and above it, near the top of the\nglass, a silver dollar, the latter forming a kind of cover (A, Fig 2) Now declare to your friends that, without touching the dollar, you\nwill make the quarter jump from the glass Fig 2 —The flying coin This at first seems to them an impossibility, but all you have to do\nis to blow very strongly on the edge of the dollar This will make the\nlarger coin turn about on its own diameter into a vertical position,\nwhilst the compressed air under the quarter causes the latter to fly out\nof the glass, after which the dollar returns to its original horizontal\nposition A Cigarette-smoking Lamp-glass\n\n\nThis is a very striking experiment, and is quite easy to perform The\napparatus is also quite simple, and may be easily obtained It consists\nof a lamp-chimney, a cork, a cigarette, together with two little valves Fig 3 —The self-smoking cigarette Tightly cork up one end of the lamp-chimney with a large cork,\nthus hermetically sealing it In this cork bore two holes, one following\nthe line of the cork’s axis and having exactly the same diameter as the\ncigarette: the other being oblique with respect to this axis, and having\na much smaller diameter (Fig 3) Fig 4 —The self-smoking cigarette It is now necessary to make the valves This is done by cutting from\na glove two round pieces of the skin or leather, which, by means of\npins, may be fixed over the holes, one being above the little hole on\nthe top of the cork, the other over the large hole on the under side of\nthe cork The first valve allows the smoke to escape, at the same time\npreventing the entrance of any external air, whilst the lower valve\nallows the smoke from the cigarette to enter the glass tube, but will\nnot allow it to escape by the same hole Having thus made the valves, next plunge the tube in the water as\nfar as the cork, and place the cigarette in the hole made for it After\nhaving lit it, proceed to make the lamp-chimney smoke it In order that it may inhale the smoke, slowly raise the glass By so\ndoing a vacuum is produced between the surface of the water and the\nbottom of the cork To destroy this vacuum, air must enter from\nwithout, and the only means of its entrance is through the cigarette,\nas the valve on the top of the cork remains tightly closed In passing\nthrough the cigarette this current of air greatly assists combustion,\nand the smoke formed will pass with the air into the lamp-chimney If now the glass be lowered again, the air which is compressed by\nso doing closes the central valve, whilst that above the oblique tube is\nopened From this valve the smoke will ascend in clouds (Fig 4)",
    "4) In this way the glass may be made to smoke the whole cigarette Water Swinging\n\n\nNearly every one has seen, at the circus or elsewhere, an acrobat\nexecuting giddy circular movements with a glass of water, and\ndoubtless has wondered how it is that none of the liquid is spilt This\nis due to the action of centrifugal force Having placed the glass full of water on the table, it is only a matter\nof taking it properly with the hand, holding it at arm’s length, and,\nwith the arm thus extended, describing a complete circle, after which\nit may be placed upon the table without the loss of a single drop To insure the success of the experiment, particular attention must\nbe paid to the manner in which the glass is held Instead of taking it\nas you would when drinking, hold it with the hand reversed, the palm\nbeing turned upwards, as shown in Fig Instead of taking it\nas you would when drinking, hold it with the hand reversed, the palm\nbeing turned upwards, as shown in Fig 5 Fig 5 —Centrifugal force experiment First position Without hesitation throw the arm in the air, and swing it, not too\nquickly, but without shaking it, in the direction of the arrows in the\ndiagram (Fig Without hesitation throw the arm in the air, and swing it, not too\nquickly, but without shaking it, in the direction of the arrows in the\ndiagram (Fig 6) Fig 6 —Swinging the glass Fig 7 —The action completed After one complete revolution the glass should be as shown by Fig 7; whilst in this position it may be placed on the table At first it is\nadvisable to practice this experiment with water, but, as more skill is\nacquired, other liquids, such as milk or wine, may be used as occasion\npermits Fig 8 —The spoon mirror A Novel Mirror\nA simple method of illuminating the back of the mouth and throat,\nespecially when throat trouble is suspected, may often be found\n\n\nextremely useful Here is a means of supplying, at a moment’s notice,\nan extemporized illuminant of this kind Take a well-cleaned spoon, and hold it against a candle flame, when\nyou form an excellent mirror, which will permit you to concentrate\nthe rays of light and produce at the back of the throat enough\nillumination for the making of a careful examination (Fig 8) A silver spoon, moreover, allows you to study the curious properties\nof curved mirrors Holding the hollow part of the spoon before your\nface, notice that the head is at the bottom; turn the spoon round, and\nyou have the bulging part a convex mirror, which will show an image,\nvery long and narrow If you approach this face in the spoon little by\nlittle, you will see the nose attain the most amusing proportions A Disappearing Coin\nIf you look at an object which has been placed in water, owing to\nthe phenomenon of refraction, the article appears in a different\nposition from that in which it really is It is due to this phenomenon, therefore, that a stick, when half\nplunged into water, seems to be bent or broken A very interesting experiment based on this principle is the\nfollowing:—\nTake a bowl full of water, and at the bottom place a coin Next\nrequest one of your friends to lower his head until his eye, the edge of\nthe bowl, and the near edge of the cent, appear to be in the same line As a matter of fact, it is not the coin itself that your friend can see,\nbut only the image created by refraction Now, keeping your friend in the same position, inform him that you\nintend to make the coin disappear from his view To do this, remove some of the water from the bowl, which may be\naccomplished by means of a small syringe (Fig",
    "To do this, remove some of the water from the bowl, which may be\naccomplished by means of a small syringe (Fig 9) Fig 9 —The disappearing coin Directly you lower the level of the water, your friend will no longer\nbe able to see the image of the coin, which will be hidden by the side\nof the bowl If, however, the extracted water be replaced, the image of\n\n\nthe coin immediately reappears Electrified Paper\nVery few people realize that paper can be electrified at a moment’s\nnotice, no special apparatus for the purpose being required Take a piece of light paper, which should have been well dried, and\nrub it briskly with a clothes brush, silk handkerchief, or even the open\nhand After a little time the paper, becoming electrified, will adhere to\nyour face, your hands, or your clothes, as easily as if it were attached\nby means of gum Nor is this property confined to thin paper Thick paper, when\ndried, will act in the same manner For instance, take a postcard, dry\nit, and rub it, and you will notice that, as is the case with sealing-wax,\nglass, sulphur, &c , the card has the power of attracting light bodies,\nsuch as small pieces of cork The following interesting experiment may be carried out with an\nelectrified postcard and a walking-stick Balance the walking-stick over the back of a chair, and announce\nthat you can make the stick fall without touching it, without blowing\nit, or without interfering with the chair This is easily possible by\nutilizing the electrified postcard",
    "This is easily possible by\nutilizing the electrified postcard Fig 10 —The electrified postcard First rub it on the sleeve of your coat Now hold it near one end of\nthe stick, and you will notice that the latter follows it as iron follows a\nmagnet (Fig 10), until the moment when the equilibrium being\ndestroyed, the stick falls to the ground Of course the experiment may be varied by using any other suitable\narticle in place of the stick, as for instance a fishing-rod Electrified Balloons\nFrom the last experiment it may have been gathered that if a piece\n\n\nof paper is dried and rubbed with a silk handkerchief or the dry hand\nit will adhere to the face, arms, or clothing It may not be so widely known, however, that if toy balloons be\nfilled with air, and then stroked for a short time with a piece of fur,\nthey will act in the same way as the electrified paper It is rather amusing to see these balloons, after being treated thus,\nplaced against the wall or ceiling, where they will stick as if they were\nglued there Fig 11 —The electrified balloons Having entertained your friends in this manner, you may, by way of\na little change, take two of these toy balloons, and, after having\nelectrified them, suspend them from the same point by means of two\nsilken threads You will be surprised to find that the balloons now repel each other\nin the same manner as pith balls do (Fig",
    "You will be surprised to find that the balloons now repel each other\nin the same manner as pith balls do (Fig 11) Exploding Flour\nFlour will create an explosion Take a large handful of flour, and leave it for some time near the\nfire, in order that every trace of dampness may be expelled Whilst the flour is drying take a large tin box (a cracker tin will do\nadmirably), and near the bottom make a small hole Through this hole pass the end of a piece of india-rubber tubing,\nand place the handful of dry flour in front of it At the other end of the box place a short piece of candle, and after\nlighting it, cover the box with the lid, taking care that it is not too\nfirmly fixed If you now blow down the tube with your mouth, or better still,\nwith a pair of bellows an explosion at once takes place, as a result of\nwhich the lid will be blown off (Fig 12) Fig 12 —Exploding flour If flour be not available the experiment may be performed with\n\n\nequal success by using fine dust, such as may be found on the backs of\npictures, or collected from any elevated parts of the room The Apparently Impossible\nHave you ever had tea on the top of a mountain If so, you will\nagree that your cup of tea could by no means be termed excellent Now, why is it that a cup of tea made on a mountain-top is much\ninferior to one made at a lower level If the fault lay in the tea, the\ndefect could be easily remedied, but such is not the case, for it\ndepends upon the fact that water on the top of a mountain boils at a\nlower temperature than water at the sea-level In order to make a good cup of tea, the water must boil at a\ntemperature very near 100° C , and it is at this temperature that the\nwater is generally boiled in your homes Why is it, then, that water boils at different temperatures at\ndifferent altitudes It is because, as the altitude is increased, so the\natmospheric pressure becomes less At sea-level, atmospheric pressure is equal to about 15 lbs to the\nsquare inch, but at the top of a mountain it is much less The greater\nthe atmospheric pressure the more heat is required before the bubbles\nof vapor formed within the water can break at the surface After this explanation, perhaps the subjoined experiment will be\nattempted with additional interest Take a flask, to which should be fitted a good cork or india-rubber\nstopper, and in it boil some water, taking care of course to remove the\nstopper beforehand After some minutes the steam from the boiling water will have\nexpelled all the air from the flask Now remove the source of heat, at\nthe same time quickly inserting the stopper If the flask is allowed to stand for a minute or two, the temperature\nof the water will fall considerably below 100° C Next inform your friends that, without applying any extra heat, you\nwill cause the water in the flask to boil vigorously again This seems\nto them impossible, especially when you tell them that you are going\nto do it by means of cold water Quickly turn the glass upside down,\nand squeeze a sponge soaked in cold water on its upturned under-\nsurface Immediately the liquid inside will begin to boil, as if extra\n\n\nheat had been applied (Fig 13) Fig 13 —A curious boiling experiment But how are you to explain this apparently extraordinary\nphenomenon Well, directly the cold water comes in contact with the flask it\ncauses the steam contained therein to condense, and, as no air can\nenter, thanks to the well-fitting cork, the pressure on the surface of\nthe warm water is now considerably less than it was before Directly the pressure is lessened the vapor bubbles contained within\nthe warm water are able to rise to the surface, and the water is seen to\nboil merrily Making Coal Gas\nHere is a very simple way of obtaining coal gas Procure an ordinary long clay tobacco pipe, the bowl of which\nshould be filled with very small pieces of coal Carefully cover the top\nwith soft clay, and put the bowl in the fire, with the long stem\nprotruding through the bars Now watch this end of the pipe very\nclosely and see what happens Fig 14 —Simple gas-making Very soon you will notice a light-colored smoke issuing from the\nmouthpiece, but after a time this smoke disappears But what happens\nif you hold a lighted match to the mouthpiece of the pipe Immediately a bright yellow flame appears (Fig 14)",
    "14) The gas now burning is the same gas as is burnt in your house,\nalthough this latter, of course, is much purer If now you take the pipe from the fire, allow it to cool and then\nbreak it, you will be surprised to find that its contents have changed\nin appearance, for, in place of the coal, you will see what looks like a\ncinder This is the coke Thus you have manufactured gas from coal,\n\n\nat the same time producing coke Experiments with Carbonic Acid Gas\nIn a previous chapter, when describing how to make a miniature\ncannon, it was explained that the “gunpowder” with which the “shell”\nwas fired is in reality carbonic acid gas It may not be amiss to show how to generate it, in order that you\nmay discover for yourselves some of its properties There are several ways of obtaining carbonic acid gas, but most of\nthese are of a complicated nature The following, however, is an\nextremely simple method Take a 6-oz or 8-oz flask, and fit it with a cork with a hole, in\nwhich may be fitted a piece of glass tubing This tubing should be bent twice at right angles, as shown in Fig 15, and the longer end should be allowed to dip into a large glass Fig 15 —A carbonic acid gas experiment Into the flask pour a little lemonade, soda water or ginger ale, and\nafter replacing the cork or tube, heat the flask by means of a gas-\nburner or spirit lamp You will notice that bubbles of gas are given off, and, as this gas is\nconsiderably heavier than air, it will, after being forced up the tube,\ndisplace the air in the glass, and gradually fill it To test whether the\nglass is full, hold a match in the top If the match is extinguished, the\nglass which is full may be removed In this way several glasses can be\nfilled, care being taken to cover each with a glass plate or cardboard\ndisc to prevent diffusion",
    "In this way several glasses can be\nfilled, care being taken to cover each with a glass plate or cardboard\ndisc to prevent diffusion From this experiment you will have discovered the three main\nproperties of this gas (commonly known as carbon dioxide)—that it is\ncolorless, is considerably heavier than air, and will not support\ncombustion Its high density affords another interesting experiment,\nwhich consists of pouring the gas from one glass to another (Fig Its high density affords another interesting experiment,\nwhich consists of pouring the gas from one glass to another (Fig 16) Fig 16 —Pouring carbon dioxide from one glass to another Take two glasses, one full of air and the other containing the\ncarbonic acid gas, and into each plunge a lighted match The match of\ncourse will burn in the glass containing air, whilst it will be\nimmediately extinguished when it comes in contact with the carbon\ndioxide You have thus clearly shown which glass contains air and\nwhich contains the gas Now take the glass containing the gas and\npour its contents into the other glass, in exactly the same way as you\nwould pour in water Again test with a lighted match and you will\nfind that the gas has passed from one glass to another, thus proving\nthat it is much heavier than air Next take two glasses, one containing air and the other carbonic\nacid gas, and, by means of a clay pipe, blow a soap bubble into each,\ncarefully watching the different manners in which they behave That\ndropped into the glass containing air will sink to the bottom, where,\ncoming in contact with the glass, it will burst The other bubble,\nhowever, as soon as it reaches the gas in the glass, rebounds owing to\nthe high density of the carbon dioxide, but after a time, when it has\nsettled down, it will float motionless on the surface (Fig 17) Fig 17 —Soap bubbles in A (air), and B, carbon dioxide Before you finish experimenting you should know how to detect the\npresence of carbon dioxide Take a little lime water, which may be\nobtained from any druggist, and pour it into a glass containing carbon\ndioxide Shake the glass, and carefully observe the change which takes\nplace The lime water, which was previously colorless, has assumed a\ncertain milkiness, and if allowed to stand the white powder causing\nthis milkiness will settle at the bottom of the glass This powder\nproves to be calcium carbonate, or chalk, which is always formed\nwhen lime water comes in contact with carbon dioxide, so that you\nhave here a means of detecting the presence of carbon dioxide Breathe into a little lime water and you will learn, from the milky\nappearance it at once assumes, that the air we exhale contains a\ncertain quantity of this interesting gas CHAPTER XL\nPHOTO PASTIMES\nCamera Knights’ Experiments\nIt has been presumed in commencing these notes that most would-\nbe experimenters already possess a camera, or will at least shortly do\nso Thus the greater number of experiments are such as would interest\na camera fiend more deeply than the ordinary reader, although the\nlatter might still derive much enjoyment from conducting them so far\nas the lack of a “dark box” will allow him It will perhaps be as well to spend a paragraph at the outset in\ndescribing simply and noting a few peculiarities about the\ncommonplace camera Photography means drawing by the agency of\nlight Now light is reflected from an illuminated object in straight\nlines or rays, of which a proportion may be collected by a lens and\nthrown in points upon a surface behind (See Fig 1, A, illuminated\nobject; B, lens; C, surface behind lens; D, rays of light thrown upon\nsurface C )\nFig 1 —Rays of light collected by lens and thrown upon surface behind The front of a camera contains the lens, and is provided with a\nmovable shutter, so that light may be only allowed to enter the dark\nbox when a picture is to be taken on one of the sensitive plates inside According to Fig 2—which represents a camera in position to\nphotograph the object A—the light is reflected in rays, which are\ncollected in myriads of groups and cast pointed upon the surface of\nthe sensitized plate B Such ray groups—being parallel when they\nleave the object and pointed after passing the lens—are termed\npencils of light, a most applicable name when they are employed in\n“sketching” a portrait on the photographic plate Fig 2 —Camera in position to photograph object A It will be seen that the action of the lens causes the base of the\nobject to be registered upon the top of the plate, and vice versa—i",
    "It will be seen that the action of the lens causes the base of the\nobject to be registered upon the top of the plate, and vice versa—i e the picture is taken upside down Another noticeable feature about\nthe magazine box camera, which does not, however, apply to the\nfocussing camera with bellows, is that it may not be placed nearer\nthan a certain distance (usually 10 feet or thereabouts) to the object\nphotographed, or else the picture obtained will be blurred Another noticeable feature about\nthe magazine box camera, which does not, however, apply to the\nfocussing camera with bellows, is that it may not be placed nearer\nthan a certain distance (usually 10 feet or thereabouts) to the object\nphotographed, or else the picture obtained will be blurred The\nremembrance of this simple fact will save the loss of many plates to\nthe tyro Finally a last note remains to be taken of the “stops ” These are\nreally various sized holes in a metal screen, any one of which may be\nplaced at will before the lens, and by the use of which the sharpness\nor distinctness of the photograph may be improved Thus a lens at full\naperture will not give such a sharp picture as would be obtained if a\nsmall hole were used, but, as the amount of light permitted to pass in\nthe latter case is much diminished, a longer exposure must be given Consequently when a short-timed snapshot is being secured, the\nlargest practicable aperture or stop should be employed, even though\nthe sharpness of the picture be thereby to some extent sacrificed Having thus briefly reviewed the essential features of a camera,\narrangements may be made for conducting our first experiment Experiment A —A Fireside Photo\nProbably no souvenir can give greater pleasure to the amateur\nphotographer, or prove more acceptable to his bosom chums, than\ntheir portrait, as a fireside group, lighted by the glow from a genial\nfire Nor is this difficult of attainment",
    "Nor is this difficult of attainment First the figures should be grouped seated on chairs—and perhaps\nsome standing behind, if many faces are to be included—in a quarter\ncircle from one chimney-corner, whilst the camera may be securely\nplaced some 9 or 10 feet away, about the position shown at X in Fig 3 Fig 3 —Relative positions of camera and sitters for a fireside photo Next some shade like a small fire-screen must be placed between\n\n\nthe blaze and the camera, in order to protect the sensitized plate from\nthe full glare of the firelight Now of course the photograph is not\nactually secured by the coal flame illumination, which would not be\nbright enough to give proper exposure, so recourse is had to dropping\nsome material into the fire which will burn rapidly with a bright\nwhite flame Magnesium powder is generally used for this purpose Supposing the group to have been arranged and the camera firmly\nin position, the person (B, in Fig 3) seated next the grate should hold\na tablespoonful of saltpeter and also a square inch or so of sheet zinc Then, all being so far ready, let the outside member of the group\n(marked A in Fig 3) open the camera shutter and slip back to his seat,\nwhilst the flashlight operator drops the saltpeter and zinc successively\namong the glowing coals The flame of dazzling brilliancy which\nresults records the sitters’ figures on the plate, so that directly it is\nover, the person (A) may again visit the camera and close the shutter His movements will not be noticeable, since they are made before and\nafter the flashlight The operation of development may be proceeded with at once and\nshould go fairly easily, but flashlight exposures are difficult to\nestimate accurately, and therefore, although a square inch of zinc has\nsufficed for a small group with stop and an extra rapid plate, this\namount may have to be increased if the group be large or if other\nconditions be changed",
    "The operation of development may be proceeded with at once and\nshould go fairly easily, but flashlight exposures are difficult to\nestimate accurately, and therefore, although a square inch of zinc has\nsufficed for a small group with stop and an extra rapid plate, this\namount may have to be increased if the group be large or if other\nconditions be changed One last hint as to behavior of the sitters Let them sit as naturally\nand quietly as possible, but be advised to blink their eyes as much as the\nbright light prompts them rather than keep them staring wide open,\nwhen their faces must wear a most inane expression in the finished\nphoto Experiments B —“Photo-Chemical”\nSalts of silver form the basis of most modern photographic\nprocesses Thus in order to perform chemical experiments of a\nphotographic nature, some solution of silver must be available, the\nnitrate salt being usually employed Fig 4 —Silver solution and precipitate It is best procured at the druggist’s in solution or as crystals, in\n\n\nwhich latter case it must be dissolved for use in clean rain or distilled\nwater The solution need be only weak, but must be kept in a dark\nbottle screened from daylight Chemical test-tubes, if they can be\nobtained, will be found best for the experiments (1) Prepare a weak solution of table salt, and add it drop by drop to\na little of the silver nitrate in a test tube (or wine-glass as a\nmakeshift) A white sediment is precipitated, which, by shading part\nof the tube with a band of paper and exposing to daylight, may be\nshown to be sensitive to light, inasmuch as the unscreened part will\nrapidly turn purple This precipitate consists of silver chloride, which,\nin combination with unaltered nitrate, forms the essential ingredient\nof printing paper In Fig 4, A is Solution; B, Precipitate; C, Band of\nPaper (2) Photographic plates are coated with bromide of silver, a yellow\nsubstance, which may be prepared similarly to the previous\nprecipitate by adding potassium bromide solution (instead of table\nsalt) to the nitrate of silver Its appearance does not change rapidly\nunder the influence of light, but if first exposed and then treated with\na developing solution the yellow color very soon changes to black—\nfinely divided metallic silver being, in fact, produced Actually, light\nmore readily alters the constitution of the bromide than that of the\nwhite chloride, but the former knows better how to preserve an\noutward appearance of composure (3) Suppose, now, another solution be made, this time of the fixing\nsalt known familiarly to every camera knight as “Hypo ” When this is\nadded to either the white chloride or yellow bromide precipitates\nabove noticed, they gradually dissolve away, except such portions as\nhave changed color under the influence of light Such action constitutes the process of fixing a photograph, whereby\nthe sensitive silver compound is removed from those parts of the\npaper or plate which have more or less escaped the influence of light (4) This experiment is an aquatic performance in which one actor\nonly—our old acquaintance Hypo—takes part Provided proper care\nbe taken in the preparatory stages, it will afford at the climax as\nexcellent a spectacle as many another more complex Fig 5 —Preparing saturated solution",
    "—Preparing saturated solution Fig 6 —Grooved cork for “dripping” solutions A tumbler glass full of saturated solution has first to be prepared,\nand this is best done by tying about 1⁄2 lb of Hypo in a piece of\nmuslin, so that it may be held against the rim of the glass and allowed\nto hang in hot water after the manner of Fig 5 5 When an appreciable\nquantity of the salt has dissolved, the liquid being but lukewarm, the\nmuslin bag may be removed and the solution stirred gently Then it\nmust be stood somewhere firm, and allowed to remain absolutely\nundisturbed until cold There should then be a glass full of clear\nliquid, and the phenomenon is at hand Let the smallest crystal of solid Hypo be dropped in this liquid, or\nlet it but be disturbed, and behold a wonderful transformation\nproceeds, until the glass interior becomes a shimmering mass of\nsparkling crystals The reason of this curious behavior is not far to\nseek The reason of this curious behavior is not far to\nseek Hypo, in common with most chemicals, dissolves to a greater\nextent in hot water than in cold, but is different, inasmuch as the\nexcess of salt does not settle out as the solution becomes cold Cold\nsolution is therefore really over-saturated, and to such an extent that\nonly an extra crystal or the least disturbance is sufficient to upset the\ndelicate balance, upon which climax the great excess of Hypo soon\nsettles out (5) This is another reaction in which Hypo takes part, but one other\nsubstance is required as well, viz permanganate of potash Condy’s\nfluid is equally suitable, and in either case the solution need only be\nweak—just a transparent deep pink color The vessel containing this\npermanganate may be about half full When Hypo solution is\ngradually dripped into this and the mixture stirred, the color is\nimmediately dispelled, leaving the liquid clear as water Inasmuch as every photographer knows the necessity for washing\nhis prints until all fixing salt is removed, this decoloring action may\nbe fully employed in testing the washing water occasionally When it\nno longer affects the tint of a pink permanganate solution he may rest\nassured that the deleterious Hypo—like some friends in being\n\n\nwelcome so they stop not too long—has really departed For the ready\nperformance of this experiment it may be noted that any solution can\nmost easily be “dropped in drips” from a bottle whose cork is cut\ngrooved at both sides (Fig 6) Fig 7 —Sensitizing blue-print paper Experiment C —Blue Print Paper\nEngineers’ drawings have for many years past been copied upon\nferro-prussiate, or “blue print” paper The original design being made\nin opaque ink upon tracing linen, a sheet of the sensitive paper is held\nagainst this in strong daylight until blue coloration has advanced\neverywhere except beneath the ink lines of the drawing These remain\nyellow, or rather white, when finished, as the excess of sensitive salt is\nremoved by washing Since this last operation is in itself all-sufficient to insure\npermanency, the simplicity is unique In fact, the impossibilty of\nsecuring other colors than blue has been the only factor to exclude\nthis process from far wider use The preparation of the sensitive surface presents no great\ndifficulties, provided a drawing-paper of good quality be used It\nshould be cut into strips about 6 inches wide, which are passed one by\none up and down (see Fig 7) through a dish containing the following\nsolution: 1 oz ferri-cyanide of potash + 4 oz water, added to 1 oz ammonio-citrate of iron + 4 oz water (Note—4 oz water = nearly\n1⁄4 pint ) This must be done in very dull light—candle or paraffin oil\nby preference—and the wet paper pinned up to dry in a dark\ncupboard, hanging from the edge of a shelf or other projecting\nsupport Then it may be cut into pieces of the required size and stored\nwith a wrapping of tissue and brown paper in a handy box All manner of designs may be produced on this paper, such for\nexample as fern leaves, lace, and embroidery Actual sea-view photos\nor imitation moonlight views also look very well indeed Another\nnotion is to secure the copy of some picture printed in black on thin\npaper, which has been oiled and dried in order to render it translucent\nfor quicker printing The final washings should be thorough, and then\nthe blue print will last its maker as long as the latter cares to keep it",
    "The final washings should be thorough, and then\nthe blue print will last its maker as long as the latter cares to keep it Experiment D —To Show the Constituents of White Light\nFew physicists to-day doubt that light consists of waves set up in an\nall-pervading medium called ether; that, moreover, white light is\ncomposed of different tinted rays—to be seen reflected from the bevel\nedge of a looking-glass, or indeed from the more natural rainbow—\nwhich further are caused by the different lengths of waves whereby\nthe colored lights are propagated Now we may produce these phenomena for ourselves by cutting a\nslit 11⁄2 inches long in a temporary window-shutter, or, more\nconveniently, in the end of a large wooden box (A, Fig 8) 8) Near this a\nglass prism, such as once adorned gas-pendants so profusely, must be\nsupported (B, Fig 8) on a block of wood, and at the opposite end of\nthe box a sheet of paper pinned to the inside (C, Fig 8) The\narrangement is shown in the diagram Now notice, if you regard this screen from the open top—a large\ncloth covering head and box in order to keep out superfluous light—a\nband of color is depicted thereon, gradating gently like a rainbow\nfrom violet through blue and yellow to red Thus the white light\nwhich entered through the slit has been separated into its component\nparts So far, gorgeous enough But for the photographer much greater\ninterest is at hand, will he proceed as follows Place the box so that\nbright sunshine enters through the slit, and after fastening a piece of\nblue print paper instead of the white on the box interior, allow this to\nprint, at the same time excluding extraneous light by a dark cloth\noverspread When this piece of paper has been washed and fixed, the\ncolored band should have registered itself in various shades of blue,\nfrom which it will be noticeable that the purple and blue lights have\ndarkened the paper most, whilst red and yellow hardly affect it at all If ordinary printing paper, or still better, a photographic plate (in\nwhich latter case a considerably shorter exposure will suffice, and\noutside light must be rigorously excluded) be used, instead of the blue\nprint paper, the result is still more striking Fig 8",
    "8 —The refraction of white light into its constituent colors From this experiment further is to be gathered the reason for\ndeveloping plates by red light, which evidently does not affect the\n\n\nsensitive surface in any appreciable degree But, on the other hand,\nspecial orthochromatic plates are made which, by dyeing, have been\nrendered sensitive to the yellow rays as well as to the blue, and if one\nof these be employed to “take” the colored band, technically called\n“spectrum,” a totally different gradation is obtained compared with\nthat on an ordinary plate or on “blue print” paper Then again, suppose instead of sunlight, ordinary lamplight or\nincandescent gas be used as an illuminant, the gradation varies, whilst\nstill another modification is to photograph the spectrum of a\nmethylated spirit-flame in which common salt is being burnt In this\ncase the light is so yellow that an orthochromatic plate must be used Another illuminant worth testing is magnesium ribbon, which also\nmay be ignited in the spirit-flame Before saying a final adieu to these spectrum results, one last item\nremains for remark—last but not least We say that the series of\nvisible colors extended from violet through blue and yellow to red,\nand that darkness obtained at each end Well Mount a plate or piece\nof printing paper inside the box, so that half of it is well in the\ndarkness beyond the bluish-violet bands, and expose long enough to\nsecure a slight opacity in these parts (i e where the blue bands fell)\nwhen the plate is developed and fixed The half of the plate which\nwas in darkness and therefore apparently received no exposure,\nnevertheless develops darker than the remainder, seeming to indicate\nthat some light, although invisible to the human eye, had affected the\nsensitive silver compounds in the plate This is actually the case The\nrays of light which exert this wonderful influence are called “ultra-\nviolet,” meaning beyond the violet, and their existence explains,\namongst other matters, why photography of the heavens has revealed\nthe presence of many thousands more stars than can ever be seen by\nman Such stars emit only “ultra violet” light Experiment E —One Person in Two Places—and Spiritualism\nPictures of a man decapitating himself, or of the reader’s sister\nturning the skipping-rope for another girl, who is herself, may justly\nbe called mystifying Not only may they almost deceive the operator\nhimself, but will quite nonplus the uninitiated, to whom proofs may\nthus be presented of the most impossible happenings Two methods\nare applicable to the production of such freak portraits,\n\n\nviz:—\n(1) To photograph the entire picture in two separate halves on the\nplate, moving the sitter from one position to another for each\nexposure (2) To employ a background as dark and dim as practicable, whilst\nwell-lighting the sitter and furniture, and giving a separate exposure\nfor each position of the model The latter procedure is by far the\nsimpler, and provided reasonably correct exposures are given, success\nshould not be very elusive To take for a concrete example the portrait of a boy playing\ncheckers with himself Hang up a curtain of black or deep-red\nmaterial in some dark recess of a room, and a few feet before it stand\na small bamboo table with checker-board, &c , complete, at which the\nperson to be photographed may be posed sitting As mentioned above,\nall available light must be concentrated on the group, whilst if the\nmodel be wearing light clothes, the effect will be enhanced\naccordingly As to the camera, this may with greatest advantage be of the\nfocussing type, or at any rate a box instrument fitted with magnifiers,\nso that by being placed near to the sitter the latter may be rendered\nlarge and sharp in the portrait whilst the background remains\nindistinct This should be of such a size that its somber image well\ncovers the whole plate A suggested arrangement for the tableau is\nsketched in Fig 9 The first exposure may be made with the person seated at 1—the\nleft-hand side of the table—he either resting one finger on a checker\nas if about to make his move, or adopting such other pose as his\nacting capabilities may suggest Primarily the time of exposure should be just sufficient for the light-\nclothed sitter, and therefore not enough for the table and background,\nwhich receive a second exposure This should be made when the\nmodel has taken his chair to the opposite side of the table, and again\nassumed a position natural to the player, who anxiously watches his\nopponent’s play Fig 9 —One person in two places A Table B Black or red curtain as background C Fireplace D White sheet as reflector E Camera 1 and 2 Positions of sitter in first and second exposures All possible care must, of course, be taken to keep the table\nundisturbed during the model’s movements, and also to insure that no\nlighter object than the sitter himself has a place in either exposure just\nwhere he appears in the other For example, a pile of books must not\nbe photographed during the first exposure just behind or in front of\nthe position which the model is to occupy during the second exposure;\notherwise the vision of books through the person’s transparent chest,\nor a similar incongruous phenomenon, will result Spirit Photography\nSpirit or ghost photography is but a modification of these methods The chief element of success is to ignore the caution of the preceding\nparagraph, and render the ghost figure as transparent as possible The\nfirst exposure should be an adequate one of the human model, who\nhas twisted himself into an attitude of groveling terror compatible\nwith the fright from which he is supposed to be suffering, whilst the\nbackground behind him must be dark and indistinct, if he is next to\nimpersonate the spook The latter’s surroundings, on the contrary,\nmay be as detailed and well-lighted as convenient, because the white-\nrobed figure is to appear transparent A sheet will be fit apparel for the “spirit,” and must be large enough\nto drape entirely the gliding form with outspread arms The second exposure must be abnormally short, so as just to obtain\na faint impression of the sheet and its folds Finally, if the terror-\nstricken person can maintain his attitude of fear during the first\nexposure, and also for the photograph of the ghost, whose rôle may be\ntaken by some one else beneath a sheet, there is no necessity to have\nany part of the background unusually dark Still, darkness is said to\nfavor spooks, so the background is perhaps entirely a matter of choice With such dash toward the borders of the spiritual realm, this series\nof photo experiments must conclude The most ardent camera fiend\ncan scarcely denounce them as embracing too narrow a field when he\n\n\nconsiders that ghosts as well as mundane matters—psychical and\nphysical alike—have been approached Even if his finger-tips do not\nresemble ebony with silver nitrate, he may still rightly term his hobby\nthe “Black Art ” And his friends Well, if present at the researches,\nmay their remarks be unheard Doubtless they will ponder deeply, and\nconclude that the camera does sometimes lie ·········\nSun pictures of the earliest types had been no long time in existence\nbefore a rumor spread that photography could not lie Critics and\nadmirers of the new process rightly enough concluded that a knight of\nthe camera must be constrained to narrow interpretations by his\ninstruments as no artist is by his brushes But this conclusion, held\nwidely now as then, is only in part correct The camera records the\nrelative position of objects absolutely, but may on the other hand\nruthlessly destroy all sense of perspective, or render globular images\nof rectilinear buildings Nor are these the only peculiarities which, in\nthemselves disadvantageous, may frequently be turned to account by\nthe photographer Sensitive plates are seldom correctly exposed They either suffer\nunder- or over-exposure, and when there is a gross error the resulting\npicture either lacks detail and is blotchy, or else presents the light\ngradation of a London fog But, as a set-off to these failings, it might\nbe noted that moonlight pictures are obtainable by excessively short\ndaylight exposures, which give only the outline of the objects, and a\ncontrast between light and shade appropriate to night scenes, whilst\nphotographs of flowers, portraits, and cloud studies may mostly\nreceive full exposure with advantage, the softness of lighting\nengendered lending additional charm to such subjects Fig 10 —Slanting screen (C) with circular aperture to equalize exposures of\nsky (A) and foreground (B) in landscapes Landscapes commonly reveal over-exposure of the sky or\ninadequate exposure of the ground and objects, because the amounts\nof light emitted by these respective portions differ so much To\nobviate this difficulty an early photograph worker devised, and indeed\nused, the arrangement of a circular aperture before the lens, slanting\n\n\nso that it might not admit such large parallels of light from the sky as\nfrom the ground portion The device is more easily understood from\nthe accompanying sketch (Fig 10) Fig 11 —A method of securing “modeling” in portraiture The portrait hunter should rejoice to realize that, by judicious\nprocedure, persons of the coarsest complexion may be flattered in\ntheir likenesses Not the least valuable dodge is to render freckles and\nred blotches invisible by the use of orthochromatic plates, and, if\nnecessary, a yellow screen, which articles prevent the pink skin from\nsecuring any advantage over the insular blotches in point of actinic\nlight value A supplementary method of securing pleasant portrait effects is to\nmount a disc of cardboard (A, Fig 11), round whose edge holes of\nvarious sizes from 1⁄4 to 5⁄8-inch diameter and about 1⁄2-inch apart\nare cut (B, Fig 11), in front of the camera on a spindle (C, Fig 11) as\nshown",
    "11) as\nshown Any one of the holes should be adjustable exactly in front of\nthe lens, and the mode of usage is to spin the card disc rapidly whilst\nthe exposure is being given Any one of the holes should be adjustable exactly in front of\nthe lens, and the mode of usage is to spin the card disc rapidly whilst\nthe exposure is being given This should, of course, be proportionately\nlonger than usual This should, of course, be proportionately\nlonger than usual Novel Results\nExcellent imitations of crayon pictures are to be produced by taking\nthe required photograph through a negative screen, which has been\nmade by copying to equal size or slight reduction, a piece of rough\ndrawing-paper rubbed evenly with charcoal It is employable in two\nways, either by keeping it in contact with the sensitive plate in the\ndark slide whilst the photograph is being taken—a slightly longer\nexposure being given—or else holding it in the frame on the opposite\nside of the negative to the sensitive paper during printing, which is\nconducted in the sunshine By systems of double or triple printing, all manner of novel results\nare obtainable The only difficulty presented in this work is that of\ncorrect registration, but if printing paper—the most usual medium—\nbe employed, this should not be insurmountable even at the first trial As a first instance of these compositions, suppose out of black paper 4\ninches by 6 inches, a piece be removed the shape of the negative\nportion required, and this mask be used to print through on to a\n\n\nsensitized postcard The black shape removed should have been\ngummed on to tissue paper and this used, after the picture portion has\nbeen secured, to print a border—showing the grain of the translucent\npaper—around the photograph For a second, and last, example of triple printing, proceed by first\npreparing the negative of a picture frame, in which, however, an\nordinary plain canvas surface has superseded the work of art The idea\nis then, by multiple printing, to introduce a camera view into this\nframe image, and so make the result resemble the copy of another\npainting Cut a black paper mask with an aperture the exact size of the\ncanvas image in the frame negative, and through this mask print the\nphotograph required a shade lighter than usual Then substitute the\nframe negative, and, with the same mask in place, secure a slight\nrecord of the inner canvas image over the photograph already printed This gives the requisite oil painting effect Lastly the piece of black\npaper, originally removed to form the mask, is fixed over the canvas\nimage of the frame negative and the sensitive paper replaced in\nposition, so that registration and printing of the frame periphery is\nsecured Then toning and fixing ensue, and the “fraud” is complete Fig 1 —Plan of Marionette stage CHAPTER XLI\nHOW TO MAKE AND WORK MARIONETTES\nConstructing the Stage\nMarionettes, though claiming no rivalry to the time-honored\ninstitution of Punch and Judy, have a great charm of their own, and,\nwith no traditional story of Punch, Judy, and Dog Toby, are at liberty\nto perform whatever play their manager may desire Although it is possible, of course, to purchase ready-made\nMarionette theaters and puppets, the purpose of this chapter is to\ndescribe a method by which the whole apparatus can be constructed\nat home at the cost of very little money and time Naturally, the first thing to be made is the stage This must depend\nvery much upon the Marionettes you intend to work As a convenient\nsize, suppose you decide upon figures 8 inches in height This means\nthat the frontage of the stage must be about 28 inches wide by 16\ninches high, whilst it will run back to a depth of some 14 inches Make a base of plain wood, 42 inches by 22 inches If more\nconvenient this can be made in two pieces, each 21 inches by 22\ninches These fit together flush and are held by a couple of hooks and\nnails fastening beneath Glue a block of wood at each corner to form a\nsupport, as shown in Fig 1, which depicts the under side of the base A, B are the two hooks and nails; C, C, C, C are the above-mentioned\nblocks At a distance of 2 inches from what will be the front, and 21⁄2\ninches from either end, cut a mortice in each piece of the base (D, D\nin the figure), through which the tenons of the stage front will project They must, therefore, be made to suit the thickness of the wood\nemployed At a distance of 5 inches from the back make four\nmortices, a couple in each part of the base as E, E, E, E in the figure These will serve to hold the rear of the stage The front of the stage is now constructed as indicated by Fig 2 Two pieces must be made exactly similar to one another, each to form\none-half of the front The tenon, D, should be long enough to pass\nthrough the mortice made for it in the base, and project from the\nother side sufficiently to allow of a peg being pushed through a hole\nbored in it This peg will serve to maintain the upright front in place Furthermore, two hooks must be placed upon one of the halves, to\nfasten to corresponding nails in the other half, thus holding the pieces\nof the stage front firmly together The back of the stage consists of two pieces of wood each 18 inches\nby 18 inches, having tenons to fit into the mortices below the pegs,\nand fastened together by hooks and nails Before proceeding further\nwith the work, bore two holes, of sufficient size to hold a piece of\nstout copper wire firmly in each piece of the base (P, P, P, P, Fig 1) The use of these will be explained shortly Fig 2 —Construction of front of stage The actual fabric of the stage is now complete Bear in mind no\nstring or wire should extend from the front to the back of the stage,\nfor the simple reason that these spaces must be left perfectly clear to\nallow of the exit and entrance of the puppets Fig 3 —Stage front completed Next fix the drapery in the form of curtains to each side of the stage\nfront These must be chosen according to your own taste, and should\nharmonize with the exterior decoration of the theater The curtains\nshould be gathered up and tacked to the stage front from the inside,\nas in Fig 3, from which an idea of the general adornment of the\nwhole theater can be gleaned A Movable Curtain\nThe following plan will be found very suitable for the arrangement\nof the movable curtain Take a piece of strong copper wire and bend\nit, as shown in Fig",
    "Take a piece of strong copper wire and bend\nit, as shown in Fig 4 4 The length of the unbent portion should be\nabout 30 inches Fit the two ends, A and B, into holes bored in the\nstage front, inside and above the opening The wire rod will thus run\nthe whole length of the actual stage, whilst the ends A and B suffice to\nclear the fixed curtains already tacked up Hang the movable curtains\nby a number of little rings upon this rod When drawn, the two\n\n\ncurtains, which should be of some stout material, will completely\ncover the stage Fig 4 —Wire rod for movable curtain The method of drawing the curtains is arranged thus: A string (L,\nFig 5) is passed through the loop C in the rod, through all the rings\nfrom G4 to G, where it is fastened, and then passed on through H and\nall those rings up to the loop D The string L then returns through the\nH rings 4 to 1 to H itself, where it is fastened and ends By pulling the\nstring L when the curtain is drawn, the ring H is therefore drawn\ntowards D and the ring G towards C, thus opening the curtains\nsimultaneously by means of only one string Fig 5 —Arrangement for drawing curtains Fig 6 —Frame for wings Supposing the curtains to be now pulled right back, thread another\nstring, M, through the loop E, pass it through all the G rings and\nacross to H, where it must be fixed Then pass this string through all\nthe H rings, through the loop F, and back by way of H to the ring G,\nwhere it must be tied and end It will now be found that by pulling\nthe string M, the rings G and H are drawn together To avoid any\nconfusion, a distinctive mark should be placed upon the ends L and M\nof each string You must next bend a couple of pieces of strong copper wire into\nthe shape depicted in Fig 6 The sides A B and C D should measure 20\ninches, whilst B C must be of such a length that the ends A and D can\nfit into the holes P P already bored in the base These pieces of wire\nserve to support the wings, trees, or other stage arrangements as\noccasion requires The stage is now complete, and will take to pieces and pack up flat\nwith no trouble or inconvenience of any kind Fig 7 —A stage tree Interior Decoration\nThe next questions that arise concern scenery This depends entirely\nupon the play to be performed The floor of the stage must be covered\nwith suitable paper, or better still with a carpet In the arrangement of\nthe wings and the scenery connected therewith, do not forget that the\nspaces on each side must be left clear Marionettes cannot enter by\ndoors, and a descent from the ceiling is not only undignified but\nimpracticable The side scenery must therefore be as simple as\npossible Unless your performance is to be upon a very extensive scale, the\nactual amount of scenery required is not great An interior can easily\nbe painted Pieces representing the walls of the room can be hung\nupon what may be called the wing wires, whilst the rest of the interior\ncan be painted upon the stage back In all probability a rural scene will also be required A stage tree or\ntwo (Fig 7) should be fastened to the wing wires, and the background\nof sky and landscape need present no difficulty to a handy amateur Street scenes can be arranged by hanging the ends and fronts of\nhouses from the wing wires, whilst the background may either depict\nthe street fading into the distance, or have another house at the\ncorner, after the fashion of stageland A great variety of scenery may\nbe made with the help of an artistic friend; and when at the theater,\ninspect the effects closely By doing this many invaluable hints as to\nsetting and scenic inventions can be acquired But what is a theater without the actors Who are to perform upon\nthe boards you have so carefully constructed It has already been mentioned that the Marionettes are to be about\n8 inches high This will be found a convenient size for the beginner,\nsince very small figures are apt to be troublesome, and large ones are\nsure to prove unwieldly It is important to have the Marionettes so\narticulated that they will readily answer every motion of the\noperator’s strings, and be neither too stiff nor too limp Fig 8 —Dutch doll for puppet Home-made Figures\n\n\nFig 9 —Universal arm-joint The following hints will show how the figures are to be made at\nhome at slight cost Get an ordinary Dutch doll (similar to that shown\nin Fig 8) of the proper size and neatly made Notice that the hip-\njoints allow the legs to move upwards freely, a convenience that the\nordinary doll lacks The knee-joints are after the same pattern, and\nallow the lower part of the leg to double up for sitting and kneeling These joints should be made to work easily and evenly The arms should be attached to the body by what is known as a\nuniversal joint (seen in Fig",
    "The arms should be attached to the body by what is known as a\nuniversal joint (seen in Fig 9) Make the surface A B (Fig 10)\nperfectly even, and then scoop a slight hollow in the wood In this\nhollow drive a staple almost up to the head, leaving only enough\nroom to insert a piece of string in the loop, whilst the head of the\nstaple is level with the surface A B Round off the end of the arm (Fig 11), and pierce a hole about half-an-inch from the end Thread a piece\nof string through the staple and through the hole in the arm, tying the\nends together fairly tightly, so that the arm is perfectly free at the\njoint but does not hang loosely For the head, either touch up the original Peggy’s head to make it\nrespectable, or remove it altogether, replacing it by that of a china\ndoll In the former case, a flaxen wig must be glued over the black\npainted hair, and a human complexion given to the crimson cheeks Undoubtedly a better effect is produced by exchanging heads with a\nchina sister The dressing of the Marionettes need be a matter of no difficulty The costumes must depend entirely upon the nature of the play,\nalthough certain stock characters may be made once and for all, and\nkept in readiness A sailor, a soldier in resplendent uniform, a\npoliceman, and an ordinary man or two can be kept prepared; whilst\nfor the fair sex, an old lady, a young one, a maid-servant, and a little\ngirl are likely to be of service The remainder of your cast must be\nregulated by circumstances The clothing may be fastened to the\nabove-mentioned characters; but in special cases the costumes should\nbe made to take off as occasion may require Fig 10 —Socket for arm Fig 11 —Rounded end of arm Fig 12",
    "12 —Showing how and where threads should be attached Having prepared the figures, they must now be made to act and\nmove in a rational manner Five black threads are attached to each figure and ascend to the\nflies, where they are manipulated by the performer A glance at Fig 12 shows how and where these threads are to be attached Fix A and\nB to the right and left hand respectively, C and D to the knees, whilst\nE must fasten to the back, where it serves to support the figure These\nthreads should be very fine, for the whole success of your undertaking\ndepends upon their concealment Working the Puppets\nFig 13 13 —Finger loops for manipulating puppet There are two methods of holding the threads and working the\npuppets, the first of which is also shown in Fig 12 The arm threads,\nA and B, are attached to the end of a stick, F; the leg threads are\nsimilarly attached to another stick, G, to the center of which the body\nthread, E, is fastened The sticks are then held, one in each hand, or both in the same Although more convenient for manipulation, this method possesses\nthe disadvantage of limiting each operator to the management of one\npuppet, and where there are several characters upon the stage, much\nconfusion may result If the two sticks be held in one hand free play,\nso far as pulling the strings is concerned, is allowed to the fingers, and\nthere should be no difficulty in working two Marionettes at the same\ntime, one with each hand An easier method of manipulating the figures is shown in Fig 13",
    "13 The thread attachments are the same, but instead of being fastened to\nsticks, each string terminates in a brass ring placed upon the finger The threads should be of such a length that, when the hand is held as\nin Fig 13, the body of the puppet will be upright, the legs stretched,\n\n\nand the arms dropped by the sides Place the rings upon the fingers in the following order: The body\nstring, E, to the third finger; the leg strings, C and D, to the thumb\nand little finger; and the arm threads to the first and second fingers, as\nshown in Fig Place the rings upon the fingers in the following order: The body\nstring, E, to the third finger; the leg strings, C and D, to the thumb\nand little finger; and the arm threads to the first and second fingers, as\nshown in Fig 13 With very little practice the figures can be made to walk, the\nprogressive motion of the legs being manipulated by alternately\nmoving the thumb and little finger A similar movement of the first\nand second fingers will put the arms into action When sitting upon a chair, the lower parts of the legs bend by their\nown weight, and you will need only to pull the body string to make\nthe figure rise quite naturally The theater, scenery and actors being ready, it remains to decide\nwhat they shall play Your programme must necessarily be chosen according to the\naudience Presuming there is somebody to assist you in working the\nfigures, thereby making it possible to have three or four characters\nupon the stage at once, the variety of plays is very great, and the\nchoice of one or two short pieces should be easy Several publishers\nissue large assortments of Marionette plays, and catalogues can be\nobtained giving full particulars as to the number of characters\nrequired, scenery necessary, and so forth The Marionette stage is not adapted to heavy drama Tragedies\nwould be ridiculous on the “two foot boards ” The rôles, therefore,\nassumed by each character should be amusing and topical, containing\nallusions likely to be understood by the spectators, and interspersed\nwith such local “gags” as opportunity may suggest The two operators should divide their labors, as far as possible, in\nsuch a way that the lady does the female characters, whilst her\npartner works the men The reason for this division is clear, for it will\ncome more natural for a lady to caricature the female voice, whilst\nher accomplice will be better suited to the stern accents of the\nmenacing policeman, or the passionate entreaties of the ardent lover Working\nPractice the parts carefully and thoroughly Be ready with some\njoke or patter to cover any mishap that may occur Accidents are\nunfortunate, but in Marionette-land quite probable, so if Aladdin’s left\n\n\narm fails to work at the critical moment, there is nothing to do but\nmake the audience think it all part of the fun Supposing the evening for your entertainment to have arrived, and\nthat all is in readiness, place the theater upon a table at such a height\nthat the spectators will get a clear view of the stage, but will not be\nable to see the flies The table should be against a wall, and arranged\nin such a manner that you and your partner have sufficient room to\nmove behind it In the space between the table and wall a couple of\nboards must be placed on trestles, so that the operators may stand\nabove the stage A curtain must hang from the ceiling to meet the top of the theater On no account should the audience be able to watch the heads of the\nmanipulators moving the puppets There are few better plans than to\nhave the stage arranged in the embrasure of a window, for the curtain\ncan then be easily contrived, whilst the “show” does not take any of\nthe space required for the spectators But this, of course, must depend\nupon the nature of the room at your disposal The guests having been marshaled into their places, the\nentertainment should open with an overture If there be intervals in\nthe course of the play, the pianist will find fresh employment, whilst\nat times a running accompaniment is very suitable Start with a one act farce, to be followed by a fairy tale or\npantomime Conclude with another short farce, into which may be\nintroduced all kinds of whimsicalities, jokes, local patter, and topical\nallusions The puppets will do exactly as you direct them Make them work\ntheir best; let the show be worth seeing and hearing, for the\npossibilities of the Marionette stage are very great, and with ordinary\ncare a most enjoyable entertainment can be produced CHAPTER XLII\nLIVING MARIONETTES\nA Good “One Man” Show\nA living Marionette entertainment is well adapted for a “One Man\nShow,” and sure to prove a success The very appearance of the weird\ncreature, half human and half doll, makes the spectators laugh, and\nthis laugh will scarcely subside until the curtain has been finally rung\ndown on the entertainment Fig 1 —The dummy body with the human head Fig 2 —Front view of living Marionette stage The mysterious combination shown in Fig 1 needs but little\nexplanation, since it is very clear that the head is human whilst the\nbody is wooden This makes so comical a figure that anything but\npure humor would seem singularly out of place issuing from those\nlips; it must, therefore, be clearly understood that the living\nMarionette is comic from beginning to end The stage must be about 3 feet wide, and of the same height, thus\nallowing room for the head and false body The stage front may be\nmade in the same manner adopted for the Marionettes proper, though\nso much space will not be required at the top, as can be seen from Fig",
    "The stage front may be\nmade in the same manner adopted for the Marionettes proper, though\nso much space will not be required at the top, as can be seen from Fig 2 2 The stage itself should be about 12 inches deep, and arranged at\nsuch a height that when standing behind, your chin will be about 11\ninches above the stage The whole construction will then be somewhat\nlike the box and stage of an old-fashioned Punch and Judy Show A strip of perfectly black cloth is next stretched from side to side\nalong the inner edge of the stage, i e the part farthest removed from\nthe audience This cloth should be 11 inches wide, and when in place\nwill occupy the position shown in Fig This cloth should be 11 inches wide, and when in place\nwill occupy the position shown in Fig 3 3 Between this edge of the\nstage and the actual back of the box should be a space of 15 inches The actual back must also be covered with black cloth The sectional\nappearance of the stage will therefore be as in Fig 4 An arrangement\n\n\nof curtains, as described in connection with the Marionette stage,\nmust be fitted with the strings below the stage, in order that you may\npull them unseen by the audience The wooden bodies should be 10 inches high, and headless A collar\nmust be sewn to the costume where the neck should be, in order to\nconceal the spot where the living head is thrust over the false body The most satisfactory way of working the limbs of the puppet is as\nfollows: Above the stage, in the flies, a rod, upon which are strung\nseveral brass rings, extends from side to side (A, Fig 4) Now the\nstrings attached to the arms and legs pass up and through these rings,\nwhence they descend behind the cloth screen and are moved invisibly\nby the operator As there is only one figure to work, you can hold the\narm threads in one hand, the leg threads in the other, whilst the\nsupporting body thread passes in a loop around your neck In this way\nthe body is forced to move with the living head, as though really a\npart of it (Fig 5) You should now make up your face to suit the character Suppose\nthe body represents an ordinary Jack Tar, with bell-bottomed\ntrousers, blue collar, and so forth The comic sailor’s beard must be so\nadjusted that its bushiness will conceal what may be called the\njunction between your head and his false body The hat or round cap\ncan be put on at a nautical tilt Having fixed the body-thread around your throat and fastened the\nbeard, crane your own neck forward, and place the Marionette body\nupon the stage, having the strip of black cloth between it and your\nshoulders Arrange the arm and leg strings through the rings, and\nkeep the ends in your hands ready for action When everything is\ncompleted, draw the curtain and commence Fig 4 —Sectional view of Marionette stage Comical Effects\nSongs and monologues are naturally the best turns for the Living\nMarionette Choose a rollicking, nautical song, suitable to Jack Tar All the gestures and motions can be given to the limbs by means of\nthe threads, whilst every now and again Jack can enliven himself and\nthe audience by executing a hornpipe A little practice with the leg-\nstrings will enable you to perform this with great effect Fig 3 —Black cloth arrangement to conceal top of performer’s body Always strive to obtain comical effects If the gallant mariner has a\ntelescope in his hand, this should be raised to the eye, where the\nextraordinary contrast between the tiny hand holding a midget\ntelescope, and the enormous face emerging from its forest of beard, is\nludicrous in the extreme Or if the other branch of the Service be on the boards, the\ncavalryman may flourish a saber, which, at full arm’s length, will\nscarcely reach the tip of his ear A tiny rifle raised to the shoulder\nmakes another laughable effect The Man about Town is a humorous figure Dressed in an\nexaggeration of the latest style, with a dapper strut, flourishing a\nmodish cane, he is a person to be admired—and laughed at Over the\npigmy body looms an enormous face, smoking a huge cigar, big even\nfor an ordinary individual Naturally it would be impossible to sing or\nspeak with the cigar in his mouth, and it cannot be gracefully\nremoved with dummy hands that will scarcely reach it The simplest\nmethod of getting the cigar out of the way is to make “Bertie” stumble\nover his own cane, for instance, and in the agitation of the moment\ndrop his “smoke ” He will then be able to air his peculiarities in\ncomfort, and will prove a most amusing personage Two figures may be introduced upon the stage, although they are\nlikely to prove a tight fit Some laughable dialogues and duets are the\nresult Quarrels or love scenes must be intensely funny A young\ngentleman and a younger lady can be introduced with much\nformality, and, advancing to shake hands, meet with an embarrassing\n\n\nadventure, pleasant enough in its way Owing to the smallness of their\narms and the largeness of their faces, before their hands have met,\ntheir lips have perforce sealed the contract of friendship A general idea of Living Marionettes and their working may be\ngained from the foregoing suggestions Sentimental songs, sung with a\nwhimsical air of grotesque pathos, will probably “bring the house\ndown,” whilst the applause attending a good comic song in character\nwill encourage all parties concerned Living Marionettes are sometimes introduced in conjunction with\nan ordinary Marionette show, and should be given after the latter has\nconcluded The contrast between the symmetrical little mannikins and\nthe distorted living doll will be remarkable, whilst the exuberant\nhumor of the latter is sure to provide a pleasant finale to what all will\njudge a delightful evening Fig 5 —Living Marionette operator at work CHAPTER XLIII\nA HOME CIRCUS\nA New Form of Entertainment\nA home circus has so far been beyond the wildest dreams of the\namateur showman Yet when one considers the wide scope a circus\npresents to performers of every type, it is curious that “amateur\ncircuses” are not almost as popular as “amateur theatricals ” At first\nsight such a show seems impracticable, on account of the large floor\narea required for the ring This need occupy but little more space than\na stage, however; and, taking into consideration the fact that the\naudience almost completely surrounds the performers, it will\nultimately be found that a circus does not necessitate so large a room\nas might be anticipated Fig 1 —Showing barricade and ring entrance Of premier importance, of course, is the ring itself It need not be\nmore than fifteen feet in diameter; but if additional space can be\nspared, so much the better Fig 1 gives a plan of a ring It principally consists of a circular\nbarricade about 30 inches high In one portion there is a gap of four\nor five feet, which acts as an entrance (A, Fig 1) If the ring can be so\narranged that a door of the room in which the circus is being\nconstructed, coincides with this entrance, much trouble will be saved Should this be impossible, however, two or three screens can be\narranged to form a passage from the ring entrance to the nearest door The method of constructing the barricade is explained in Fig",
    "The method of constructing the barricade is explained in Fig 2 A\nnumber of broomsticks are sawn into 30 inch lengths and fixed to\nheavy wooden bases in order that they may stand firmly upon the\nfloor A hole is then bored in the other extremity; this may be done by\nmeans of a red-hot meat skewer The position selected for the ring must next be marked out in chalk,\nand the wooden stands placed round it at intervals of about a yard Then thread a piece of stout cord through the holes in the extremities\n\n\nof the uprights Having determined the exact circumference of the ring, purchase a\nsufficient length of cheap red flannelette to go completely round it The cost of this material should be about 10 cents per yard, and its\nwidth exactly equal to the height of the stands A number of large\nhooks must be obtained from the same shop, and sewn along one edge\nof the flannelette It remains only to hook the material to the cord, as\nshown in Fig It remains only to hook the material to the cord, as\nshown in Fig 2, in order to complete the barricade Fig 2 —Construction of barricade The entrance must now be artistically draped with curtains, after\nthe style of A, Fig The entrance must now be artistically draped with curtains, after\nthe style of A, Fig 1 It will then serve the additional purpose of a\n“stage,” upon which conjurers, jugglers, and other artists who do not\nwish the audience to see the back of their apparatus can perform The vexed question of “lights”—always a difficult problem in\namateur theatricals—need not here be considered, the gas or electric\nfixtures already installed being sufficient A circus is never complete without its horses, so attention must now\nbe paid to this department It is hardly practicable to turn several full-\ngrown animals loose in a circus constructed in an ordinary room nor\nis it probable that the reader’s purse will run to the importation of one\nor two Shetland ponies But a whole stud of “circus horses” may be\nobtained at small expense by carrying out the following directions Fig 3 —Showing outline of horse and part to be stitched Purchase three yards of cotton cloth, at 6 cents per yard Fold the\nmaterial in the center, thus making a double piece 11⁄2 yards long With a pencil or piece of chalk sketch the outlines of the head and\nback of a horse upon it, as shown in Fig 3 Then take a pair of\nscissors and carefully cut out the stuff The result will be two horse-\nshaped pieces of calico of exactly similar proportions At this stage, if the young showman is wise, he will place the\noperations in the hands of his mother or sister, for the two patterns\nmust be stitched together along the edges, to the points marked A and\nB, Fig 3 This done, the whole affair should be turned inside out Next obtain a quantity of rags or shavings, or purchase some\nexcelsior from an upholsterer’s, and stuff first the head and then the\nhaunches of the “horse ” The two unsewn pieces of cloth in the center\nremain empty One of them must be cut in half, and the two sections\nthus obtained folded and stitched into the form of two small bolsters\nand stuffed with flock (A, B, Fig 4) Fig 4 —Opening in horse for rider; tapes at A and B to be tied The remaining side should be similarly treated, only in this case it\nmust not be cut in half, but remain intact The result will be the head\nand haunches of a horse, with two “sausage-shaped” flanks in the\ncenter (Fig 4) Other Decorations\nThe “noble thorough-bred” is now ready for its final decorations Unravel some coarse rope and sew it along the neck of the horse to\nrepresent the mane Another piece, unraveled at one end only, does\nduty for a tail The ears are constructed by cutting a piece of calico,\nfolded in the form of a sugar bag, perpendicularly down the center,\nand stitching the two halves into position on the head The color of the horse must next be determined If dapple-gray, a\nfew ink blobs upon the white background will suffice; but if chestnut,\nbrown, or black, a distemper must be applied with a thick brush This\ndistemper can be made by mixing ordinary water color, of the shade\nrequired, with size water, and thickening with whiting When the distemper is dry, the “rider” of the horse must get into\nthe hollow in the center, and secure it to his hips by tying the tapes\ntogether at A, B, Fig",
    "When the distemper is dry, the “rider” of the horse must get into\nthe hollow in the center, and secure it to his hips by tying the tapes\ntogether at A, B, Fig 4 A “valance” of cretonne should then be sewn\ncompletely round the horse to hide the “rider’s” legs (Fig 5) A pair of\nreins, and two dummy legs stitched on the flanks complete the\n“mount ”\nFig 5 —Ready for the tournament It will be noticed that in Fig 5 the “rider” has a short skirt at the\nwaist of his coat or armor This is to hide the manner in which the\nhorse is attached to the “rider’s” hips, and the junction of the dummy\nlegs These horses can be used in numerous ways A very effective item\nin which they might be employed is a “tilting scene ” Two knights\nattired in armor—this latter commodity can be easily constructed, as\nit consists simply of back- and breast-plates made from painted\ncardboard, with a helmet of the same material—“canter” into the ring A clown follows them, also mounted, and carrying two long poles\nupon the ends of which are pads of rag, one covered with soot and the\nother with flour Fig 6 —Dummy horse for bareback rider The clown then proposes that they shall have a tournament, and\noffers to act as referee He thereupon hands them the poles, and,\nholding them as they would lances, the knights retire to opposite sides\nof the ring At a signal from the clown, the combatants dash towards\neach other, to commence the attack The self-constituted referee gets\nin the way, however, and comes in for a lot of hustling The knights\nagain retire, and once more advance to the attack But, as before, the\nclown becomes mixed up in the affray This occurs again and again Finally the two principals lose their temper and make a joint attack\nupon the referee Pursued by the irate knights, the clown dashes\nround and round the ring, making his horse gallop first backwards,\nthen sideways, and perform other ludicrous capers At length, daubed\nwith soot and flour from the knights’ “lances,” he darts precipitately\nfrom the ring There is another style of “horse” shown in Fig",
    "There is another style of “horse” shown in Fig 6 6 The carcase is\nmade in a manner similar to that already described, but in this case\nthe stuffing must be replaced by two men or boys, who crouch in the\nposition illustrated in the diagram It will be necessary, however,\nslightly to stuff the “horse” in such places as the head and haunches,\nin order to make it of correct shape The two men or boys must carry upon their backs an oval-shaped\npiece of board, having four “legs” nailed to its side, by means of\nwhich the carriers hold it firmly in position during the performance This is clearly shown in Fig 6 The purpose of the board is to make a\nflat and solid surface upon which the “daring bareback rider” can\nperform The performance consists of jumping over garlands and through\nhoops; leaping on to the back of the “horse” whilst it is at full gallop,\nand other of the more simple feats seen at circuses It is preferable, however, that the “bareback rider” should be a\nclown, who, instead of jumping the garlands, trips over them, and\nfalls headlong to the ground, completely misses the horse when\nattempting to leap upon its back, and lands on the ringmaster instead,\nthus making a travesty of the whole affair The next performance should be of a more serious nature Among the reader’s acquaintances is sure to be one who goes in for\ngymnastics, and he should be prevailed upon to give an exhibition of\nhis prowess upon the parallel bars, these being preferable to any other\napparatus on account of the small space they occupy To increase the\ninterest of the display, a clown should attempt to emulate each\nmovement as it is performed, but must fail miserably and come a\n“cropper” every time It is advisable to have a set of mattresses to\nsoften any unpremeditated falls How is it Done Another item suitable for the programme of the home circus is a\n“mock” conjuring entertainment The ring-master announces that Herr\nBluffemstein, the famous illusionist, will present his marvelous\nperformance Thereupon one of the boys or young men taking part in\nthe circus must stalk majestically into the ring, and bow stiffly to the\naudience If possible he should be attired in evening dress He should\nalso wear a fierce, upturned mustache, and carry an air-gun under his\narm A large target is then placed in the curtained entrance to the\nring This target consists merely of a wooden board containing several\nbent nails, upon which lighted candles are stuck Below each candle a\nlarge number is painted (Fig 7) “Herr Bluffemstein” then requests the audience to call out one of\nthese numbers Upon their complying, he loads the air-gun, raises it to\nhis shoulder, takes aim, fires—and the lighted candle over the chosen\nnumber goes out He repeats this marvelous feat of marksmanship\nseveral times Then, without warning, the remaining candles are\n\n\nsuddenly extinguished one by one, and a voice exclaims: “I say,\nmister, how much longer are you going to keep me blowing out these\nlights ”\nThe next moment a boy, wearing a glaring red wig, steps from\nbehind the target, where he has been engaged in blowing out the\ncandles through small holes bored exactly level with the wicks Fig 7 —Target for trick shooting After admonishing his assistant for having “given the game away,”\nthe conjurer tells him to fetch the apparatus for the next trick The\nboy retires, but shortly reappears with a tin kettle and a jug of water “Herr Bluffemstein” then proceeds to fill the kettle with water Having\ndone so, he holds it over his assistant’s head A few seconds pass, then\nsteam is seen to be issuing from the spout The illusionist hands the kettle to his assistant, with instructions to\ntake it away and fetch something else The boy, however, lifts off the\nlid, and placing his hand into the interior, draws out a piece of wire to\nwhich is attached a smoldering ball of brown paper The conjurer, enraged at thus having his second trick spoilt, chases\nhis assistant round the ring He at length gives up the chase as\nhopeless, and entices him to proceed with the next trick The boy\nagain leaves the ring; but soon returns with a slate, a slip of ordinary\nwriting-paper, a wet sponge, and a piece of brown paper The latter requires a little preparation before being used The\nconjurer and his assistant must fix upon a certain number—say 21—\nand write it reversely on the brown paper with a thick piece of chalk This, of course, must be done “behind the scenes,” and the assistant\nshould be careful that the audience do not catch sight of the figures\nwhen he enters the ring “Herr Bluffemstein” takes the slip of white paper, and hands it in\nturn to three people sitting in different parts of the room, with the\nrequest that each shall write a certain number upon it without letting\nhim know what has been written Whilst they are thus engaged he\nwipes the slate with the wet sponge, and proceeds to wrap it in the\nbrown paper, taking care that the chalked figures come in contact\nwith the middle of the slate Placing the parcel on the ground, he\norders his assistant to stand upon it The pressure thus applied will, of\n\n\ncourse, print the chalked figures on to the slate The conjurer then takes the paper from the member of the audience\nwho last wrote upon it Handing it to the boy, he instructs him to add\nup the figures, and read out the result The boy pretends to make the\naddition, but in reality calls out the number previously decided upon When the slate is unwrapped the audience are amazed to perceive\nthe apparently correct figures chalked upon it But before their\nastonishment has had time to abate, the assistant whips up the brown\npaper, and displaying the chalked figures to the audience, exclaims:\n“Why, sir, there’s still a lot more chalk to come off And do you know\nI nearly forgot the number I was told to call out",
    "And do you know\nI nearly forgot the number I was told to call out ”\nThere are numerous other tricks than can be adapted in the above\nmanner, but space will not permit further examples to be given It is a\ngood plan to finish up with a really first-class illusion, such as\nThe Indian Sack Trick\nIn this illusion the assistant brings forward a sack and proceeds to\nget into it The conjurer then seizes the top of the sack, and pulls it\nright over the boy’s head Producing a piece of rope, he requests some\none in the audience so to tie the mouth of the sack that it will be\nimpossible for the assistant to get out When this is done, the conjurer places a screen round the boy, and\nslowly counts “One, two, three ” As he utters the last word, he pulls\naway the screen The assistant is then seen to be perfectly free, with\nthe sack slung carelessly across his shoulder When the sack is\nexamined it is found to be still securely tied with the identical knot\nmade by the member of the audience The explanation lies in the fact that two sacks are employed The\nassistant has one secreted up his coat, and as the conjurer pulls the\nfirst sack over his head, the boy carefully pushes the top of the other\nthrough its mouth The conjurer hides the junction between the two\nby gathering the material together in his hand—apparently with the\nintention of making it more easy to tie Consequently the member\nfrom the audience unconsciously ties the mouth of the second sack\ninstead of the first All that is necessary for the assistant to do,\ntherefore, when the screen is placed round him is to scramble out of\nthe first sack, stuff it up his coat out of sight, then sling the other\ncarelessly over his shoulder Juggling is another performance eminently suitable for a show such\nas the home circus The only juggling the average person is capable\nof, however, consists in balancing a stick upon his finger, or keeping a\ncouple of balls in motion But the few hints given below will make it\npossible for any one to give a trick juggling performance after a few\nhours’ practice Trick Juggling\nFig 8 shows the first feat—that of balancing a stick, card, and\nwooden ball upon the hand The whole secret lies in the card It really\nconsists of two cards pasted together, with a piece of wire passing\ndiagonally between them and protruding about half an inch at each\nend In both the ball and stick are small holes into which this wire\nfits",
    "In both the ball and stick are small holes into which this wire\nfits The audience, of course, must be kept in ignorance of this—not a\ndifficult thing to do when several feet separate them from the\nperformer The audience, of course, must be kept in ignorance of this—not a\ndifficult thing to do when several feet separate them from the\nperformer Fig 8 —Balancing stick, card, and wooden ball Fig 9 —Two balls balanced upon stick The feat depicted in Fig 9 consists in balancing two balls upon a\nstick This is done by means of a wire constructed to slide up and\ndown in the center of the stick At first this wire is completely hidden,\nbut by pushing up the small handle the performer can make it\nprotrude from the extremity of the stick, and pass through small holes\nin the balls Of course, other objects may be made to balance by this\ndevice The juggler should also number amongst his apparatus several\ncardboard plates of the pattern shown by the three diagrams\ncomprising Fig 10 A segment must first be cut from a circular piece\nof cardboard, as shown by A The edges of this segment should then\nbe gummed together, the result being the conical contrivance seen in\nB Lastly, a circular cardboard ring must be fixed to the edge of this\ncone, C, and the plate is complete It is quite an easy matter to impart\n\n\na spin to these plates as they are thrown into the air, and then catch\nthem on the end of a stick, where they will rapidly revolve without\nthe possibility of falling",
    "It is quite an easy matter to impart\n\n\na spin to these plates as they are thrown into the air, and then catch\nthem on the end of a stick, where they will rapidly revolve without\nthe possibility of falling Fig 10 —Cardboard plate for spinning Fig 11 shows a method whereby a billiard ball can be made to roll\nalong the edge of a fan A piece of wire is hinged to the bottom of the\nfan, the other end protruding about one-eighth of an inch beyond the\nedge The billiard ball, which is partly pierced by a small hole, fixes\nupon this wire If the performer then places his forefinger in the small\nring made in the wire, and works it slowly backward and forwards,\nthe billiard ball will appear to be rolling along the edge of the fan Fig 11 —Balancing ball on fan Fig 12 —Trick cards An excellent series of tricks may also be performed by means of a\npack of cards, having each card joined together by a thin piece of\ntwine in the manner shown by Fig 12 12 Numerous other devices can be adopted by the juggler, and the\nsuggestions offered above may be enlarged upon considerably The\nmerest tyro in the “art of balancing” should thus be able to contribute\nan excellent item to the home circus Every owner of a dog has taught his pet at some time or another\nseveral little tricks The manager of the circus should therefore get\nthose of his acquaintances who possess dogs to combine in\ncontributing to the programme Then, again, a big dog might be clothed in a “bull’s skin” made\nfrom calico, and a farcical bull-fight arranged Here the circus\n“horses” could be once more employed to good purpose The “strong man” is a character always associated with circuses,\nand there is no reason why the home circus should not possess one The weights must be made from wood, painted black to represent the\n\n\ngenuine article After the “strong man”—who should be selected from\nthe most powerfully-built of the reader’s acquaintances—has lifted the\ndifferent “weights,” apparently with a great deal of exertion, he makes\nhis exit, leaving them upon the ground A little boy then enters, and\npicking up all the “weights,” walks unconcernedly from the ring As has been before mentioned, the home circus presents scope for\nalmost every kind of amateur performance, but it must be left to the\ningenuity of the reader to give further variety and make the\nprogramme as attractive as possible As a grand finale, a stirring, spectacular sketch should be given—\nsuch as an attack upon a settler’s hut by redskins, or a raid on the\nshanty of a miner The main idea in this sketch must be to make a lot\nof noise, blaze away with toy pistols at frequent intervals, and burn as\nmuch “colored fire” as possible The soldiers or mounted police should\narrive in the nick of time, of course, and drive the marauders\ncompletely from the field Thus everything ends quite happily CHAPTER XLIV\nHOW TO MAKE AND WORK A PEEP-SHOW\nAn Old Form of Entertainment Revived\nA peep-show makes an excellent and quite novel form of home\nentertainment, and a boy would be well repaid for any trouble to\nwhich the construction of one might put him The first consideration is the dimensions of the show One can be\nlarge enough to occupy the whole of a table, or so small that it can be\nmade from a soap or cigar box The best course, therefore, will be to\nleave the question of size to the reader Fig 1 is an illustration of the peep-show when finished Fig 1 —The finished show The first requisite is a wooden box of the shape shown in Fig",
    "The first requisite is a wooden box of the shape shown in Fig 2 2 As\npreviously mentioned, for a small show a cigar box does admirably If\nyou visit a friend who has just commenced smoking, and ask him for a\nbox, he will most likely bless you for the opportunity you have given\nhim of throwing away his horribly strong cigars Should no such\nfriend be numbered amongst your acquaintances, however, a\ntobacconist will be pleased to let you have one for a cent or so Having obtained the box, commence operations upon it First of all\none end must be entirely removed, not a very difficult task to\naccomplish The next thing to do is to make the peep-holes There is\nno fixed size for these They may be large enough for both eyes to be\napplied, or to permit only one to gaze through But provided they are\nof sufficient dimensions to allow the “audience” to obtain a\ncomprehensive view of the interior that is all that is required The number of peep-holes must, of course, be regulated by the size\nof the show If the reader possesses a fretsaw the making of the holes will\npresent no difficulty The best method to be adopted by those who\nhave not one of these useful instruments, is to make small holes in the\nnecessary places with a red-hot poker They can then be easily\n\n\nwhittled to the desired size with a penknife, the edges being finished\noff with a piece of emery paper Should the reader wish to make his\nshow “extra smart,” he can putty a piece of glass inside the box over\nthe holes But this is not essential Fig 2 —Showing back view of stage front and lighting Fig 3 —Candle stand and roof protector Next obtain a piece of cardboard, and from it cut out a stage front\nto fit the interior of the box, as shown in Fig",
    "Next obtain a piece of cardboard, and from it cut out a stage front\nto fit the interior of the box, as shown in Fig 2 This front must be\npainted in bright colors and glued inside the box about 31⁄2 inches\nfrom the end opposite to that at which the peep-holes have been\nmade The dotted lines in the illustration of the finished show (Fig 1)\nindicate the position of this stage front A reference to the same\ndiagram will also show a small door at the side of the show (D, Fig 1) This must next claim our attention This must next claim our attention Simply cut a small aperture about 3 inches wide by 4 inches deep,\nand hinge the oblong of wood thus obtained back into its position by\nmeans of a piece of linen and glue The object of this door is to enable\nthe showman to attend to the lighting of his show, done by means of a\ncandle, or, if necessary, two or three candles The lights are placed\nbehind the stage front in such a position that they are invisible to\nthose gazing through the peep-holes In order that the candles shall\nnot scorch the roof, they should be placed upon pieces of tin, bent to\nthe shape shown in Fig 3 The first portion of the show is now complete, and we will turn our\nattention to the second, and more important section Another raid must be made upon the tobacconist’s or grocer’s and a\nsecond box procured similar to the first It is necessary that this box\nshould be of the same width, and at least twice as high as the first is\ndeep This box is represented by B, Fig 1 Stand it on end and place the\nother against it in the manner shown by the diagram Now take a\npencil and mark a line across the second box at its junction with the\nfirst With a fretsaw or penknife make a cut along this line, and then\ncompletely remove the square of wood below this cut A glance at Fig 4 will make this clear Fig 4 —Scene-raising apparatus The back of the box must be taken off and hinged on again in the\nform of a door This is to enable the youthful showman easily to\nexecute repairs if anything “goes wrong with the works ”\nIt is now time to turn attention to the most important portion of the\nshow—the scenes If the reader possesses any artistic ability, he cannot do better than\npaint them himself A few hints upon this subject will perhaps be\nuseful He must pay a visit to a stationer’s, and purchase a supply of white\ndrawing-card, such as is used by artists A fair-sized sheet costs only\ntwo cents Having procured this he must lightly sketch, in pencil, the\nfirst scene upon it If he be at all doubtful as to his artistic abilities,\nhowever, the following is an excellent plan to adopt Armed with a pencil and piece of tracing-paper cut to the size of the\nscenes, he should carefully examine the various illustrations appearing\nin magazines A short search should reveal a mountain, a mass of\nfoliage, a waste of sea, or some other subject suitable for the\nbackground of the first scene He must then get to work with the\npencil and trace this upon the tracing-paper Another search will bring\nto light something adaptable for the middle-distance Lastly, a group\nof objects for the foreground must be selected, and the whole\ntransferred first to the tracing-paper and thence to the drawing-card Thus by taking a background from one illustration and a foreground\nfrom another, almost any scene may be built up After being sketched-in in pencil the scenes must be colored This\nshould be done with a view to general effect rather than perfect\ndetail First the predominant colors should be laid on in a bold wash,\nthen the objects in the background painted in The coloring must be\nas vivid as possible, in fact, almost gaudy Instead of each scene representing a single incident, it is preferable\nto weave the whole series into some sort of a narrative, such as “A\nVoyage round the World,” “With Shackleton to the South Pole,” or, if\nthe reader is very imaginative, “Round the United States in an\nAeroplane ”\n\n\nHaving procured the scenes—they can number from half-a-dozen to\na score—proceed to fix them in the show Fig 5 gives an interior view\nof scene-raising apparatus Fig 5 —Interior view of scene-raising apparatus A hole must first be bored in the center of each scene and pieces of\nstout thread knotted in them A series of diminutive wire-rings,\ncorresponding numerically to the number of scenes, must be fixed into\nthe roof of the box in the position indicated by the dots at A, Fig 4 Fig 5 shows position of wire-rings at A, B thread, and C loop for\nscene-raising The pieces of thread must be carried through the rings\nat A, bent at right angles at B, and brought to the outside of the box\nthrough a number of small holes (B, Fig 4) It will now be observed that when one of these threads is pulled,\nthe scene to which it is attached is lifted swiftly out of view of the\naudience and behind the top portion of the box In order to prevent the scenes and threads becoming entangled\nwhen raised and lowered, thin strips of wood should be glued up\neither side of the box, thus making a series of grooves in which each\nscene can work In Fig 4 the first scene has been raised, leaving one\nof these grooves displayed to view Another reference to this diagram (C, Fig 4) will show a number of\nsmall nails corresponding to the holes at B When a scene is pulled up,\nthe wire-ring at the end of the thread can be slipped over this nail,\nthus preventing its dropping down again It now remains only to put the two sections of the peep-show\ntogether This is easily done Simply push one box firmly against the\nother in the manner shown in Fig 1, and secure them either by means\nof small brads or strong glue The whole contrivance can then be painted and decorated to suit\nthe taste of the young showman, and everything is ready for the first\n“performance ”\nThe showman lights his candles, places the show upon the table in a\nconvenient position, and gets his “audience” to look through the peep-\nholes Then he starts upon his description of the first scene, making it\nas entertaining as possible by well padding with jokes When he has\n\n\nfinished with the first scene—Zr-r-rip —he pulls the thread, the\npicture is whisked out of the audience’s view before they quite realize\nwhat has happened, and the next scene is displayed Thus he will go through the whole series of pictures, and then—\nwell, after that, I trust he will be listening to the congratulations of\nthe audience upon his success as a peep-show man CHAPTER XLV\nTHE “MECHANICAL” PEEP-SHOW\nSecrets of Lightning Transformations\nThere is another variety of peep-show well worthy of attention It\nis known as the “mechanical” peep-show A short account of the\nfinished show will not be out of place before proceeding with a more\ndetailed description Upon looking through the peep-holes the interior of a cottage is\nperceived, including side wings The next moment, however, a faint\nclick is heard—and the interior of the cottage miraculously vanishes,\ngiving place to a scene in a forest glade The simplest and most satisfactory manner of explaining this\nmarvelous transformation is to describe how one of these\n“mechanical” shows may be made Procure a wooden box similar to the first of those employed in the\nmanufacture of the previous show Having decided upon the number\nof peep-holes, cut them out in the manner already described Another\n“stage front” must then be fixed in position about 3 inches from the\npeep-holes (Fig 1) For the sake of convenience it is advisable to turn\nthe box upside down, with the lid at the bottom instead of the top This will permit the interior of the show being attended to without\nunnecessarily disturbing the mechanism Having, for the time being, finished with the body of the peep-\nshow, turn your attention to the internal parts These are by no means\ncomplicated Fig 1 —Handles and tin clip for holding scenes First obtain a piece of white drawing-card, and cut it to fit exactly\nthe back of the box Then take another piece, half the size of the first,\nand hinge it by means of a strip of linen and gum to the center as\nshown in A A, Fig 2 With the flap thus formed hanging downwards, place the card upon\nthe table, and proceed to paint thereon a forest scene (C, Fig 2) If a\n\n\nsuitable illustration can be procured from a magazine it will only be\nnecessary to paste it on the card and carefully trim the edges Fig 2 —A double-barreled scene Having satisfactorily completed the forest scene, bend the flap\nupwards, thus hiding the picture, leaving in its place a blank piece of\ncard Brushes and paints must again be employed, and the blank card\ntransformed to the interior of a cottage The result is the “double-\nbarreled” scene represented by Fig 2 A glance at this diagram makes\nit apparent that by simply dropping down, or lifting up, the hinged\nflap D, the scene can be changed at the will of the operator Fig 3 is an example of one of the wings employed in the show Like\nthe scene, it is “double-barreled ” A strip of white cardboard is the\nfirst requisite Its size will be dependent upon the dimensions of the\nshow Fig 3 —Part of double-barreled wing Draw a line down the center of the card (Fig 3)",

    "1) This strip of\ntin is also shown at B, Fig 2 2 It will be found that when this is pushed\ndown, it clips on the flap D, holding it against C On being pulled up, however, the flap is released, and, falling\ndown, changes the picture To lift the flap again, attach a piece of\nthread to one corner, carrying the loose end out through a small hole\nin the back of the box The wings should be placed in the interior of the show, in the\nposition illustrated by Fig The wings should be placed in the interior of the show, in the\nposition illustrated by Fig 4 The wooden point at the base of each\nwing acts as a pivot in a small hole made in the bottom of the box Four corresponding holes must also be bored at the top The wire “handles” next claim attention They should be pushed\nthrough the small hole, as shown in Fig 1, and fixed firmly in each\nwing The holes must, in every case, be large enough to permit the\nwings to revolve easily and with the least possible resistance Each “handle” is connected by a straight piece of wire having both\nends bent in the form of a small ring (G, Fig 4) It will also be noticed\nin this diagram that one of these “handles” has a considerably longer\nshank than the others (H, Fig 4) This is to enable the showman to\nbring about the transformation previously explained Fig 4 —Simultaneous revolving wings",
    "—Simultaneous revolving wings A glance at Fig 4 will make it apparent that when H is turned, the\nfour wings revolve also Thus the wings for the forest scene may be\nsuddenly switched out of sight, and those for the interior of the\ncottage displayed, or vice versa, at the will of the operator To prevent\nthe wings revolving too far, a small block of wood should be nailed to\nthe bottom of the box at the base of the first wing, in the position\nshown by X, Fig 4 The mechanical peep-show is now finished After the showman has\ngrouped his audience at the peep-holes, and all is ready for the\ntransformation, he simply turns the wire handle with one hand, and\nwith the other simultaneously raises the clip securing the back scene All that is heard by those at the peep-holes is a faint click as the wings\nrevolve Then they perceive, with no little bewilderment, that in some\ninexplicable manner the interior of the show has been completely\nchanged The showman will be wise to refrain from permitting them\nfurther to examine the apparatus, however, for when they realize the\nabsurdly simple mechanism by which the transformation is wrought,\ntheir bewilderment will vanish even more rapidly than do the scenes\nthemselves CHAPTER XLVI\nHOW TO MAKE AND WORK A PUNCH AND JUDY SHOW\nHis Highness of the Hump\nMr Punch and Mrs Judy at one time held quite an exalted\nposition among forms of entertainment dear to the heart of the British\nboy As far back as the reign of Queen Anne, a well-known periodical\ndevoted quite a considerable space to a criticism of a Punch and Judy\nperformance",
    "As far back as the reign of Queen Anne, a well-known periodical\ndevoted quite a considerable space to a criticism of a Punch and Judy\nperformance Fig 1 —The framework Fig 2 —Frames hinged together Moreover, in England, less than fifty years ago it was no unusual\noccurrence for a traveling showman to hire a barn or large room and\ngive a whole evening’s performance with his Punch and Judy Punch is just as amusing indoors as out, and the boy who is\ninterested in giving different forms of home entertainment will find a\nPunch and Judy an excellent addition to his other shows The stage upon which Mr Punch performs his amusing antics is\nsimple of construction It will first be necessary to procure six uprights, each 7 feet long\nand 1 inch thick; and nine crosspieces each 21⁄2 feet long and 1 inch\nthick Take a pair of uprights and join them together with three\ncrosspieces—one at each end and the other in the center The result\nwill be a framework such as is shown in Fig 1 The four remaining\nuprights must be similarly treated Altogether three frames will have been constructed, and they must\nbe hinged together, as shown in Fig 2 Fig 3 —The platform This may be done with either strips of cloth or small metal hinges The latter may be purchased from any hardware store for a few cents The latter may be purchased from any hardware store for a few cents It will be noticed that the framework has only three sides The\nfourth side is to be occupied by Punch’s platform, which merely\nconsists of a small board about 6 inches wide and 2 feet 6 inches long An oblong nick 1 inch by 1⁄2 inch should be cut in each side of this\nplatform, as shown both in Fig 3 and A, Fig 4 A cut of similar\ndimensions must also be made 5 feet 6 inches from the ground in both\nthe front uprights of the framework (B, Fig 4) The incisions in the\nplatform dovetail into those in the uprights To make all quite secure\ntwo small catches (A, Fig 4) are fitted to the ends of the platform, and\nthese clamp round the uprights, holding everything firmly in position",
    "4) are fitted to the ends of the platform, and\nthese clamp round the uprights, holding everything firmly in position Fig 4 —Arrangement for supporting platform on frame The framework is now complete, and with the exception of the\nsmall space above Punch’s platform, should be covered with dark red\nor green paper cambric, which may be purchased at five or six cents a\nyard The width of the cloth will be found just over 2 feet 6 inches, i The width of the cloth will be found just over 2 feet 6 inches, i e the same width as a single frame The best course, therefore, will be\nto cut the cloth into seven-foot lengths and nail it with small tacks or\nbrads over each frame separately Fig 5 —Front of show complete The space below Punch’s platform, however, is covered in a\ndifferent manner A row of tacks or brads is driven into the front of the two uprights\nto about three-quarters of their length A corresponding number of\nsmall curtain rings—to be obtained at any hardware store for 5 cents\na dozen—are then sewn down the sides of a piece of the cambric 5\nfeet 6 inches long By this means the cloth may be hooked to the front\nof the show, as illustrated in Fig By this means the cloth may be hooked to the front\nof the show, as illustrated in Fig 5 5 Packing Up the Show\n\n\nWhen the Punch and Judy Show has to be packed away, it is merely\nnecessary to unhook the front cloth, take out the platform, and fold\nthe framework up as though it were a screen or a clothes’ horse But before this trial “pack up” is attempted, there are one or two\nsmall but important additions to be made First of all, the top of the opening at which Punch presents his\ncheery countenance must be decorated This is easily done Two small\nnails are driven perpendicularly into the top of the front uprights, and\na stout piece of wire stretched between them A frieze of cambric is\nthen hemmed round the wire (Fig 5)",
    "5) The wire should be simply\nhooked on the nails, so that it can easily be detached when the show\nis folded up A similar frieze must also be tacked along the edge of the platform With regard to the scenery Mr Mr Punch is very modest in this\ndirection, for he requires only two wings with which to garnish his\nabode These generally take the form of a scene of the top window of\na house, and the front of a shop or a portico The front and back of one of these wings are shown in Figs 6 and\n6a respectively It consists merely of a framework of wood, 11⁄2 feet long by 9\ninches wide, over which a piece of white cardboard is nailed or glued The desired scene is then executed on the cardboard in either oil\npaint, water color, or crayon The window itself should be cut completely out and hinged back\nagain with a strip of linen, so that Punch and the other characters may\npoke their heads through (Fig The window itself should be cut completely out and hinged back\nagain with a strip of linen, so that Punch and the other characters may\npoke their heads through (Fig 6a) 6a) The complete wings must then be hinged one on each side of the\nshow, as seen in Fig 7 In this diagram the wings are illustrated as\nseen from the inside Fig 6 —Exterior view of window —Exterior view of window Fig 6a —Back of wing Fig 7 —Swing-doors opening inwards The Puppets\nThe “stage” is now complete, and it remains but to make the\ngrotesque little puppets that perform upon it Pride of place must be given, of course, to the redoubtable Punch\nhimself The most difficult part of this puppet to construct is the head There\nare very few boys skillful enough to carve out the correct features\nfrom an ordinary block of wood; therefore they must find some other\nfoundation upon which to work A Dutch doll, to be purchased at any\ntoyshop for a few cents, serves splendidly Whilst the reader is in the\ntoyshop buying the one doll, he may as well extend his order to about\na dozen more; not only are they useful for making Punch, but their\nstony countenances can be transformed into those of Judy or any of\nthe other characters The dolls should all be decapitated, and have their hands and feet\nremoved as well One of the heads must then be selected, and the\nlittle snub nose taken off with a sharp knife A semicircular line\nshould next be penciled right across the lower part of the face, and all\nthe wood below this line cut away to the depth of 1⁄8 inch or so (Fig 8) A “false” chin is to go here, whilst a “false” nose must adorn the\nspot whence the original member was removed Fig 8 —Preparing Punch’s face Fig 9 —Punch’s nose and chin Both nose and chin can be whittled from separate pieces of wood—\nthe doll’s discarded body will do Fig 9 shows the shape they should\nassume When both have been carved to the reader’s satisfaction, they\nmust be glued firmly in their respective positions, and the joints\nhidden by a few judicious touches of the paint-brush Fig 10 —Pattern for Punch’s coat Fig 11 —Mr Punch In the case of the nose, a small tag of wood must be left, as in Fig 9, and a hole bored in the head to receive it This will make the joint\nmore secure than if it were simply glued, and as Punch’s nose receives\nmore than its fair share of knocks, the precaution of having it firmly\nfixed is not altogether an unwarrantable one The adjusting of the “false” nose and chin is by no means a simple\ntask, requiring, as it does, considerable ingenuity But on the whole it\nwill be found much easier than having to carve the entire face The clothing of Punch is best left in the hands of the reader’s\nmother or sister Although it is astonishing what a boy can do with\nneedle and thread when necessity puts him to the trial, making the\ntiny suit of scarlet calls for an amount of patience and a carefulness\nover detail that only a lady can be relied upon to exercise Fig 10 shows the pattern for Punch’s coat The cloth selected for\nthe garment must be folded double, cut to the pattern given, then\nhemmed round the edges as indicated by the dotted lines The sleeves\nare made separately, being afterwards sewn into position on the\njacket When the reader’s mother or sister has finished the little scarlet\ncoat, Punch’s head must be glued by its neck into the collar, a lace\nfrill being afterwards attached to finish off the joint neatly The hands\nfrom the Dutch doll should next be glued into the sleeves, and smaller\nfrills similarly attached Before the head is stuck in position, however, a hole must be bored\nin the base of the neck just large enough to admit the tip of the\nforefinger For Punch’s nether garments two cylinders of cloth only are\nnecessary The feet from the Dutch doll must be glued into one end of\neach cylinder, whilst the other ends should be sewn individually\ninside the front of the coat A conical hat must next be made, and either glued or tacked to the\nhead After the hump has been well stuffed with wadding, Punch\nshould have assumed an appearance similar to that of the gentleman\ndepicted in Fig",
    "After the hump has been well stuffed with wadding, Punch\nshould have assumed an appearance similar to that of the gentleman\ndepicted in Fig 11 Working the Figures\n\n\nTo “work” the figures the performer first puts his hand up the back\nof the coat, and sticks the tip of his forefinger in the hole in the head He then places his thumb and second finger in the diminutive sleeves By this means the puppet can be made to fling his arms about, and\nmove his head in a most grotesque fashion The other puppets are constructed on practically the same lines; but\nin the majority of cases it will be unnecessary to provide them with\nknickerbockers and legs, as the audience see only the upper part of\nthe bodies above the platform In these circumstances the attire can\ntake the form of a simple, long, loose gown, such as that worn by the\nClown in Fig In these circumstances the attire can\ntake the form of a simple, long, loose gown, such as that worn by the\nClown in Fig 12 Fig 12 —The Clown Fig 13 —Skull head for the Ghost Judy’s prepossessing features may be made from another of the\ndolls’ heads by substituting a beaked nose for the original organ The\nlady’s dress consists of a gown made from some red spotted material By a judicious application of paint, and by gluing on colored tufts of\nwood for hair, the remaining heads can be transformed into craniums\nsuitable for the other puppets The Ghost\nThe Ghost, however, may receive a little special treatment One of\nthe heads should be vividly painted in black and white to represent a\nskull Then attach it to a wooden stick, decorated with a series of\nblack rings, as shown in Fig",
    "Then attach it to a wooden stick, decorated with a series of\nblack rings, as shown in Fig 13 13 The body consists of a long white gown similar to the other dresses,\nthe only difference being that the head is left quite free in the collar When the mysterious visitor makes his first appearance his head is\nright down upon his shoulders, as in Fig When the mysterious visitor makes his first appearance his head is\nright down upon his shoulders, as in Fig 14 14 Directly Punch becomes too familiar, however, the showman can\nmake the Ghost suddenly shoot out his long neck, thereby giving the\nold gentleman a bad attack of the “nerves ”\nThere remains one other piece of “stage furniture” to be\nconstructed This is the gallows—which plays such an important part\n\n\nin the exciting scene where Punch turns the tables on Jack Ketch Take a piece of wood six inches long, half an inch wide, and an\neighth of an inch thick, and nail it at right angles to the extremity of\nanother piece the same width and thickness, only eight inches long A\nthird strip of wood must then be nailed diagonally between the other\ntwo The completed article will have the appearance of Fig 15 The end of the longer arm must be whittled to a blunt point, and a\nhole bored in Punch’s platform to receive it Two small holes should\nalso be bored in the short arm They must be about two and a half\ninches apart, and a piece of string knotted in the first, then looped\ndown and threaded through the second, as shown in the diagram It is\ninto this loop that the wily Punch persuades Jack Ketch to place his\nhead, when the old fellow gleefully gives a sharp pull to the other end\nand hangs him Fig 14 —Ghost as seen at first appearance Fig 15 —The gallows To those readers who do not possess a dog, at first sight Toby\npresents a difficulty which it seems impossible to overcome But all\nthat is necessary is to cut the head from a wooden toy dog and attach\nit to a stiff muslin gown, over which some black paint has been\nspotted to represent the tight skin of a mongrel terrier By placing the\nhand up the gown, this “Toby” can be worked similarly to the\npuppets Fig 16 —The squeaker Many professional showmen use what is known as a “Punch\nsqueaker” for imitating Mr Punch’s voice Most boys, with their well-\nknown genius for mimicry, will find it much easier to assume the\nhigh-pitched tenor of Punch without any artificial aid However, for\nthe benefit of those who are anxious to cheer the neighbors with the\ndulcet notes of the squeaker, instructions are given for making one First obtain a piece of tape six or seven inches long and half an inch\nwide; also two pieces of tin about two inches long and half an inch\n\n\nwide Both pieces of metal must then be bent slightly in the center,\nand a single layer of tape placed between them The remaining tape is\nnext bound firmly round the outside, all being held fast with thread The finished squeaker is illustrated in Fig 16",
    "16 Before being used it\nshould be well soaked in water To produce the required sound place the squeaker between the\nteeth, half speaking and half blowing the words through it The story of Punch is so well known that most boys will be able to\nwork out a performance of their own But those who wish to give the\ncorrect version of the adventures encountered by our Hero of the\nHump will find at any theatrical publishers’ a little book giving the\ncomplete dialogue CHAPTER XLVII\nDISSOLVING VIEWS\nWithout a Magic Lantern\nPrevious to the introduction of the cinematograph, dissolving\nviews ranked amongst the most popular of entertainments By means\nof a specially-constructed magic lantern, a painted picture from a\nglass slide is thrown upon a screen Then, at the will of the operator,\nthe picture apparently dissolves into a haze, through which a second\npicture gradually makes its appearance Subjects are usually chosen which specially adapt themselves to\nsuch an optical illusion For instance, a picture might be shown of a\nsmall country village, which slowly dissolves into a view of the same\nplace several years after, when it has developed into a thriving and\npopulous town But the specially constructed magic lantern necessary for these\ndissolving views is a very costly piece of apparatus, the purchase of\nwhich would entail the careful saving of two or three years’ pocket\nmoney However keen a boy may be to provide some form of home\nentertainment for the amusement of his friends, such an alarming\nprospect would make his keenness dissolve as completely as the\npictures he hoped to display Fig 1 —Show as seen by audience It is the purpose of this chapter, however, to explain how an\napparatus may be constructed for a small sum that will bring about\neffects similar to those of the special magic lantern costing many\ndollars Fig 1 depicts the show as seen by the audience It consists\nprincipally of a framework not unlike that of a model stage, the\ndimensions of which must be left to the decision of the reader For the\nsake of convenience, however, it will be advisable to explain the\nmethod of constructing apparatus capable of displaying views about\nthe size of a picture postcard A stage front similar to that in Figs 1 and 2 should first be cut from\neither thin wood or stout cardboard The size of a picture postcard is\nusually 31⁄2 inches by 51⁄2 inches Consequently the opening in the\nstage front must be about 61⁄2 inches by 81⁄2 inches This allows for a\nnice margin around each dissolving view It will be noticed from the diagrams that both sides of the show are\nfitted with two small rods, bearing miniature curtains These are to\nprevent the audience seeing what the showman is doing “behind the\nscenes ” Their mode of fixture is explained in Fig",
    "” Their mode of fixture is explained in Fig 3 Four pins, with\ntheir heads nipped off, are bent in the shape of a horseshoe, and a\npair driven into each side of the stage front (A, Fig 3) Fig 2 —Show from back view The two rods, which can consist of thin pieces of cane, are then\npushed into the sockets thus formed, and the curtains threaded upon\nthem by means of a wide hem sewn along the top The advantage of\nthis method of fixture is that when the show is packed up, the curtains\ncan be easily removed by merely pulling the rods from their\nhorseshoe-shaped sockets Fig 3 3 —Back view of partially constructed apparatus The floor or base of the show must next be provided Procure a\npiece of wood about 10 inches long, 1⁄8-inch thick, and of the same\nwidth as the stage front A block of wood is then nailed or glued along\none end of this, and the stage front fixed firmly to it (Fig 2) Having done this, make a journey to the nearest glazier’s, and\npurchase a piece of glass of about the same dimensions as the wooden\nbase This should not cost more than ten cents This should not cost more than ten cents Clean the glass\nthoroughly, and rest it against the top of the stage-front at an angle of\nabout 60° (Fig Clean the glass\nthoroughly, and rest it against the top of the stage-front at an angle of\nabout 60° (Fig 3) Next take a picture postcard, and lay it on the\nwooden base between the end of the glass and the stage front (See B,\nFig 3 )\nIf the room now be darkened, and a bright light thrown upon the\npostcard, its reflection will be clearly visible on the glass, and to those\nlooking through the stage front it will appear exactly similar to the\n\n\nview projected upon a screen by a small magic lantern Should the reflection be at all lopsided, the angle of the glass must\nbe altered until this defect is remedied A block of wood, or an\nordinary cigar-box, must then be placed upon the wooden base with\nits edge along the glass, and nailed securely in position",
    "A block of wood, or an\nordinary cigar-box, must then be placed upon the wooden base with\nits edge along the glass, and nailed securely in position (See A, Fig 4 )\nFig 4 4 —Showing position of picture postcard and glass screen Three pieces of cardboard are the next requisites One piece is to be\nglued to the block of wood or cigar box at the back of the show; the\nother along one side, and the last over the top, as depicted in Fig 4 It\nis now necessary to slide out the glass and paint the whole of the\ninterior dead black It\nis now necessary to slide out the glass and paint the whole of the\ninterior dead black Fig 5 —Lighting apparatus with serrated shutter Exhibiting\nWhilst the paint is drying the young showman can turn his\nattention to the lights These merely consist of two lamps—\nphotographic dark-room lamps are most suitable, or a wax candle will\nserve quite well Each lamp is provided with a cardboard shutter\nserrated at the bottom, as shown in Fig Each lamp is provided with a cardboard shutter\nserrated at the bottom, as shown in Fig 5 It is this serration that\nimparts the dissolving effects to the various views When the paint is dry the first exhibition may be given The room in which the entertainment is to take place must be\ndarkened; the glass placed in position between the cigar-box and the\nstage front, and the lamps lit Two picture postcards must also be\nobtained; the first being placed upright upon the cigar-box at the back\nof the show, and the other on the wooden base between the glass and\nthe stage front A glance at Fig 4 explains this The two lamps must now be so arranged that the light from one,\nwhilst brightly illuminating the first postcard, leaves the portion of\nthe show behind the glass in complete darkness; and the light from\nthe other falls solely upon the card on the cigar box If the shutter of the first lamp is now closed, and that of the second\n\n\nopened, the audience will see only the postcard at the back, set in a\nframe of dead black The exhibitor should then slowly press down the shutter of the\nsecond lamp, and simultaneously raise that of the first The serrations\n—in one case gently cutting off the light, and in the other permitting\nit to stream forth gradually—will have the effect of making one\npostcard slowly dissolve from view, and give place to the reflection of\nthe other The back of the show being in complete darkness, the glass acts as a\nperfect mirror, and whilst the audience are gazing at the reflection of\nthe first card, a fresh view may be substituted for that at the back,\nwithout their being aware of the change Having accomplished this, the showman must uncover the second\nlamp and push down the shutter of the first The result will be that\nthe reflected view fades from sight, and the fresh picture postcard is\ndisplayed It is then a simple matter to slip the card already used from its\nposition between the glass and stage front, and insert another in its\nplace In this manner a succession of views may be made to dissolve into\none another As has already been mentioned, there is no limit to the dimensions\nof such a show—the showman being guided by the size of the pictures\nhe is able to obtain Picture postcards are always procurable, and no\ndifficulty should be experienced in obtaining slightly larger views\nfrom magazines, art catalogues, &c Of course, in the very large shows a much brighter light is required,\nand four lamps must be used instead of two CHAPTER XLVIII\nINDOOR FIREWORKS\nWithout the Use of Explosives\nA firework display without the employment of brimstone and\nsaltpeter is somewhat unusual But it is quite possible to give such a\ndisplay, and to do so without the heavy expense usually attending\nFourth of July pyrotechnics It is first necessary to make a frame or “stage,” upon which to\npresent the firework display In appearance this frame greatly\nresembles a three-winged clothes-horse; in fact, one of these humble\nhome “thoroughbreds” may, after slight alteration, be easily pressed\ninto service",
    "In appearance this frame greatly\nresembles a three-winged clothes-horse; in fact, one of these humble\nhome “thoroughbreds” may, after slight alteration, be easily pressed\ninto service Fig 1 —Showing frame and side wings The question of dimensions rests entirely with the exhibitor Fig 1\nshows a diagram of the frame As will be seen, its front is divided into\ntwo compartments, A and B The lower compartment, B, is occupied\nby a scene of some Exposition Building This must be made of\ncardboard, and can either be permanently nailed to the frame, or so\nconstructed as to slide in and out between two grooves The\nadvantage of the latter mode of fixture is that when the owner of the\nfirework show tires of one scene he can readily substitute another To represent the windows and glass domes of the Exposition\nBuilding, small squares should be cut from the cardboard scene and\ntissue paper pasted over them When a light is placed behind, the\neffect will be very pleasing, and will considerably enhance the reality\nof the firework display After draping the two side wings (C and D, Fig 1) with red or green\ncloth, the framework or “stage” may be set aside, and attention paid\nto the fireworks themselves They are by no means of a character\ncalculated to send cold shivers down the backs of timid parents Fig 2\nshows a portion of one It simply consists of a piece of cardboard,\nslightly larger than the top frame (A, Fig 1) A design similar to that in the diagram must be lightly penciled\nupon it Then, with a rather coarse needle, prick out this design with a\nseries of small holes, through which the light can easily penetrate It is\nalso necessary to make four larger holes at each corner of the card,\nand to drive four wooden pegs or nails into the corresponding corners\nof the frame By means of these the cardboard design can be quickly\nremoved from or fixed to the “stage ” (See D, Fig 4 )\nFig 2 —Showing firework design formed by series of small holes Fig 3 —Revolving wheel, spaces fitted with colored tissue paper From another piece of cardboard cut out a wheel about 6 inches in\ndiameter, and of the shape shown in Fig 3 The numerous spaces\nbetween the spokes should be filled with pieces of transparent tissue\npaper of various colors A small stand upon which this wheel can revolve is the next\nrequisite This simply consists of a flat wooden base, with two wooden\nuprights glued firmly upon it These uprights are connected at one\nextremity by a short piece of wire—an ordinary pin will serve the\npurpose excellently—forming an axle for the cardboard to revolve\nupon Fig 3 makes this quite clear Now to test the effect of the first firework Fix the cardboard design in the upper portion of the frame, and\nstand the whole upon a table Then take a magic lantern (B, Fig 4),\nor, failing this, a bull’s-eye lantern or cycle lamp, and focus its rays\nupon the cardboard design Next place the “wheel” (C, Fig 4) in such\na position that the beam of light shines through one of the tissue\npaper films, and then continues its original course to the screen When everything is in position, the room in which the display is to\ntake place must be darkened Having done this, grip the edge of the\n“wheel” by the thumb and forefinger, and spin it sharply round Fig 4 —Firework apparatus complete As it swiftly revolves various colored beams of light will be thrown\n\n\nin rapid succession on the cardboard screen, and, penetrating the\nminute holes, will present the appearance of a fountain of brilliant,\nlife-endowed sparks The Firework Boxers\nBut our firework show gives scope for far better effects even than\nthis Some time ago great surprise was caused at an exhibition by the\nproduction of a firework boxer With a little care and ingenuity, the\nsame surprising result may be produced in the following\nmanner:—\nBy means of a needle prick out two boxers in a defensive position\n(C and D, Fig 5) The others must then be designed; only in this case,\none boxer is administering the coup de grace to his unfortunate\nopponent Two grooved strips of wood are next glued to the top and bottom,\nas shown at A, Fig 5, and two pieces of cardboard slid between them\n(B, B) These two cards should then be connected by three pieces of\nwire, as shown in the diagram, and have their corners rounded off in\norder to insure free movement in the grooves By pulling the left wire one pair of figures is hidden and the other\nrevealed Thus we have two firework boxers, who will fight a short\nbut decisive contest Fig 5 —The firework boxers There is another type of “indoor firework” working on the same\nprinciple as the above A reference to Fig 6 will put the exhibitor in\npossession of all its details Fig 6 —Another type of indoor fireworks with changing views At first only the central “Catherine wheel” is seen by the audience Then, on the wire to the left being pulled, and the cardboard to which\nit is attached raised, a fountain of fire shoots into the air and bursts\n\n\ninto a number of stars A similar occurrence takes place on the right,\nand by pulling the central wire the “Catherine wheel” is made\nsuddenly to vanish and give place to the spectacle depicted at D Care should be taken when manipulating these “mechanical”\nfireworks that the hand does not come between the light and the\nframework Of course, on the above principles, numerous other designs may be\nmade for the show, and a stock of “fireworks” manufactured that will\ndwarf any supply CHAPTER XLIX\nHOW TO MAKE A TELEPHONE\nFor Use at Home\nIt is quite easy to make a telephone, which besides affording\namusement, will, at times, be found extremely useful Fitted from the\nground floor to the rooms above, or from your friend’s house to your\nown, it is impossible to overestimate its convenience Fig 1a —Section of case Of course it is quite possible to buy the parts of a telephone ready\nmade and fitted together, but it is much more interesting to construct\nthe apparatus yourself The whole affair is so easily and cheaply made that no difficulty can\npossibly be experienced, and you have only to exercise care in order\nto succeed in constructing a very handy and interesting machine Fig 1b —Magnet case",

    "The slightest fault will\ncertainly spoil the whole instrument, and the least carelessness render\nall the labor expended utterly useless Now to describe the simplest way to make a receiver and\ntransmitter Three pieces of wood will be required, a cigar-box furnishing the\nbest material for the purpose; if you have not one at home, any\ntobacconist will let you have one for a few cents To commence with the base Cut a piece of wood measuring 6\n\n\ninches by 5 inches In this two grooves must be made (D D and E)\naccording to the measurements shown in A, Fig 1 The width of these\ngrooves must, of course, depend upon the thickness of the wood, for\nthe dial and the upright will have to be fitted into them The width of these\ngrooves must, of course, depend upon the thickness of the wood, for\nthe dial and the upright will have to be fitted into them A —Base of instrument B C —Upright Fig 1 For the dial you will require a piece of wood similar to the base, but\nmeasuring 5 inches by 4 inches One end of this should be rounded as\nshown in B, Fig 1 Drill a hole (F) right through this dial, 3 inches\nfrom the bottom and 21⁄2 inches from either side As a piece of wire\nwill have to revolve easily in this hole, take great care to cut it\ncleanly In the lower end of the dial cut out two notches (G H), each\naccording to the measurements in B, Fig 1, i e 3⁄4-inch deep and 1⁄2-\ninch wide Each notch must be 3⁄4-inch from its side of the dial The upright is very easily made, being simply a strip of wood 31⁄2\ninches by 1 inch (C, Fig 1) In this drill a hole (K) 3 inches from the\nend and 1⁄2-inch from either side, taking the same care as with the\nhole in the dial Having thus prepared the several pieces of the framework, the dial\nshould be glued into its groove A small square block of wood glued\ninto the angle formed by the base and the dial will insure the latter’s\nbeing perfectly perpendicular The upright will be fixed in its place\nlater To proceed with the more delicate part of the work Cut a piece of\ncardboard, fairly thin in texture, 5 inches long and 1 inch wide, and\nbend it into the shape of an oblong hoop Upon the hoop or bobbin\nwind about half an ounce of fine cotton-covered copper wire, size No 36, which can be obtained from any electrician Wind this wire very\ncarefully and evenly, but not tightly, leaving about 4 inches free at\neither end (A, Fig",
    "Wind this wire very\ncarefully and evenly, but not tightly, leaving about 4 inches free at\neither end (A, Fig 2) 2) The next thing to be made is a magnetized needle, which can be\neasily done as follows Take a piece of ordinary watch spring, an inch\n\n\nlong, and make it red hot When in this condition drill a hole through\nthe center, and when it is cooler round the ends, as in B, Fig 2 Heat\nit once more to a red heat and then plunge into cold water to harden The needle must now be magnetized by being drawn several times\nfirmly across the pole of a strong magnet, care being taken that it is\nalways drawn in the same direction The pointer (C, Fig 2) should be made in a similar manner, except\nthat it must not be magnetized, and should be at least twice as large\nas the needle Through the hole in the magnetized needle pass a\ncouple of inches of straight stout wire, and with a little solder, or even\nsealing-wax, fasten the needle as shown in B, Fig Through the hole in the magnetized needle pass a\ncouple of inches of straight stout wire, and with a little solder, or even\nsealing-wax, fasten the needle as shown in B, Fig 2 A —Coil of wire B —Magnetized needle C Pointer Fig 2 All these parts can now be fixed together In the middle of the\nbroad side of the coil of wire you must push aside the strands in such\na manner that holes can be made through the cardboard hoop Pass\nthe two ends of the thick wire, to which the needle is attached\nthrough these holes, so that the needle is then suspended within the\ncoil Take care to make these holes large enough to allow the axles of\nthe needle to revolve freely, as the whole success of your apparatus\ndepends upon the needle turning easily within the coil, which should\nnow appear as in Fig",

    "2 The Physiological Method—that steeps the faculties in oblivion as\ncompletely as when chloroform is administered This latter form is often used as a therapeutic means of securing rest\nand relief from pain It has been proved that individual character\ntakes a far greater part in the mental method than the physiological When an object is used to induce hypnosis, it is held at a distance of\nabout eight inches from the eyes, and removed gradually to a foot\nabove the forehead (Fig 1) During this process the gaze should follow the slowly moving object\nuntil the lids are strained to their widest extent (Fig 1a) This position\nnaturally fatigues the eyeballs and causes the lids to close swiftly Fig 1 —Range of object to induce hypnotic sleep Fig 1a —Gazing with eyelids open to widest extent It is not essential that a glittering object be used It has been found\nthat the finger of the operator, moved gradually, is as successful a\nmeans as any object Should the hypnotizer desire to enforce slumber,\nhe may accompany his action with suggestions that the subject is\nextremely tired and longing for sleep “You are worn-out Your head is heavy Your limbs are fatigued You need rest Sleep is essential You are gradually falling asleep ”\nBefore hypnotism can take place, the patient makes his mind a\nperfect blank, and concentrates his whole being and vision on the\nbutton, coin, glass, or crystal held before him It will now be seen that\nhis eyes begin to water, the pupils undergoing a series of changes,\ncontracting, dilating, and recontracting, as if he were succumbing to\nnatural slumber His sight becomes gradually insensible to the light,\nand in a few moments he is unconscious The state of hypnotism begins with the second narrowing of the\npupil, and is accompanied by a quickening or retarding of the pulse,\nrigidity of body and heaviness of brain, which becomes chaotic and\nwildly confused before the final stage is reached The will is entirely\nsurrendered to the hypnotizer, and the subject is powerless to move,\nspeak, or feel, except at his suggestion A sure test that the individual experimented upon is really oblivious\nto everything about him is shown when the operator gently moves his\narms from his side in a horizontal position and lifts his eyelid When\nthe arms remain rigidly outstretched and the eyeball is fixed and\nglassy, the exponent is assured that his subject is completely at his\nmercy (Fig 2) In order to bring about this condition successfully, the hypnotizer\nmust possess no small amount of cultured will-power and\nconcentration His mind must be absorbed in the experiment as\nwholly as the subject’s faculties are concentrated upon him He is now\nforcing his brain to act at his dictation, not only upon his own\nmovements, but upon those of the individual chained to him by his\n\n\nexertion of hypnotic influence One mind operates them both, and,\nduring his subject’s trance, he has as complete a sway over his\nnervous system as if he possessed two bodies and a double supply of\narms and legs Fig 2 —The subject, when hypnosis is complete The eyes, whether closed or widely open, are focused on his brain,\ninsensate of everything beyond the compelling force creating his\nthoughts He can hear sounds, smell, taste, see, talk, or remain silent\n—only in obedience to that petrifying will Of every movement of our bodies, the brain is supreme operator The code of suggestion is flashed through telegraph wires composed\nof nerves and muscles No turn of the head, twitch of the finger, beat\nof the heart, can take place without the coalition of those wonderful\nbrain-cells When an individual is stricken with paralysis, and has lost\nall power over his limbs, it is not because his bodily organs are\ninjured Impotence is caused by the fact that his brain has lost its\nability to exert its power over his organs The wheels of a brain, however carefully oiled and cleaned, remain\nmotionless unless the engine fires are lit; and, in hypnotism,\nhelplessness is not brought about by the mastery of the exponent over\nevery separate joint and muscle (for it would be absolutely useless,\neven were it possible, for him to concentrate his attention on every\nminute movement of the body), but simply because he is robbing the\nbrain of its individual control, and is exerting his own will to\ndominate the purpose and identity of his subject as relentlessly as the\nmagnet dominates the needle Weak-willed Subjects not Essential\nSome subjects are less amenable to hypnotic influence than others The belief that those of weak will are the easiest prey is a fallacy The real reason lies in the fact that the individual is incapable of\nconcentrating his will in obedience to the dominating mind This is\ngenerally the case with persons inclined to hysteria or of neurotic\ntemperament, and for such, a revolving glass is the best object to be\ngazed upon, as it wearies the eye and induces slumber without the\n\n\nneed of concentration or surrender of will There are others who cannot easily be hypnotized because they\ndeterminedly set themselves to oppose the purpose of the operator to\nsuch an extent that his brain becomes exhausted in the process and\nloses its potency In such cases the best plan is for the hypnotizer to\ninspire faith by means of experiments performed over other\nindividuals in the presence of the resisting or cynical, until the\nincredulous are convinced that the hypnotic influence is not induced\nby trickery or confederacy The influence of imitation is an important\nfactor in hypnotism, and faith once founded does a great deal to\novercome defiant wills It has been found that some of the best results have been those\nwhen the subject is taken completely by surprise The motion of the hands often brings about unconsciousness as\nswiftly as when an object is used The hypnotizer should stand a few\npaces from the subject, gaze into his eyes, and with hands raised\nsweep them gently in continual passes over the body, reaching from\nabove the head to below the hips This action should be continued\nwithout a pause for some minutes, the hands sweeping across the face,\nas near as possible without touching it (Fig 3) The motion may also\nbe performed at the back of the subject (Fig 3a) Fig 3 —Motion of hands “before” subject Fig 3a —Motion of hands “behind” subject The body will gradually sway backwards or forwards, the gaze\nbecome fixed and lifeless until the subject’s will is surrendered, when,\nby withdrawing a few paces and raising a finger, the exponent will be\nable to draw him in any direction he wishes The power of hand motion has been explained as due to stimulation\nover those zones of the body most susceptible to hypnotic influence,\nor the slight motion of the air, or mental influence It is probable that\nall these influences combine, the most important being the mental\ninfluence The idea that the hypnotizer possesses some magnetic fluid which\npasses from him to the subject in the process of hypnotism has been\n\n\nproved to be without any foundation, and is merely a foolish\nsuperstition There is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the\ninfluence of this power It is due entirely to the exertion of mental\nforce and the involuntary co-operation of the individual hypnotized Performance of hypnotism in a drawing-room is not difficult,\nalthough, like everything else, it needs practice and perseverance\nbefore it can be successfully accomplished; and, unless the mind of the\nhypnotizer is disciplined to determination and control, it naturally\nfails to act upon other minds Now, provided that the student has some knowledge of the subject,\nand has trained himself to keep his attention fixed, to the exclusion of\neverything else, upon the matter in hand, a few experiments may be\nundertaken Elementary ones should be essayed at first Fix upon an individual among your onlookers Ask him to withdraw\nfor a moment or two, while you and your friends decide what he shall\naccomplish However simple the action, every mind must be\nconcentrated upon it, and there must be no laughing or talking If you know something of the character and temperament of the\nsubject chosen, this will aid you considerably He should have faith in\nyour power, and willingly surrender his will to your control As an aid\nto concentration, request him to close his eyes; or, better still,\nblindfold them Next turn him round several times, taking care not to\ninduce giddiness Your only reason for doing this is to shut out all\nobjects that may draw his thoughts from your purpose Place the tips of your fingers lightly on his shoulders, but do not\npush him forward (Fig 4) He must move only when he feels the\nimpulse of your will impelling him with sufficient force to render\nresistance difficult or impossible He will probably stand motionless\nfor a few moments, and this is when spectators are inclined to giggle a\nlittle, just as when, for no particular reason, one’s risibilities are\nstirred while being posed before a camera If, however, the slightest sound intrudes upon the silence, the\ngrowing spell will be broken, for it at once disturbs the train of\nthought surrounding the subject, and draws his attention from your\nwill Silence is absolutely essential, for it has almost as powerful an\ninfluence as the strongest will This gained, you will feel your subject sway a little under your\nfingers before he goes slowly and unhesitatingly forward, feeling his\nway with outstretched hands, and walking with the peculiar tread of a\nsomnambulist, until he unerringly picks up the photograph, takes a\n\n\npin from the curtain, removes a flower from a vase and places it in his\nbutton-hole, or any other trivial act you have fixed upon Then he will\npause, as if in relief that the deed is accomplished Fig 4 —Inducing hypnotic sleep Only one action should be decided upon at a time—the simpler the\nbetter to begin with As you excel in this form of hypnotism, you may try more\ncomplicated experiments, but not until you have overcome the\nrudimentary difficulties and have developed your powers to such an\nextent that you have absolute faith in your ability, for self-reliance\nand self-confidence are the corner-stones of hypnotism Auto-Suggestion or Self-Hypnosis\nIn order to cultivate these, experiment upon yourself by the means\nof auto-suggestion or self-hypnosis, which is a splendid means of\ntraining those faculties necessary to the mastery of other minds Change your state by means of words which imply a condition\neither mental or physical not personally experienced by you, and\nbelieve implicitly in your own ideas Treat yourself exactly as if you\nwere experimenting on another individual, surrendering your\nsubjective and objective mind wholly to absorb the idea conveyed,\nand gradually its meaning will influence and take possession of your\nbrain to the exclusion of everything else The change suggested should be exactly opposite to your natural\nstate—for instance, if you are warm, tell yourself determinedly that\nyou are cold until you credit the fact, when your body, which blindly\nfollows mind and will, experiences the sensation of cold If you have a headache, suggest that the pain has gone, &c Auto-\nsuggestion may be perfected to such an extent, that, under its\nhypnotic trance, a needle may be plunged into the skin without the\naction’s causing the slightest degree of pain In suggestion, it is always the subjective mind that is swayed by\nhypnotic influence This is always keenly alive, and it is through its\nmedium that the subject is induced to an extraordinary power of\nimagining and experiencing the processes suggested by the\nhypnotizer Elementary exhibitions are very entertaining, and are quite\nsufficient to illustrate the motive power which achieves your purpose Some individuals are better hypnotists than others, because they have\na natural supply of animal magnetism at their disposal, but it is\nextraordinary what results can be brought about by study and\npatience, so that students less gifted need not despair of success For the sake of those who have succeeded in such simple\nexperiments as the foregoing, the following may be undertaken In\nthese, intuition, sympathy, and imagination play almost as important\na part as thoughtful concentration, which is ever the most powerful\npossession in the outfit of the hypnotizer Here, one word as to the difference between the terms hypnotist and\nhypnotizer The former is a scientist, who employs his art solely for\ntherapeutic or medicinal purposes The latter is the entertainer, and\ncare should be taken to distinguish between the two words Experiment —Place the subject in a chair, with palms on knees Pass\nyour hands over him for a space of several minutes, the while his eyes\nare fastened on your own Watch his expression carefully It\nundergoes several changes, the individual character dominating (Fig 5), gradually disappears, and finally gives place to vacancy (Fig 5a) The firm lines of the mouth fade, and the lips become slightly parted The face grows blank and purposeless, the eyes staring and void You have some plan in your mind which you are straining to\nimpress on his brain Supposing it is that he shall not remove his\nhands from his knees Say to him, in a low soothing voice, which\npenetrates his hearing perfectly (to shout, breaks the spell in a\nmoment), “Your hands are stuck to your knees; you cannot remove\nthem They’re glued; they’re tight fast Do what you will, you can’t lift\nthem Now try——”\nFig 5 —Face showing character before hypnotic sleep Fig 5a —Face showing vacancy under hypnotic sleep At your dictation he endeavors to do so He lifts his knees He ducks\nhis head, trying to push his hands away by means of his chin, but\nevery effort is futile until you say, “You can now remove your hands See, it is quite easy, they are free ” At once he lifts them easily Now ask him his name He tells you in a dazed, obedient voice that\nit is “John Jones ” You determine he shall forget his name You say to\nhim again and again, “You have forgotten your name You cannot tell\nme what it is You don’t know your own name; you can’t remember ”\nThe subject’s face at once indicates that he is absolutely nonplused He struggles to remember, but in vain Should you suggest that his\nname is Mary Smith, he will believe you implicitly, and, with a\nrelieved expression, declare this name to be his own Bid him open his mouth as wide as he can Then say to him, “You\ncan’t shut your mouth",
    "Then say to him, “You\ncan’t shut your mouth It is fixed, rigid Try to shut it ” He vainly\nendeavors to do so He places one hand on his head, the other on his\nlower jaw, and tries to force his lips together, but he is powerless so\nlong as your will opposes him When you command him to shut his\nmouth, he does so without effort A subject should not be kept longer than a few moments in this\nsubservience to your will He can be released by a snap of your fingers\nat his ears or before his eyes Address him softly by his name, and he\nwill return to consciousness in an instant When he looks dazedly\nround, reassure him, kindly, that he is quite well, and will suffer no\nharmful results from your experiments Fig 6 —Awakening the subject The hypnotizer should never abuse his power over an individual He must possess sufficient humanity to prevent him from keeping his\nsubject too long under control When he finds a subject who answers readily and quickly to the\nhypnotic influence, he may be tempted to continue an exhibition of\nhis powers in order not to lose time on less amenable individuals, but\nhe should determinedly resist this temptation A valuable aid for him will be to time his experiments by a watch,\nlimiting each individual’s trance to a space of, at most, four minutes’\nduration The hypnotizer must be in perfect health, for, unless his body,\nnerves, and mind are in proper condition, the supply of animal\nmagnetism fails He must study hygiene, take sufficient exercise, and\nbe most particular to keep his body, linen, hair, and finger-nails\n\n\nscrupulously clean A dirty finger, held up before a subject undergoing the hypnotic\ntrance, inspires the latter with a revolting sense of disgust, and clouds\nthe vision conjured by the brain The hypnotic entertainer should abstain from any indulgences, and\neat only plain, wholesome food During the process of hypnotism, the\nexponent should never lose his head or self-reliance Any dread\nexperienced by him is at once conveyed to the subject Should the\nlatter be unable to awake from the trance at command, the operator\nmust wave his handkerchief before his eyes If these are closed and\nrefuse to open, he must at once rub the eyebrows with the tips of his\nfingers, beginning at the root of the nose, and ending at the temples,\nterminating this action by gentle fanning or blowing until such efforts\nmeet with success (Fig 6) It should always be remembered by the student that the power of\nhypnotism—like fire—is a good servant, but a bad, tyrannical, and\nlawless master, unless properly controlled CHAPTER LII\nTHE POWERS AND MYSTERIES OF CLAIRVOYANCE\nMarvels of the “Sixth” Sense\nClairvoyance, originally a French word, means the ability to see\nclearly The reason so few people possess this extraordinary psychic\nfaculty, is because most human beings are three-quarter parts blind,\ndeaf, and insensate to anything beyond the ordinary emotions The power of prophecy and acute intuition is a sixth sense which\nmost of us have in a slight degree dormant and uncultivated Clairvoyance has often been mistaken for superstition or wilfully\nimposed and cunning deceptions, and it is difficult for ignorant and\ncynical people to believe that it is founded on science and truth It has stood firm through the ages in spite of the quackery of\nwizards, paraphernalia of sorcerers (used to inspire fear and awe in\nthe uninitiated), the sneers of those of material minds All of us at\nsome time or other have felt the control of that still small voice,\npotent and penetrating as conscience, which comes, unaccompanied\nby earthquake or fire, to instill us with awe, joy, extreme sadness, or\nwarning at some critical juncture of our lives; often anticipating, with\npower greater than speech can convey, some event that concerns our\nwell-being Why this power should be deemed more extraordinary or\nmysterious than the senses of sight, hearing, smell, and touch which,\neven to those thoroughly conversant with the anatomy of the human\nbody, remain steeped in mystery, it is difficult to say Science teaches that a million delicate sounds escape the ear and\nbrain, and as many minute exquisitely fashioned atoms escape the\neye A magnifying glass reveals the marvelous structure of insects and\nmicrobes invisible to naked sight, and it is only by means of a\ntelescope that the beauty of the stars is discerned; thus the developed\npower of clairvoyance may be called the magnifying lens of the soul It is because this lens is dull and misty that we fail to see The history of ages and a great deal of our most cherished literature\nprove its existence Many of the stories and prophecies of the Bible are founded on\nclairvoyance People were simpler and more trusting then; for this\nreason visions and clear sight were granted them Pilate’s disregard of the warning conveyed in his wife’s dream,\naffected the whole course of Christianity, and the Bible abounds with\nexamples of the disasters that befell those who disobeyed the spiritual\npromptings sent them This wonderful faculty of inner sight is the possession of the\nindividual born blind He demonstrates its existence when by merely\npassing his fingers over an object he can describe exactly a color he\nhas never seen In him it is nature’s recompense, and no one who\nwatches his movements can doubt that he is guided by this psychic\norganism, yet when we note the same power granted to a man or\nwoman blessed with eyesight, we at once decide that happy\ncoincidence, trickery, or charlatanism is the origin of the\nmanifestation Clairvoyance teaches that everybody has a distinctive color, which\nconveys more of character and personality than any word or action The shades of these colors vary according to temperament, and are as\nmuch concealed from untrained vision as the million tints composing\nthe gold, purple, and green bands of the rainbow Optimistic persons emanate a pale blue aura Large-minded progressive persons, a pale green Pessimistic worried persons, gray Ill-health in mind or body, dark green Kindly benevolent, humane persons, pink The thinker and scholar, deep blue The degraded, brown The passionate and bad-tempered, red The ambitious, orange The lover of the beautiful in Art, yellow Keys to Character\nThese colors, however, although providing the key to the character,\nare subject to constant changes Our moods sway and change our\nthoughts according to the happenings that affect us For example, bereavement or anxiety has power to transform the\nblue aura of the optimistic temperament to gray, and this temporary\n\n\nchange of color studied alone may perplex the clairvoyant, and\nmislead him to a false diagnosis of character In order to prevent this, the seer will do well to request some article\nconstantly worn by the inquirer to be handed him; the older and\nshabbier it is the better A dilapidated glove, an everyday tie or a ring\nconstantly worn are equally valuable by which to discriminate\nbetween the temporary and habitual aura peculiar to temperament When a man’s glove emits a pale blue aura, in contradiction to the\ngray of his own personality, the deduction is that he is naturally of a\nhopeful and cheerful tendency, but that some mental anxiety or\nbereavement causes the gray, deep or pale, according to the depth of\nemotion dominating him The reason of this difference of colors is that the glove is, as it were,\nsaturated with the essence of his normal disposition, while the color\nof his character has been changed by circumstances or environment In the brain there exists a small and delicate organ known as the\npineal gland, and it is thought by some scientists that this is\nresponsible for, and sensitive to, the subtle vibrations of ether which\nare too minute to stir the tympanum of the ear Its cultivation\nproduces the power that beholds and distinguishes the difference in\nshades of mental color in which the mind is absorbed People of erratic temperament possess an aura of many and\nconstantly changing colors, but those whose calm never varies\nmaintain but one Some few persons are aware of the tones of their aura, and are\ntherefore keenly sensitive to the influence of their surroundings They will be perfectly miserable if the paper on their walls, or the\nmaterial of their clothes, clashes in color with that of their character;\nwhile they are at their best and happiest surrounded by the tints that\nblend or contrast harmoniously The clairvoyant’s outfit consists of six\nqualities:—\n1 Power of magnetism 2 Mental health and influence 3 Physical health and cleanliness 4 Temperance in food and drink 5 The power of discerning the aura and interpreting its\ncolors 6 The liberty from all evil or slothful habits In advanced clairvoyance the use of the crystal for vision is\ndesignated by many seers as “clap-trap” and vulgar “playing to the\ngallery ” It is found to be injurious to eyesight and brain centers to\ngaze at any shining article for too long a period, yet in parlor\nclairvoyance there is no doubt that it has great power of inducing\nconcentration of sight and thought Crystal Gazing\nBy means of crystal scrying the gazer creates and becomes subject\nto the influence of auto-hypnosis—that is, he is able to throw himself\ninto a trance which veils his own personality and links him to that of\nhis client The surface of the crystal gradually reflects images, and\nsubconscious impressions conveyed by and vital to the individual\nwhose past, present, and future are being revealed Sympathy and intuition merge the soothsayer’s aura with the\ntemperamental coloring of his client His magnetic force creates\nfurther powers, while his psychic discernment or sixth sense is the\nnucleus about which these are bound No student of clairvoyance can be successful in discerning character\nand personal emanations of color unless he is disciplined by simple\nrules which should govern his life Excessive eating, drinking, intemperance in any form, self-\nindulgence, bad habits, and drugs destroy this delicate sixth sense past\nredemption Want of sincerity and integrity results in the rapid decline of its\npower The body and mind must be pure and of perfect mental and\nphysical balance No nervous fretting or pettiness of outlook should be\npermitted to intrude In clairvoyance the brain is ruled by large and lofty aims, and it\nmust be kept as unspotted and clean as a white garment; so only is it\ncapable of performing its proper functions Likewise it is essential to remember the important, nay, vital\ndominion it exerts over the body, which cannot rise to perfect beauty\nand health unless its mental orbit is lofty and serene In consulting a clairvoyant the client should be serious, earnest, and\n\n\ntrustful that he will hear the truth Frivolity, incredulity, or idle\ncuriosity forms as it were a thick crust between the mind of exponent\nand inquirer, which prevents the penetrating of thoughts and vision,\nstrains the powers, and results in disappointment In the same spirit in which one visits a doctor or solicitor should the\nclairvoyant be approached, and there must be no determined reserve\nto conceal thoughts and character in the mind Clairvoyance in a drawing-room full of people is extremely difficult\n—indeed impossible, unless the onlookers can be induced to keep\nperfect silence during the operation It is always better to be closeted alone with the inquirer in a small\nroom to which street noises do not penetrate, provided only with the\nnecessary furniture, kept clean and fresh, airy, and well lighted The crystal should never be touched by any one save the\nclairvoyant, and must be kept free from spots and smudges A black\nsilk handkerchief round its globe will be a help to divination by\npreventing the reflection of lights There may be, especially to beginners, temptations to pose as the\npossessor of supernatural powers—to make passes over the crystal,\nlight wax tapers, burn perfumes, and murmur incantations—but these\nmethods, although employed by the ancient prophets, are of no aid to\nthe modern sage Indeed, they do harm by appealing to the senses and\nsuperstitions, and, being a mere affectation, are unworthy of that sixth\nsense and harmful to it Simple Manifestations Best\nThe simpler the manifestation, the more assured the clairvoyant\nmay be of arriving at the truth Self-confidence, an absolute belief in his gift, and faith in his\nmethods dominate him He does not endeavor to avoid exertion of his nervous forces by\ndiscreetly “pumping” the inquirer as to ways and means, but takes a\ndelight in silent investigation The clairvoyant should come to his task fresh and buoyant,\nbubbling with enthusiasm, and yet without frivolity or thoughtless\nmind At the slightest sense of fatigue he should desist from his\nefforts, for it is extremely harmful to apply any force or strain to this\nabstract power Physical fatigue and excitement must be avoided, for these\nengender jangled nerves, sleeplessness, and finally inability to isolate\nthe mind from the orbit of our own concerns to the sphere of others The processes that occur in crystal-gazing are thought transference\nand telepathy A communication of ideas is set up between the\nprophet and client, and the mirror-like surface of the crystal is the\nmedium by means of which innate thoughts are reflected As far as possible, the clairvoyant submerges his own personality in\nthat of the inquirer, putting himself in his or her place The best\nmeans of creating these links is to place an article constantly worn by\nthe inquirer to the head Profound silence brings about the sense of\natmosphere and aura usual to the latter, and by these means, and an\nintent gazing into the crystal, visions originate The crystal is supposed to be the magic bridge which spans the\nchasm fixed between itself and the spiritual world In the iron it\ncontains are situated the collective and culminating forces",
    "In the iron it\ncontains are situated the collective and culminating forces Mists of white, green, blue, and violet tints are symbols of good\nfortune and happiness; black, yellow, and red are warnings of disaster When the mists disperse and gradually ascend to the surface, the\nclairvoyant may reply to any question in the affirmative; mists that\ndescend to the bottom are signs of negation Images that develop to the left of the clairvoyant are real; those on\nthe right are purely symbolical It will be seen from the above that in order to apply oneself to the\nachievement of reading the secret depths of mind, character, talent,\nand circumstances, it is necessary to possess the power of separating\noneself from material surroundings and allowing the spirit to\ndominate the body This can only be executed by the process of hypnotizing oneself Clairvoyance is based on certain forms of this semi-somnolent state,\nfor, just as in hypnotism, the mind reigns supreme over matter and\nbecomes isolated by means of an object, so, in clairvoyance, a waking\ntrance is brought about by fixed gazing into the crystal However, there are other methods of inducing this state, more or\nless difficult of manipulation, until constant practice and experience\nhave made them a habit For the reason, formerly mentioned, that long gazing at a bright\nsurface is injurious to eyesight, many clairvoyants prefer to create\nvisions without the use of a crystal Words repeated over and over again have a mysterious power of\n\n\nisolating the sixth sense from the rest For example, the word AUM is extraordinarily symbolical It stands\nfor three\ninfluences—\n\n\nA = the objective U = the subjective M = the Eternal These are the three kingdoms in the heart of man The objective, being the natural surroundings of objects and events\nwhich we all can feel and see The subjective, being the realm of influences the degree of which is\nfelt according to the perception and training of our spiritual forces;\ntoo often vague and illusive, because most of us ignore its existence The Eternal World, being that state to which the subjective world, in\nits highest state of development, leads This word repeated, slowly\nand steadily at first, and then at great speed, has a marvelous power\nto create as it were a vacuum between the spirit and body of the\nprophet His mind dwells on its meaning; the vibration of the different letters\nacts on his mind, and he is carried by gentle stages to the very seat of\nhis spiritual being It is when he attains this full development that he is granted large,\nclear, and deep perceptions of his client’s character, and is able to\nreveal facts concerning him which in his normal state would be\nabsolutely impossible The sensation experienced is that of being plunged into space in\nwhich the senses of sight, hearing, and touch are transmuted to the\nbrain and spirit The student will doubtless be discouraged at first at his inability to\nproduce this state, but he should remember that hard work and\nperseverance are the attributes which all must give to be perfect in\nany learning, art, or science One destined to become a great mathematician stumbles in\nchildhood with despair over the first addition sum, and the most\ndistinguished musician has to do battle with the rudiments of music Thus it is in clairvoyance Seemingly insuperable difficulties\nsurround the novice who has never learnt to recognize the value and\npower of the sixth sense Patience, a tranquil, determined mind, and\nnot a little courage, are necessary in this branch of science Time and\ngrowth work wonders in the persistent mind, and it will be seen that\nthe obstacles gradually move aside, the curtain is lifted, and the\nstrenuous seeker reaches that mature vision which he has formerly\nimagined dimly, if at all It is a good plan for the novice to ponder on his own name, and,\nshut away from all distractions, repeat it again and again to himself He will gradually feel a sense of deepest mystery surrounding him, for\nin that name is concentrated the riddle of existence The blending of\nspiritual and material kingdoms lies behind it, and the material slips\nrapidly into obscurity The Eternal Question\nThe eternal question based on introspection faces him “What am I Whither am I going What is the meaning of this thoughtful brain,\nthis palpitating heart, these stirring pulses through which the\nmysteries of the soul flash in a thousand directions ”\nThese and many other questions will move into being until the\neternal atmosphere of spirituality is reached, and the wings of the soul\nbecome unfurled and increase in strength and power to lift him to the\nrealms of his desire Only when the heart is pure and worthy will the vision be granted\n—the dross of bitterness, envy, hatred, and malice, which generally\nhide the precious jewel from the light, and render scintillating\nbrilliance impossible, all discarded Every one knows how difficult it is to control the mind, and keep it\nfrom mean and uncharitable thoughts It is more rebellious even than\nthe body, and influences it for good or evil Temptations small and great are created and emerge from the mind No one thieves with his fingers until the thought of theft is born His\nmental faculties plan the ways and means and cunningly devise\nprotections against the punishment in which the act when culminated\nresults, unless artful deceptions render discovery impossible No\ntreason or wrong-doing was ever committed before the deed was\nhatched in the brain The mental sphere may be a hotbed of falsehoods and treachery, or\nit may be a world of purest truth and virtue Therefore, before all else, the clairvoyant must learn to discipline\nand constrain his thoughts, and this is extremely difficult, and seems\nat first almost impossible; yet, if the lamp is to burn brightly, it must\nbe kept clean, and daily fed with all thoughts that are benevolent,\ngentle, and good A humble demeanor, a longing for purity and singleness of purpose\n\n\nare needed to bring about these noble qualities, and here it is that\nproper treatment of the body is invaluable Simple diet, early rising, daily exercise, constant isolation, and\ncultivation of good habits create the orbit for the higher faculties These are the elementary rudiments of clairvoyance, and, unless they\nare mastered, the clairvoyant, no matter how diligent and persevering\nhe may be in his studies and labor, is doomed to failure A quiet state of mind helps in all the storms and stress of life It is a\nharbor of quiet blue waters, in which the seafaring vessel may shelter\nbeneath peaceful starlit skies, securing power and refreshment and\nshafts of clearest light by which other human ships may be led\ntowards his haven CHAPTER LIII\nTABLE-TURNING\nFun for an Impromptu Party\nThere is something sufficiently fascinating about table-turning to\nfix the attention and interest of guests gathered for an evening’s\nrecreation, and as it needs no previous arranging, it is an excellent\ndevice at an impromptu party The table must be round, light, and of wood As many of the\ncompany as can be squeezed in its circle may take part, but the\nexcitement will be shared by the onlookers Each places both hands\nlightly on the surface with the thumbs touching, and the little finger\njoined to that of his neighbor It is important that there should be no\nbreak in the chain of hands, as this prevents the flow of the electric\ncurrent, which is alone responsible for the vibration and movement of\nthe table The time of waiting for its first motion must be spent in silence, and\nmay last from five to twenty minutes Any “wag” who takes it into his\nhead to jerk the table with his knees, or push it with his hands during\nthis period, should at once be called upon to forfeit his place Those experienced in table-turning know perfectly well how\ndifferent the movement caused by such a proceeding is from the real\ntilt the table gives when moved by the electric current, and will soon\ndiscover the impostor, for no trick can bring about the same curious\nvibration The table should be treated with the greatest respect, otherwise its\n“spirit” becomes taciturn and silent, and, even after the tilting\nbackwards and forwards has gone on for some time, it has been\nknown to retire at the slightest sign of levity and incredulity Not until\nthe manipulators are assured of its movement should any question be\nasked, and, before this is done, they must agree upon some plan by\nwhich they may comprehend the answers given Two taps or bows may stand for “Yes,” one for “No,” or vice versa;\nbut, when once decided upon, should remain fixed The question must not be asked until the preliminary vibrations\nhave ceased; then one of the party—the medium, so-called because he\n\n\nor she possesses more magnetic power than the rest, addresses the\nspirit, and those anxious to hear anything affecting themselves must\nuse him or her as mouthpiece The table is questioned in some such\nway as\nthis:—\nMedium—“Are you going to be kind to us to-night, O Spirit Please\nanswer two taps for ‘Yes,’ and one for ‘No ’”\nAt this polite request the spirit doubtless replies in the affirmative",
    "’”\nAt this polite request the spirit doubtless replies in the affirmative When ages and dates are required, the medium counts the number of\ntaps, and gleans the result when the taps cease Names are discovered by carefully going through the alphabet Each\ntap stands for a letter, and, when the table pauses, the initial and\nother letters of the name are provided, until the whole is spelt out Thus, supposing the medium inquires the name of his left-hand\nneighbor, which it may be presumed is Alice, the spirit, having\napparently heard the question, gives one decided jerk, and then is\nperfectly motionless The medium says “A—next letter, please ” The\ntable obediently bobs twelve times; that is, until L is reached The\nmedium continues, “Next letter, please,” and the table obligingly bobs\nnine times “I,” says the medium—“next letter, please ” Three bobs\ngive C Five bobs give E The table is then motionless, and another\nquestion may be asked Queries should never be clamored at once by the impatient guests,\nnor should one monopolize the spirit’s attention with his own affairs A good plan to follow is for each in turn to supply the medium with\nan inquiry The initials, Christian or surname, of the man or maid one\nis destined to marry may be revealed by the spirit Initial letters are\nbetter, because when there are many eager to know their fate, the full\nnames take too long Sometimes it will be noticed that the spirit gives very decided\nanswers, jerking to one side so abruptly that the players are obliged to\npush back their chairs and have some difficulty in keeping their hands\non its surface At other times it seems undecided, and if the question\nis an unwelcome one, the spirit will race through the alphabet again\nand again at a great speed and without a moment’s pause When this\nis the case, another question should be asked The Presence of an “Unbeliever”\n\n\nShould the spirit refuse to communicate at the end of twenty\nminutes, the manipulators may be sure that an “unbeliever” is in their\nmidst, or that the whole assembly has too small magnetic power When this happens, other persons should try their skill As mediums are not uncommon, there will probably be one among\nthem, and a brief waiting at the table will prove that this is the case A good experiment to spare further waste of time is for the circle of\nattendants to decrease until only sufficient are left to maintain the\nchain In this way the medium is discovered A good medium creates\nmovement in five minutes or less, and, with a tiny tea-table, it has\noften been shown that, when once set in full motion, all may\nwithdraw except the medium under whose magnetic touch the table\nwill continue to gyrate for several minutes The spirit has many characteristics, and sometimes tires of the part\nexpected of it, and, yielding to a frivolous mood, will dance or jump\nall over the floor, sometimes carrying its ministers out of the room to\nthe passage At others it remains true to the rôle of dignified sage,\nphilosopher, and seer; but its moods are complicated, and these\ndepend a great deal upon the amount of concentration and will that\ndominate it Constant peals of laughter provoke it to giddiness or abrupt, curt\n“answers,” while not infrequently, after several hours in which\ninquiries have been constantly fired at it, it shows a most discourteous\ninclination to remain stolidly non-committal and motionless Then the\nmedium with gentle coaxings may restore its good temper and\npatience, but only for a short period Perhaps the real reason for this reserve is to be found in the players\nthemselves, whose magnetic power becomes exhausted, and fails to\nact as spontaneously as during the early hours of the evening At any\nrate, when the medium asks courteously, “Are you very weary, O\nSpirit ” the table will frequently reply with two most emphatic bobs Another means of discovering a medium and an “unbeliever” (the\nlatter term does not imply a cynic, but simply an individual with an\ninsufficient supply of magnetism) is to ask the spirit to spell out the\nname of the person it loves best In nine cases out of ten, it will spell\nout the name of the medium, and it will be found that it is as quick to\nreveal the person it hates, viz , the “unbeliever”—no matter if he is far\nremoved from its vicinity CHAPTER LIV\nPALMISTRY\nSecrets of the Past, Present, and Future\nAt social functions, such as garden and evening parties, fairs, &c ,\nthere are few people whose notice and attentions are so solicited as\nthe palmist’s He speedily finds himself the central figure of a knot of\npeople of both sexes, all eager to thrust their hands under his\ndiscerning eye, and compare their own estimation of their character—\nwhich, alas is often subject to a severe shock—with that revealed by\nthe sage’s comparison of lines, mounts, and stars engraved upon the\npalm The true palmist is no flatterer, nor is he over-hasty in judgment Fig 1 —Names of the “mounts” and their signs Most hands index as many contradictions and complexities of\ndisposition as the human face, and the experienced reader of these\nhieroglyphics finds that, to secure a just diagnosis of the subject’s\ncharacter, comparison of the many signs and minute calculations are\nnecessary The art of addition, subtraction, and multiplication is the\nfundamental principle of his profession Shape, quality, proportion, and texture are of paramount\nimportance, and these should be examined before the lines are\nstudied The size of the fingers, and the manner in which they are set\non the hand, furnish the key to the character of the hand examined Each finger has its name and sign, and each has its distinguishing\ncharacteristics For just as every leaf and petal possesses some minute\ndifference that distinguishes it from its neighbor, so no hands in the\nworld are exactly alike in form and structure The name given to the first finger is Jupiter; to the second, Saturn;\nto the third, Apollo; to the fourth, Mercury; and to the thumb, Pollux Fig 1 shows some signs with their respective names The natural bend of the fingers is important, and the palmist should\nbe quick to notice its natural attitude before examining the interior of\nthe hand Some fingers are distinguished by their independent, prominent\n\n\nposition over the rest When the tips are inclined to curl to the palm, a\nplodding, determined nature is indicated, one that does not easily\nrelinquish a set aim or purpose because of obstacles A wide space between Jupiter and Saturn shows unconventionality,\nand originality of thought and outlook When the Jupiter finger is upright and straight, and of normal\nlength, a just, candid nature is revealed Should its position be in\nadvance of the other fingers, the love of dominion Falling slightly\nbehind: dependency on others, a shirking of taking the initiative and\nresponsibilities Short: ingratitude, no enthusiasm Pointed: tact,\ncomprehension, and sympathy (Fig 2 ) Square: integrity, unkindly\nfrank in expressing opinions The generous and broad phalanges of Saturn show gravity, depth of\ncharacter, and sense of proportion A short Saturn: imprudence,\ninclination to act on impulse, somewhat foolhardy Spatulate: energy Square: cool, clear-headed, thought before action, absence of hasty\njudgments (Fig 3 )\nFig 2 —The Jupiter pointed finger Fig 3 —The Saturn square finger Fig 4 —The Apollo spatulate finger Apollo: well-developed, artistic tendencies Forward: painting,\ndrawing, or sculpture Pointed: the artistic ability is greater than the\npractical Spatulate: a sense of the beautiful in form and color,\ndramatic powers (Fig 4 )\nMercury, set lower than the other fingers, reveals the fact that many\nadverse circumstances have been battled with Pointed: tact,\ndiscrimination, intuition Square: love of scientific pursuits, good\nreasoning powers",
    "Square: love of scientific pursuits, good\nreasoning powers Beneath each finger rest their respective mounts There are two\nmounts of Mars—that immediately at the base of the Jupiter mount,\nand that situated beneath Mercury mount The mount of Luna is\ndirectly opposite to that of Venus, which is found where the thumb\n\n\njoins the wrist (Fig 5 )\nIn many hands it will be observed that the position of the mounts\nvaries Jupiter may swell over the boundary line, and squeeze Saturn\ninto close proximity with Apollo, which, in its turn, may take the\nplace allotted to Mercury These signs are important Jupiter’s approach to Saturn shows timidity and self-consciousness Saturn’s approach to Apollo shows that the creation of art and\nliterature is tinged with melancholy Apollo’s approach to Mercury shows humanity, charity, and a\npeaceable disposition Mercury’s approach to Mars: self-reliance and resource in danger Mars’ approach to Mercury: originality, defiance, and ability to hold\none’s own against opposition Luna inclining towards the wrist: reveries, some frivolity and love\nof pleasure Fig 5 —Showing the position of the various mounts A glance will reveal which bumps are most developed in the hand,\nand these, taken together, are valuable keys to character Jupiter and Mercury are worldly, versatile traits Jupiter and Apollo are honest, noble traits Jupiter and Venus are somewhat selfish, vain traits Saturn and Mercury are signs that, unless among gay companions,\nthe individual has no power of resource These mounts are generally prominent in the hands of those who\ndepend entirely upon others for their amusement, and have developed\nno powers by which to create a world of their own They are shallow,\ndiscontented persons as a rule, unable to concentrate their minds on\nbooks or music Saturn and Mars: a thrifty temperament, verging on the avaricious Saturn and Luna: hypersensitiveness, distrust of self A nature which\nis distressed, and rendered almost morbid by the sadder side of life,\nart, and literature Apollo and Luna: extreme imaginative force Apollo and Mars: in a creative hand show an inclination to depict\nthe strong things of life, a certain amount of realism in portrayals A\n\n\nlove of danger and adventure Mercury and Mars: a superabundant amount of fun and good spirits Mercury and Venus: a gay, somewhat heartless, temperament Mercury and Luna make a humorist Venus and Apollo: a charitable, generous individual The Phalanges\nEach finger has three divisions, known as the phalanges, and these\nare supposed to represent three worlds The first, which includes the nail, stands for the spiritual The second stands for the intellectual The third stands for the material Correct comparison of these phalanges provides the orbit of\nthoughts and ambitions in which the mind of the individual revolves,\nand when one of these predominates in length over the others, that\nquality for which it stands is the principal quality possessed, although\na further study of the hand may contradict these attributes, or render\nthem more excessive For this reason the student is warned not to form his judgment by\none indication only He can arrive at no reliable solution to the riddle\nof character until he has studied every portion of the hand and linked\ntogether the various peculiarities it expresses The thumb is, as it were, the figurehead of the hand There is more\ncharacter to be discerned in its form, habitual attitude, phalanges, and\nthe space between it and the first finger, than in any other signs\nconveyed by the physical formation of the rest The first phalange\nindexes strength or weakness of will power, constancy or fickleness,\naffection or coldness of disposition The second phalange shows by\nwhat degree of reason the will is guided Should it be much thinner\ntowards the base than at the apex, a certain degree of narrow-minded,\none-sided views is indicated The third phalange represents emotions The two angles stand for\nmusic, and are strongly marked upon the thumb of the musician and\ncomposer The first indicates time, the second harmony When the length of the third phalange preponderates over the first\nand second, a passionate character, uncurbed by the power of will,\ndiscipline of reason, and self-control is shown In a well-balanced, warm-hearted nature, these phalanges are in\nproportion Extreme length in the first phalange shows a tyrannical\nand dogmatic will, which will surely prove a stumbling-block through\nlife, unless the thumb of the right hand modifies this natural\nobstinacy The palmist should beware of, as it were, labeling the hand He\ncannot be too cautious in reaching an ultimate conclusion The hand\npossesses a range of complexities Strength and weakness are mingled Great talents may be mitigated by signs of almost equal inefficiency Therefore all the links of circumstances and character depicted should\nbe consolidated into a chain before the exponent ventures to voice his\nconvictions The left hand indicates natural tendencies; the right shows how far\nthe good and bad propensities of the individual have been developed It is possible that the former may represent an intellectual type which\nthe latter does not verify For instance, a clear and unbroken head line\nin the left hand may be marred and broken in the right, thus showing\nthat ability in this direction has been neglected; or it may be that an\ninefficient head line in the left palm continues clear and deep on the\nright; and the conclusion arrived at is, of course, that, by dogged will\nand perseverance, inherent incompetency has gradually been\nremedied Upon the palm six important lines are inscribed, as shown in\nFig 6:—\nThe life line, which forms a semicircle at the base of the thumb The head line, which traverses the palm, and forms an angle with\nthe life line The heart line, which runs above and parallel with the head line The fate line, which runs horizontally from Mount Saturn to the\nwrist The Apollo or fortune line, which runs parallel with the fate line from\nMount Apollo to Mount Luna The line of health, which forms an angle with the base of the life\nline, and reaches almost to Mount Mercury The ring of Saturn, reaching from Mount Apollo to Mount Jupiter The line of intuition, curving from Mount Mercury to Mount Luna Upon the depth, direction, and length of these lines the vitality,\nhealth, affections, future, finances, general tendencies of disposition\nand circumstances of the subject may be arrived at A - A The Line of Life E - E The Line of Fortune B - B The Head Line F - F The Line of Health C - C The Heart Line G - G The Ring of Saturn D - D The Line of Fate H - H The Line of Intuition I Bracelets Fig 6 —The principal lines of the palm The manifestation of stars and islands, dots, grilles, and chains are\nindications of misfortune, obstacles, ill-health, and domestic\nunhappiness Triangles, squares, clear-cut crosses, when not formed\non or by the lines of the hands, and circles on the mounts, are\nfortunate Signs—and Wonders The age of the subject is arrived at in the following manner Divide\nthe fate line, call the point of division 30 The age of 10 is slightly\nabove the base of Luna From 10 to 50 the line should be partitioned\ninto equal parts; after that, however, the distances lessen The life line may also be used to calculate age, but here the method\nof calculation is reversed, for childhood is above the thumb, and old\nage is indicated by the length of the curve to the wrist Doubtless the most interesting marks to be found among the minor\nlines of the hand, such as indicate voyages, change of environment,\ntalents and ambitions, are those which concern the attachments, love\naffairs, and future marriage of the subject These are the influence lines, which may be discerned running from\nMount Luna to the line of Fate, from Mount Venus to the line of Life,\nand on the Mount of Mercury Their depth, length, and clearness\ndepend upon the enduring nature of the sentiment involved When\ncrossed, barred, or cut, they demonstrate the fact that difficulties and\nopposition from parents, friends, or relatives are to be encountered, or\nit may be that the influence was merely a fleeting infatuation, what is\ncommonly known as “calf-love,” which time and deeper development\nof the character have annihilated These signs should be compared with the age calculated upon the\n\n\nfate line—it will then be discovered whether the influence lines are of\nthe past, present, or future; only constant practice and experience can\naid the exponent to a correct estimate of the period of these\nhappenings It may happen that the hand of a man or woman under thirty years\nof age shows no indication of any of these influences, but this does\nnot mean that love and matrimony will never happen to them, for\nthese lines are sometimes late in appearance and may be found years\nafter An island situated on an influence line is extremely unfortunate, for\nit means either that marriage will be rendered impossible by the ill-\nhealth of the subject, or that the man to whom she is engaged is fickle\nor worthless in character Likewise, it is unfortunate for Mercury’s\ninfluence lines to terminate on the heart line, for this foretells\nbereavement and widowhood Should it cross the heart line and run\ntowards Venus, a separation is almost certain to culminate the\nalliance Nearly all the lines traversing Mount Luna are attachments or\ninfluences connected with the opposite sex When they rise from the\nlife line, they may stand for close friends or relatives of the same sex Another important group of lines may be discerned at the base of\nthe palm The subject should rest the elbow on the table, with the\nhand bent over the wrist, which is marked with “rascettes” or\nbracelets When these lines curve up towards the palm, they signify\nthat the ideals, thoughts, and impulses governing the character are\nnoble and uplifting; when they droop to the wrist, mercenary\nambitions and self-interest are dominant When the rascettes are\ncreased by other lines, a life of strenuous work is shown When deep,\nsmooth, and continuous—health, wealth, and happiness In drawing-room palmistry, the palmist is often embarrassed and\nkept from concentration of thought by the buzzing chatter and\nlaughter of friends and acquaintances, all of whom are eager to have\ntheir hands read, and the majority of whom expect that a lightning\nglance is sufficient to reveal every detail of their character and future Palms are thrust under his notice by smiling, optimistic young\npeople, each of whom believes implicitly that for her or him the\nfuture is a land of honey and roses—a straight sunny path, wherein\nthere are no piercing thorns and sole-bruising flints Guileless and Good\nWe all hold ourselves very dear; flaws in our natures, however\nserious and detrimental to character, seem trifles light as air We\nappear to ourselves—especially when we are young—to be very good\nand guileless We are assured that all follies will be conquered,\nrepented of, left far behind us in the land of oblivion, long before old\nage catches us in the hip and thigh And the palmist will often find\nthat those who clamor most loudly for frank and impartial revelations\nare just those who are wounded by a single word that jars their self-\nesteem or questions the high price set upon their individual qualities For this reason he must go gently, speaking without flattery or\nundue censure, and upon such occasions he would do well to keep his\nmind from diving beneath the surface of the trivial pleasant\nprophecies expected of him He should never wound the\nsusceptibilities of some nervous, high-strung soul by prophesying ill-\nhealth, bereavement, or death The more serious side of the science can be dealt with only when\nthe exponent and subject are secure from prying eyes and listening\nears, and even then the palmist should be the very embodiment of\ntact, sympathy, and discretion Should the subject really desire the probings of some past secret\nmisfortune, the palmist may voice his interpretation of the history\nwritten in his hand, but, in a manner of humane and tender kindness,\nmaking much of the lighter side, and endeavoring to encourage and\nhelp by faith in a happier future To blurt out some past tragedy or foretell one before others is a\nwanton cruelty of which the palmist should never be guilty He should\nalways endeavor to put himself in the place of the subject, and even\nwhen the latter is, as often happens to be the case, incredulous of his\npowers and eager to show his ignorance, the palmist should not allow\nhimself to be stung to retort by revealing a jealously-guarded secret The physician, the clergyman, the lawyer are the recipients of\npathetic and strange confidences; the palmist will also discover many,\nand must ever hold them as inviolably He must be a gentleman in the highest sense of the word—\nhonorable, chivalrous, humane; and, whenever the opportunity\noccurs, strong to encourage the weak and console and comfort the\nmen and women, both young and old, whose hands reveal their heart-\n\n\nbreak, weariness, and sense of failure CHAPTER LV\nPHRENOLOGY\nThe Estate “Under the Hat”\nPhrenology is that science which may be said to provide a chart\nor map for the discovery of the treasures existing in the “estate under\nthe hat ” It is of Greek origin (phren, the mind; and logos, science), and\nis closely allied to craniology (Gr : kranion-logos, skull-science) The difference between these terms is as follows:—Craniology is a\nmere acquaintance with the skull Phrenology is a full and detailed\nknowledge of its contents This study is not founded on superstition, and the phrenologist is\nneither charlatan nor magician, for, just as a man’s mind may be\nrevealed by the contour of his features, the twitching or tightening of\nhis lips, a frowning or smoothing of the brows, so the physical\nformation of his skull reveals the propensities, talents, virtues, and\nweaknesses peculiar to his nature The thin leather of a bulging purse\nindicates an amount of coin; a closer observation demonstrates of\nwhat this coin is composed—cents, dimes, or dollars—and in the same\nway the skin of the skull bulges, and close study and knowledge of the\nlocality of its developments show the various qualities endowed The student must possess a chart (Fig 1), and memorize it before he\nessays to indicate character by means of phrenology, for its kingdoms\nare as well defined as the counties on a map Fig 1",
    "1 —Phrenology chart There are forty-two faculties or organs in all—some more\nprominent than others, according to the disposition, temperament,\neducation, profession, and personal inclination of the individual 1 Amativeness\n15 Self-esteem\n29 Size\n2 Conjugal love\n16 Firmness\n30 Weight\n\n\n3 Parental love\n17 Conscientiousness\n31 Color\n4 Friendship\n18 Hope\n32 Order\n5 Order\n5 Inhabitiveness\n19 Spirituality\n33 Calculation\n6 Continuity\n20 Veneration\n34 Locality\n7 Vitativeness\n21 Benevolence\n35 Eventuality\n8 Combativeness\n22 Constructiveness\n36 Time\n9 Destructiveness\n23 Ideality\n37 Tune\n10 Alimentiveness\n24 Sublimity\n38 Language\n11 Acquisitiveness\n25 Imitation\n39 Causality\n12 Secretiveness\n26 Mirth\n40 Comparison\n13 Cautiousness\n27 Individuality\n41 Human nature\n14 Approbativeness\n28 Form\n42 Suavity\nThese may be divided into six important\nclasses:—\n1 The social region, which\nincludes—\nA Amativeness —Normal—interest in and love for the opposite sex Too prominent—material Too small—coldness and\nindifference B Conjugal affection —Normal—constant and faithful love Too\nprominent—jealous and selfish Too small—fickle and\ninconstant fancy C Parental love —Normal—self-abnegating love for children Too\nprominent—indiscreet monopolizing Too\nprominent—indiscreet monopolizing Too small—absence of\ntenderness D Friendship —Normal—sociability, warm attachments Too\nprominent—too exacting, infatuations Too small—inability\nto make friends E Inhabitiveness —Normal—love of home and native land Too\nprominent—intense dislike to travel Too small—a desire for\nconstant change of scenery F Continuity —Normal—the power of concentration Too prominent—\nthe prevalence of one idea, self-centered Too small—lack of\nconcentration 2 The selfish\npropensities—\nA Vitativeness —Normal—vitality, joy of living Too prominent—\nextreme dread of illness and death Too small—callous of\ncalamity B Combativeness —Normal—courageous, antagonistic instincts Too\nprominent—quarrelsome Too small—want of mettle,\ncowardly C Destructiveness —Normal—hardness and durability Too prominent\n—vindictive Too small—lack of interest, inability to endure\npain or misfortune D Alimentiveness —Normal—good and healthy appetite Too\nprominent—gluttony, fastidiousness Too small—want of\nappetite E Acquisitiveness —Normal—thrift and economy Too prominent—\navarice Too small—extravagant, a spendthrift F Secretiveness —Normal—reserve, tact, discretion Too prominent—\ndeceit, intrigue, falsehood Too small—indiscreet revelations,\nthoughtlessness G Cautiousness —Normal—apprehension, prudent care Too\nprominent—timid, over-anxious Too small—reckless,\nfoolhardy 3 Self-controlling\nfaculties—\nA Approbativeness —Normal—appreciation of public opinion,\ncourtesy, manners, good breeding Too prominent—\nostentatious, “playing to the gallery,” undue love of\nadulation Too small—ignoring of general opinions,\nunconventional B Self-esteem —Normal—individuality, personality, a proper sense of\npersonal importance and ability Too prominent—conceit,\negoism, tyranny Too small—sense of inability and\nincompetency C Firmness —Normal—will-power, assertion of self, determination,\nfortitude Too prominent—overbearing, perverse, illogical Too small—inability to concentrate or overcome 4 Moral\nsentiments—\nA Conscientiousness —Normal—high regard for honor and duty Too\nprominent—morbid hypersensitiveness Too small—want of\nprinciple B Hope —Normal—optimistic trust and buoyancy Too prominent—\nfoolish disregard of experience Too small—an inclination to\ndespair, sad and melancholy C Spirituality —Normal—trust, faith, religious, devout, reverential Too prominent—fanaticism Too small—cynicism D Veneration —Normal—chivalry towards the old, admiration for the\ngreat, modest, quiet demeanor Too prominent—obsession Too small—disrespectful, irreverent E Benevolence —Normal—philanthropic inclinations, humane,\ncharitable, generous Too prominent—imprudent giving,\nwaste of sympathy Too small—selfish blindness and\nindifference 5 Intellectual\nfaculties—\nA Individuality —Normal—a desire for knowledge, respect and regard\nfor the feelings of others Too prominent—over-curious,\nspying Too small—lack of humor B Form —Normal—ability to remember faces, shapes, and general\nappearance of buildings, &c Too prominent—sensitiveness to\nwant of beauty and contour Too small—inability to observe\nshapes carefully C Size —Normal—the power of judging proportions at a glance Too\nprominent—too much sense of comparison Too small—\nincapable of judging length and breadth D Weight —Normal—mechanical and mathematical inclinations Too\nprominent—great regard for the laws of balance and gravity Too small—awkward movements, want of harmony E Color —Normal—the art of blending colors, delight in nature Too\nprominent—hypersensitive of uncongenial environment;

    "It is essential for him to possess and\ncultivate a buoyant disposition, which will tend to help and encourage\nhim, and not to condemn a subject for the weaknesses of character he\ndiscovers Few ills have no cure This is as true of mental inefficiency as of\nphysical ailments, and the prophecies of the humane phrenologist are\nset in the major and not the minor key Every individual, however\nseemingly worthless or uninteresting, possesses some divine gift,\nwhich perhaps lies dormant and neglected through his ignorance of its\nexistence Here it is that the phrenologist is able to let a chink of light\npenetrate the darkness, and a few kind, judicious words will do much\nto bring back the latent self-respect to him who has despaired of being\nreleased from the fetters of evil habits, intemperance, sloth, or\nindifference to the liberty of wholesome well-being The motto of the student should be never to condemn When he has\nonce reached the secret of identity, he should set himself to appeal\nand rouse the dying spirit of manhood to a new resurrection of power\nand achievement, for probably adverse and bitter circumstances,\nheredity, and poverty have done much to batter down the higher\nnature and develop the baser qualities of the man whose faculties he\nexamines; and he can only dimly imagine, but never fathom, the\n\n\nstrength of the temptations that warp the various molds in which the\nhuman mind is set The Humorous Side of Phrenology\nIn drawing-room exhibitions, only the lighter side of phrenology\nshould be dealt with A fund of humor and wit can be demonstrated\nhere, so that instruction is blended with amusement, and it is not\nunfitting to use animals as illustrations of different qualities For\ninstance, the refrain in the once-popular lyric, “But the cat came\nback,” clearly testifies that this animal possessed the nodosity of\ninhabitiveness to a marked degree Not so the man of music-hall fame\nwhose pathetic pleading, “Please don’t take me home,” stirs our\nheartstrings most potently, or “Bill Bailey,” the wanderer The small\ndog that ogles a larger comrade engaged with a bone, but who fears\nhis mightier powers too greatly to venture open attack, possesses\n“cupboard” affection rather than amativeness The blinkered horse, were it granted speech, would doubtless\ndemonstrate the fact that it has cultivated the faculty of spirituality in\nno small degree, for its sense of the unseen is remarkable The bull has only to kick up his heels and lower his horns at a red\nparasol to vindicate his apt discernment of color The manner in\nwhich the watch-dog registers the shape of his enemy’s calves in his\nmemory is a truly astonishing sign of his sense of form and locality The serpent’s feline smile at the bird is eloquent of its sociability and\nexpectation; its glistening coils are the personification of blandness\nand invitation to embrace Stay-at-home oysters are famous for\ndomesticity The fish swallowing the hooked worm illustrates a\nbeautiful trust and faith in the providential plans man culminates for\nhis welfare In the hobbled ass, wandering over and over his patch of\ngrass, economy, adhesiveness, and a very praiseworthy amount of\napplication are shown It might be well for the ambitious phrenologist to study the skulls of\nthese and other animals, birds, and fishes, for in these the\nunadulterated essences of virtues and vices and instinctive\npropensities are discovered The human head may be likened to a very\nrich pudding composed of very different ingredients, flavorings, and\nstrata of coloring, and sugared with conventionalities and hypocrisies The animal, on the contrary, exhibits its true qualities as frankly as a\n\n\nsirloin of raw beef suspended in a butcher’s window CHAPTER LVI\nTELLING FORTUNES BY CARDS, DICE, DOMINOES, ETC What the Future has in Store\nThere is no more amusing diversion for a frivolous half-hour’s\nentertainment than that of fortune-telling by cards Young or old\nenjoy it, and with a ready tongue the combinations presented may be\nso varied that quite surprisingly good predictions can be made Surround the whole business with as much mystery as possible Insist that all shuffling be done by the subject himself, and that\ncutting is always carried out with the left hand Learn the meanings of the cards by heart This is not difficult, and\nby doing so one is enabled to tell a fortune quickly: always a more\nimpressive proceeding than telling it card by card These are the generally accepted meanings of the\ncards:—\nClubs\nAce of Clubs, wealth and prosperity King of Clubs, upright,\naffectionate Queen of Clubs, deeply in love Knave of Clubs, generous\nand sincere Ten of Clubs, a fortune from an unexpected quarter Nine of\nClubs, obstinacy; disputes with friends Eight of Clubs, a love of money Seven of Clubs, fortune and great happiness Six of Clubs, a lucrative\npartnership Five of Clubs, marriage with a wealthy person Four of\nClubs, inconstancy Three of Clubs, a second or third marriage Two of\nClubs, opposition Spades\nAce of Spades, a love affair; if reversed, a death King of Spades, an\nambitious person Queen of Spades, a treacherous friend Knave of\nSpades, indolent, but well-meaning Ten of Spades, an unlucky card Nine of Spades, the worst card in the pack; sickness, or loss of fortune Eight of Spades, opposition from friends Seven of Spades, sorrow Six of\n\n\nSpades, great fortune Five of Spades, success; a happy marriage Four of\nSpades, illness; small loss of money Three of Spades, an unfortunate\nmarriage Two of Spades, a death Hearts\nAce of Hearts, pleasure; if with Spades, quarreling; if with Diamonds,\nnews of an absent friend; if with Clubs, merry-making King of Hearts,\nnice, but hasty and passionate Queen of Hearts, fair, affectionate Knave\nof Hearts, the subject’s dearest friend Ten of Hearts, the antidote of bad\ncards that lie near it, but confirming the good Nine of Hearts, wealth; this\nis also the wish card Eight of Hearts, feasting and merry-making Seven\nof Hearts, fickle Six of Hearts, generous, easily imposed upon Five of\nHearts, waverer, changeable Four of Hearts, marriage late in life Three\nof Hearts, imprudent; hot-headed action, which has disastrous\nconsequences Two of Hearts, extraordinary success and good fortune Diamonds\nAce of Diamonds, a letter; the card next to it will indicate its nature King of Diamonds, hot tempered Queen of Diamonds, a coquette Knave\nof Diamonds, a selfish person Ten of Diamonds, money Nine of\nDiamonds, a roving person Eight of Diamonds, marriage late in life Seven of Diamonds, a gambler Six of Diamonds, early marriage Five of\nDiamonds, friendship Four of Diamonds, unhappy marriage Three of\nDiamonds, quarrels, lawsuits, and disagreements Two of Diamonds, a\nserious love affair There are two effective ways of fortune-telling For the first, ask your subject to shuffle the cards very thoroughly\nand to wish all the time Then cut them into three piles with the left\nhand Should the wish card (the Nine of Hearts) be one of those cut, it\nis a lucky omen Notice two other cards and their possible bearing on the wish Now,\nafter lifting the cards and putting them together with the left hand,\nproceed to divide them into piles in this fashion The first pile is to yourself The second, to the house The third, to\nyour wish The fourth, what you do expect The fifth, what you don’t\n\n\nexpect The sixth, sure to come true The seventh foretells the\nhappenings of to-night Arrange these piles, as you deal out the cards one by one, in a\nsemicircle Then proceed to read them off by their meanings Another and rather more complicated method is to ask the person\nwhose fortune is being told which King he will be (if it is a woman,\none would naturally ask which Queen) After the wishing has been done as before, the fortune-teller lays\nout the cards in rows—seven in a row To read the fortune the teller must start from the King or Queen\nchosen, counting seven from him or her in every case The King or Queen of the same suit will always be the lover or\nsweetheart of the one whose fortune is being told, and the Knave\nbeing their thoughts, it is, of course, quite easy to discover their\nfeelings It is rather a good plan to write the meanings of the cards on an old\npack By using this a few times a rapid flow of ideas will much more\nreadily be induced It might be mentioned that a too strict adherence\nto rule is by no means either necessary or desirable in fortune-telling Tell what the combination of cards suggests to you—quite irrespective\nof the exact meaning of each—and you will be infinitely more\namusing and obtain much greater fame as a wizard Fig 1 —Cards dealt for fortune-telling: 1 to yourself; 2 to the house; 3 to\nyour wish; 4 what you do expect; 5 what you don’t expect; 6 sure to come\ntrue; 7 to-night A few predictions are shown by the accompanying diagrams Fig 1\ndepicts the manner of dealing out the cards in sets of seven, and in\nwhat respect each is to be read Fig 2 —Cards foretelling a wish about a love affair—leading to an early\nmarriage Fig 2 shows three cards which might conceivably come together in\nany one set They would be read as foretelling the following:—You\nwill get a wish (Nine of Hearts), which is about a love affair (Ace of\n\n\nSpades), and it will lead to an early marriage (Six of Diamonds) Fig 3 conveys the following:—You will get a letter (Ace of\nDiamonds) about money (Ten of Diamonds) Your good fortune,\nhowever, will not permit you to marry until late in life (Eight of\nDiamonds) The five cards representing Fig 4 tell that the subject’s\ndearest friend (Knave of Hearts) will make the acquaintance of a flirt\n(Queen of Diamonds), and will shortly after suffer illness or slight loss\nof money (Four of Spades), but afterwards he will fall in love with a\nfair affectionate woman (Queen of Hearts) and enjoy extraordinary\nsuccess (Two of Hearts) Fig 3",
    "3 —Foretelling the receipt of a letter about money, but the good fortune\nwill not permit the recipient to marry until late in life Fig 4 —Reveals that the subject’s dearest friend will make the acquaintance\nof a flirt, and will shortly suffer illness or slight loss of money, but\nafterwards will fall in love with a fair affectionate woman and enjoy\nextraordinary success A Throw of the Dice\nAlthough forecasting of the future from dice is one of the most\nancient methods of prediction, it is curiously enough almost unknown\nin modern days For this reason it is of special value to the home\nentertainer, and will prove infinitely simpler than the cards, the\nmeanings being easier to learn as well as fewer in number First chalk a magic circle on the table, then obtain a small cup or\nbox to shake the dice in Three dice only should be used The person whose future is at stake must shake and cast the dice in\nthe circle This, as in card fortune-telling, should be done with the left\nhand Three tells you of an approaching accident; four, a rise in your\nposition; five, that you will make the acquaintance of one who will be\na friend; six, predicts loss; seven, a scandal; eight, a reproach—that is\nnot undeserved; nine, a wedding; ten, a christening; eleven, trouble\nfor one you love; twelve, an important letter; thirteen, tears; fourteen,\n\n\nbeware of an enemy; fifteen, good luck and happiness; sixteen, a\njourney; seventeen, a water journey; three sixes, or eighteen points, is\na very good sign It means great profit in business, or something the\nperson wishes for very much Fortune-Telling by Dominoes\nA fairly unique accomplishment is to reveal the future by the aid of\ndominoes, and there is something sufficiently fascinating and\nmysterious about this mode of revelation to fill the uninitiated with\nawe at the powers of the exponent Each small oblong has its secret meaning by which some happening\nvital to the subject is illustrated It is a matter of little difficulty to\ncommit these to memory; and in this, as in other methods of\ndivination, the fundamental principle is that of comparison and\ncalculation The dominoes used range from double-six to double-blank, and by\nthese are symbolized the various vicissitudes of fate likely to befall\nmankind The exponent places his paraphernalia upon the table, and,\nhaving turned them with their black spots facing the surface, proceeds\nto shuffle them When this is done, the subject is requested to draw\nthree pieces, one at a time Between the choice of each the dominoes\nare shuffled The first supplies an impression; should it be drawn a second time,\nthe impression becomes a conviction The third, however, may lessen\nor wholly contradict its degree of importance, and this is where\ncalculation and comparison in blending the signs are essential to a\nsuccessful justification and interpretation of these symbols Double-six is an emblem of matrimonial happiness and financial\nprosperity Six-five is almost equally fortunate Perseverance and concentration\nare rewarded by ultimate success Six-four implies a comfortable income, and secures happiness in\nmarriage Six-three demonstrates that fate smiles upon the love and marriage\nof the subject Six-two —Prudence, hard work, and a certain amount of good luck,\nor exposure and shame for any wrong-doing Six-one promises two marriages to the young subject, the first of\n\n\nwhich will not be as happy as the second Should the subject be of\nmiddle age, this domino foretells the speedy arrival of good things\nand the fact that he or she will never be left lonely and uncared for Six-blank is, alas, a sign of great trouble—sickness, death, or heavy\nmoney losses Double-five presages that all achievements will be rewarded with a\nlarge amount of success, but inordinate wealth is not prophesied Five-four is almost as unfortunate a draw as six-blank",
    "Five-four is almost as unfortunate a draw as six-blank Should a\nyoung girl lift it, it means that her future husband will be poor and\nleave her a widow Further, he may be of extravagant disposition, in\nspite of his poverty Five-three indicates a tranquil and contented existence Sufficient\nmoney and matrimonial affection of moderate strength, the couple\nbeing incapable of passionate devotion Five-two conveys a warning that love and marriage are destined to\nan unhappy termination Five-one portends social popularity, but financial worries and losses Five-blank is supposed to demonstrate egotistical and avaricious\ncharacteristics, tendencies to swindling and intrigues, also a warning\nto remain unmarried Double-four Double-four —The man who earns his livelihood by manual labor\nmay regard this domino as a sign of future security and prosperity,\nbut to him whose profession needs mental achievement it is rather\ndisastrous Troubles and disappointments await him Four-three —Matrimony and moderate income Four-two proclaims an early marriage and moderate income Four-one —Wealth or many friends Four-blank —A sure warning that single life will be the best and\nhappiest It counsels that any secrets imparted to another will be\nindiscreetly revealed Double-three —Enormous riches Three-two \nforetells \nprosperity \nin \nmatrimony, \ntravels, \nand\nspeculations Three-one —Some danger and unhappiness The necessity for acting\nwith extreme caution in all matters Three-blank —Domestic \nunhappiness—such \nas \na \nquarrel \nor\nincompatibility of temperament of husband and wife The absence of\nharmony in the home Double-two promises average happiness and income Two-one —Two marriages, if the individual be a woman; financial\nfailures to a commercial man Two-blank —The intrigues of unscrupulous persons will meet with\ntemporary success It also denotes poverty, and an indolent husband The individual will return safely from all journeys undertaken Double-one —An existence free from money worries; peace and\nconstancy in love and marriage Double-blank seems to favor the deeds of unprincipled persons, and\nforetells want of integrity in lover and husband Figured Futurity\nThat a certain amount of character and future may be revealed by\nmeans of figures is a fact that may be tested for itself The results\nachieved by this method of divination are truly astonishing, and an\nample reward to the mathematician for his attempt to solve the riddle\nof human nature Certain groups of figures stand for different qualities Those given\nin the table which follows are only a small portion of the whole, but\nthey are sufficient for the beginner Each letter of the alphabet has its\naccompanying digit, and each digit has its abstract conditions,\nthus:—\nA 1 Passion, ambition, design B 2 Destruction, death C 3 Religion, destiny, the soul D 4 Solidity, sagacity, power E 5 The stars, happiness, graces, marriage\nF 6 Perfect labor G 7 Course of life, repose, liberty, success\nH 8 Justice, preservation I 9 Imperfection, grief, pain, expectation\nJ 600 Perfection K 10 Success, reason, future happiness L 20 Austerity, sadness M 30 Fame, a wedding N 40 Fêtes, a wedding O 50 Pardon, liberty P 60 Widowhood Q 70 Science, the graces R 80 A cure S 90 Blindness, error, affliction T 100 Divine favor U 200 Irresolution V 700 Strength W (double V ), 1400 Perfection of strength X 300 Safety, belief, philosophy Y 400",

    "Each taroc has its meaning, and\nfrom its relation to its fellows the manipulator is able to present a\nbrief sketch of character, inclination, and futurity Another simple method is to shuffle all the cards and request the\ninquirer to cut The manipulator then proceeds to draw the first\nseventeen tarocs, uncovering only the eighteenth and last card of the\npack These two cards create what degree of sympathy is shared\nbetween himself and his client, the keynote being given by the\n\n\nsymbolic meaning attached to the card The seventeen cards are now\nrevealed from left to right, their interpretation being given separately In order to reach a proper signification, they are then compared as\nfollows:—\n\n\nThe first with the seventeenth The second with the sixteenth The third with the fifteenth,\nand so on, each process increasing or taking from the first\nmanifestation CHAPTER LVII\nGRAPHOLOGY\nCharacter from Handwriting\nMore or less consciously, every one is a reader of handwriting If we\nhave not devoted thought and study to the subject, we merely gather\na vaguely favorable, or unfavorable, impression from the first letter\nwritten to us by a new acquaintance, and store it up with the other\nimpressions we have already gleaned from their personality When, however, time and thought are given to the fascinating cult\nof Graphology, it will be found to reward its students, by letting a\nthousand little sidelights on to character—and if the most “proper\nstudy of mankind is man,” then assuredly is Graphology a most\nhelpful adjunct to that end One must crawl before one can walk, and learn the alphabet before\none can master a language, therefore an impulsive learner must not\ngrow disgusted because his laborious reading of a handwriting is\ndisjointed, and may be obviously unlike the writer By the time he can\nread a character from a letter, without gathering a word of that letter’s\nsense—which is what every graphologist worthy the name can, and\ndoes do—he will have come to see how one sign outweighs or\ncounterbalances another, and so learn to read a human character from\na sheet of paper and the more or less erratic tracings of a pen As a home entertainment, any amount of fun is to be got out of it One unfailing source of amusement is to notice how all are willing\nvaguely to accept the ownership of every failing save the one you\nascribe to them The jealous girl is “perfectly horrid,” she knows But she certainly\n“isn’t jealous ” The lazy man is “bad tempered, perhaps,” but “no one\ncould call him indolent ”\nFriends and relations will, however, be ready to assure you of the\ncorrectness of your delineation The first thing to notice when studying character from handwriting,\nis the direction of a hand Is it even, upward, or tending to meander\ndown the page The even hand suggests honesty, conscientiousness,\nand a calm, well-balanced nature The upward hand tells of will\n\n\npower and ambition, cheerfulness and energy The hand that slopes\ndownward tells of a timid and weak nature, depression and\nmelancholy It must always be remembered, however, that temporary\nill-health, and even a temporary wave of depression, will frequently\nalter the direction of a hand Sometimes a beginner is puzzled by the varying direction—now\nupward, now downward—of a hand; generally this betokens a mind\nstruggling at the time with adverse circumstances or ill-health Capital letters and terminals are both important The more clearly\nformed and beautiful the letter, the more refined and artistic the\nnature The graphologist picks out certain letters as being especially\nimportant—M, A, L, and D in the capital letters The small d and e in\nterminal letters are certainly the most important The Principal Letters\nTaken in alphabetical order, the following are the principal letters\nto\nstudy:—\nA Well made, and simple in outline, indicates refinement,\ngentleness, intelligence, perhaps poetic feelings Flourishes are always\nbad, and tell of pretension and egotism If a small a is unjoined—\nopen-mouthed as it were—the subject is something of a gossip This\nalso applies to the small o",
    "This\nalso applies to the small o A\nArtistic—refined—loves poetry Selfish and egotistical B This is a letter that frequently tells of ostentation and kindred\nfailings If the small b is well looped, look for an affectionate nature C A well-rounded C shows a kindly, perhaps indolent nature A\ncurly tail suggests selfishness and egotism D The small d is very truth-telling A small d united to the letter\nfollowing shows a good sequence of ideas Too much flourish tells of\n\n\nan ill-balanced imagination E The capital letter shows egotism, even as the letter C does, in the\ncurled back tail A long tail to the small e tells of imagination, good-\nnature, ardor; if exaggerated, carelessness M is the next really important letter—in some respects the most\nimportant The first high loop means ambition, pride, discontent A\nbig flourish to the termination shows egotism; a moderate one force of\ncharacter T, or rather the particular method of crossing the T, is always of\nimmense interest to the graphologist Energy, strength of will, temper,\nperseverance, obstinacy, may all be shown or found to be lacking The\nthickly crossed T indicates energy; the little hook back at the end,\nperseverance; a thick abrupt ending, temper Impulsive people cross\ntheir T’s high Those who make long bars are energetic and quick in\nthinking M\nEgotist M\nForce of character Quick-tempered, willful and persevering Wide \nspacing \nbetween \nlines \nsuggests \nextravagant \ntastes;\naccompanied by rounded terminals to the letters, good-nature and\ngenerosity Short tails and a tendency to make as much as possible out of a\nsheet of paper, show the opposite characteristic Misleading Signs\nIt cannot be too emphatically impressed on the beginner, that it is\nfatal to judge from one sign alone Study them all ere you commit\nyourself to an opinion; above all, study the signature A specimen for delineation should always consist of about six lines,\n\n\nnot of copied matter It must be written on unlined paper, and have\nthe writer’s usual signature attached Never attempt to gather anything from an envelope, as one is so\noften asked to do Like copied matter, or indeed anything written\nspecially to order, it is hopelessly misleading Flourishes always show a certain vulgarity of mind A small and\ngraceful one after the signature—particularly in the case of a woman\n—is, however, quite pardonable, and is indicative merely of love of\npraise and appreciation Thick and heavy marks of punctuation are\none of the signs of a passionate nature Caution and careful attention\nto detail are shown by stops between initials and after the signature,\nthe careful crossing of T’s and dotting of I’s Frank, impulsive natures\nseldom, if ever, close their A’s and O’s Benevolent—kind-hearted, very refined, a poor one at keeping a secret,\ndevoted to those she loves Tender-hearted people invariably slope their writing, and make\nlong tails and loops The critic divides his letters The orator and\nwriter invariably join theirs, and carry them on from word to word,\neven as the sequence of their thoughts follows on Suggests an affectionate nature—one who would be greatly influenced by his\nfriends Critical—rather impulsive; a good worker at things he likes Loves\nbeauty and can keep his own counsel As a general rule, the more charmingly clear the handwriting, the\nmore straightforward and cultivated the person Eccentricity, however,\nnaturally mars many of the cleverest hands It will perhaps simplify matters for the student, if a list is compiled\nof the principal human virtues and failings, and the means of\ndiscovering them by the handwriting,\ndescribed:—\nAmbition —This is shown in the upward tendency of the hand Should will power be lacking, expect discontent Business —A businesslike person is always to be recognized by the\ncare of such details as stops, spacing, crossing of T’s, the general air of\nlaw and order in the hand Look for perseverance and will power to\n\n\ninsure success Diplomatic, lacking in will power, possessing extravagant tastes, greatly\ninfluenced by the opposite sex Brutality —Thick, heavy, ungraceful handwriting, impulsive and\nlacking in intelligence Candor —Clear, well-spaced lines and open rounded letters Well\nand firmly crossed T’s Caution —See Business Coldness —Upright hand, closed up letters, no graceful “loop ”\nCriticism —This is often found allied to a good sequence of ideas The separated letters of criticism and the carried on T crosses, &c ,\nbetray the quick thinker Deceit —This is always indicated by the screwed-up, badly-formed\nletters, that run into one another; lines uneven, and words that trail\noff into a mere scrawl Determination is shown by the firmly crossed T, and the general\nfirmness of the whole handwriting Eccentricity —Always betrays itself in a weird signature Economy,\nshort tails; careful hand, short terminals Egotism —Look for a flourish—for the curl back in capital C’s and\nE’s; for the curled back small d Extravagance —Wide margins and spacing, a rounded, rather\nflourishing hand; few stops; generally somewhat thick Compare other\nsigns Fun —The love of fun is usually indicated by quaintly-rounded\nterminals and oddly shaped, and often rather illegible capitals Generosity —Curled up terminals, bounded hand, M’s and N’s\nwritten like U’s Honor —Even handwriting; might almost have been written over\nlines See Candor; and for honesty also Imagination —Good capitals; small d’s joined to following letter bear\na hurried look; flying crosses to T’s Indolence —Bounded hand; short terminals Intelligence —Shown by the small attractive hand; clear and firm\ngood capitals Jealousy —A weak hand; sloping, long-looped, flyaway T’s; egotistic\n\n\nC’s Loyalty —Of course you cannot expect to find much character in\nhandwriting until the age of seventeen or so, but the lad who is loyal\nto his friends and his sense of duty—the typical Boy Scout’s hand, for\nexample—will ever be found firm and boldly ascending the sheet Melancholy —Downward tendency, not only to lines but even\nwords Music —Look for imagination, tenderness, and refinement Neatness —Easily to be seen Obstinacy —Heavy; crushed down as it were on an imaginary line;\nthick Originality —Imagination marked; unique capitals and flourishes Pride —The exaggerated first loop to the M Possesses good sequence of ideas; clever, vivacious, good-natured and\ndevoted Perseverance —Clear running hand; well crossed T’s, with little hook\nto end their crossing Selfishness —Upright hand, generally heavy Sensitiveness —A very sloped, rather weak, and long-looped hand Temper —Thickly crossed, flying T’s; uneven and rather angular\nhandwriting Truth —See Candor Vanity —Look for flourish beneath signature Will Power —Straight thick little bar under signature; thickly\ncrossed T’s; purposeful-looking hand; no return to tails of G’s and Y’s In conclusion, one might truthfully say that the more closely one\nstudies the handwriting of one’s friends, the more converted must one\nbecome to the belief in Graphology Go slowly Compare carefully Remember always that human beings inevitably suffer from the faults\nof their qualities, therefore search and you will be rewarded by the\nenthusiasm of those to whom you give your delineations Very intelligent, quick-tempered, imaginative, impulsive, very refined,\ngenerous, yet knows the value of money CHAPTER LVIII\nA SUCCESSFUL CHILDREN’S PARTY\nA Word to Grown-Ups\nIt is undoubtedly one of the hardest tasks imaginable to give a\nsuccessful children’s party, and the reasons that militate against\nsuccess are legion In the first place children are the keenest of critics; secondly, that\nwhich interests a mite of three will bring boredom unmitigated to the\n“fellow of ten,” while the maiden of twelve and the “man” of fifteen\nhave very strong views of their own on the subject of amusements A children’s party, then, is not an undertaking to be approached\nlightly It is of course an easy matter to hire the services of a\nventriloquist or a conjurer or some public entertainer for the\nafternoon, and leave the rest to luck, yet how many hostesses have\ncome to grief on the rocks of such an enterprise And let it be remembered that it is an absolute impossibility to\nprovide an entertainment that will appeal equally to children ranging\nfrom three to fifteen Only a section will appreciate the show Far\nbetter to let the youngsters be their own entertainers It may of course be presumed that no one will dream of giving a\nchildren’s party who is the occupant of a very small house Twenty\nchildren want more room than fifty adults This is a truism that\ncannot be too strongly emphasized Having fixed upon the date for your party and having sent out the\ninvitations, you will, wise general that you are, take complete stock of\nyour field of campaign, and make up your mind that at least four\nrooms will have to be more or less gutted to receive the host of\nyouthful invaders you are about to summon forth Let it be supposed that you have in your house three sitting-rooms The dining-room will be the refreshment room, the parlor, stripped of\nall breakables and needless accessories, for the older children to play\nin, the morning room to be converted into a dressing-room Upstairs it\nwill be as well to transform a bedroom into a play-room for the tiny\ntots and their nurses There is one fatal mistake that hostesses are sometimes guilty of in\ngiving a children’s party,—they ask their guests to come too early and\nsend them away too late The secret of success with children lies in\nthe one hackneyed sentence: “Enough is as good as a feast ” Children\nare easily tired, and they can crowd into three hours as much healthy\nenjoyment as would certainly not be the case were another hour to be\ngiven them If your young guests leave you with regret you do not\nwant any more thanks; if they fly to get their coats and hats, all your\nlabors, no matter how sincere and arduous they may have been, will\nhave been spent in vain From four till seven P M will be found quite long enough, with tea\nat half-past four Here again lies another fatal pitfall Avoid kickshaws —digestion-ruining cream cakes and jam puffs particularly Bread and\nbutter, chocolate biscuits, plain cakes, and sponge cakes produce no ill\neffects Such advice as this may provoke a scornful laugh from the\nwould-be hostess who reads these lines “Teach me how to feed\nchildren ” I hear her say “What presumption ” Yet it is homely advice\nthat is the most useful, the most disregarded when all is said and\ndone Tea Time\nHalf-past four will be found a good time for tea Soon after five the\nhealthiest hunger will have been appeased, and then, having “let\ndigestion wait on appetite,” marshal your guests into the drawing-\nroom and allow them to “fall to” to amuse themselves Let the revels be of the simplest If there is one game children love\nmore than another it is Musical Chairs, and as there cannot be a\nperson living, who does not know that historic pastime, there will be\nno need to describe it in detail However, among your young guests you will be sure to find one or\ntwo boys who do not care to play the game, yet who can be made\nexceedingly useful in another way as “umpires ” Most boys of fourteen\nor fifteen have a great sense of honor when games are under\nconsideration; let two boys, then, be the arbiters of the sport—let\nthem decide whether, when the music stopped, Tommy found a seat\nbefore Johnny, or whether Billy was too rough when he pushed Mary\naside and took the seat that should have been hers You will have no\nneed to grumble at the impartiality or the reverse of the young\n\n\numpires After Musical Chairs, what better than Blind Man’s Buff, a game\nthat never stales, made more exciting if “Buff,” after having caught a\nvictim, fails to identify his prey, and must therefore pay a forfeit to be\nchosen by his captive Children love forfeits Hissing and Clapping, Dumb Crambo, Acting Proverbs—there is no\nend to the games that children love And let them choose their own You will add a thousandfold to the success of your party if you allow\nyour guests to please themselves, and by so doing you will give\nyourself far more pleasure than would be the case if you “fussed\nabout” arranging, directing, ordering Children love responsibility as\nmuch as “grown-ups ”\nAbove all, remember that “Boys will be boys ” It is only with the\ngreatest tact that you will be able to eliminate the boisterous element,\nwhich will crop up now and again in the best regulated parties If you\ncan enlist in your services some jolly bachelor who loves children, and\nwho can romp with them as a child, you will have solved the problem\nof keeping down the rowdy element A man of this stamp can work\nwonders with an obstreperous youngster, can smooth out the creases\nin your handiwork, can keep things at concert pitch, and if at the end\nof the party he is a worn-out and exhausted wreck—being who he is,\nhe won’t mind So seven o’clock comes The time for farewells has arrived Wraps\nand coats must be put on, and the little ones, flushed, excited, happy,\nare dispatched to their various homes “Thank you so much, it has been fun ” “We’ve had a ripping time,\nthank you ” “It’s been splendid ” Such thanks as these will repay you\nfor three hours of babel and pandemonium, for all the forethought\nand tact you have brought to bear on a by no means too easy task CHAPTER LIX\nPARLOR GAMES\nFor Christmas Parties\nAt Christmas parties, at which guests of all ages are found, it is\nsometimes a perplexing riddle to the hostess to know how to entertain\nthem all Musical items which may delight the older members of the\ncompany may only serve to render younger folk restless and dull, and\ndancing is not always possible in rooms of limited size Moreover,\nthere are still many young folk who are unable to set their feet nimbly\nto waltz and two-step, and would much prefer a romp to whirling\nround in time to a measure Self-consciousness and shyness are usually very evident when the\nparty enters the drawing-room, and this coating of ice, if not thawed\nquickly, will rapidly freeze into impenetrable restraint and gloom At\nsuch times a good game, quickly organized, is invaluable The rules\nshould be explained by the hostess in so simple a manner that the\nyoungest person present can follow them, and everything necessary\nshould be arranged beforehand to avoid awkward delays and pauses The Clothes-pin Game\nThe players are formed into two lines a few feet apart; at the top\nand bottom of the lines are two tables upon which as many pins as\nthere are players are placed, and exactly divided into two heaps The\nhands of all are crossed at the wrists The first players of each line use\nthe second player’s right hand to pick up a pin The latter in the same\nway passes it to the next player, and in this manner it goes through\nthe lines to the table at the end, upon which the last players place it Meanwhile, of course, the first players are sending other pins down\nthe rows The line that succeeds in removing all the pins in the heap from one\ntable to the other in the shortest time wins the game The fun lies in\nthe awkward manipulation of one’s neighbor’s hand Should a pin be\ndropped in the process, it must be picked up by the umpire and\nreturned to the top table, and throughout the game the wrists must be\n\n\nkept crossed Proverbs\nOne of the party retires while the rest decide upon a well-known\nproverb When he returns, he stands in the center of a semicircle Some one taps three times with a stick, and at the third tap each\nplayer shouts one word of the proverb loudly and simultaneously This is repeated three times, and it is amazing how difficult it is to\ndistinguish even the most well-known proverb in the uproar Should one word give the key to the player not in the secret, the\nindividual who speaks it takes his place For instance, in the proverb,\n“All is not gold that glitters,” it may happen that the word “glitters”\nprovides the keynote Therefore, he or she who speaks it takes the\nplace of the one who guesses The proverb must contain as many words as there are players, and\neach shouts only the one word allotted to him The Game of Shadows\nA white sheet is stretched against the wall, with a lamp\nimmediately before it All other lights are extinguished One of the\ncompany sits on a chair or stool with eyes fixed on the sheet Behind\nhim the company files noiselessly, the while he endeavors to identify\nthem by means of the shadows silhouetted on the screen Simple disguises are allowable and increase the fun For example, a\nboy may don a girl’s hat, a girl a boy’s; or a skirt or shawl may be\ndraped over a boy’s suit, thus concealing the wearer’s identity The\none whose shadow betrays her takes the place of the player who\nidentifies her Gardeners\nTwo rows, headed by a chosen captain, face each other In turn they\nfire at each other the names of vegetable, flowers, or fruit, beginning\nwith the letter A, and using in turn the other letters of the alphabet—\nasparagus, artichokes, apples, &c",
    "In turn they\nfire at each other the names of vegetable, flowers, or fruit, beginning\nwith the letter A, and using in turn the other letters of the alphabet—\nasparagus, artichokes, apples, &c The players on each side set their wits to work to aid their captain\n\n\nwhen he shows signs of faltering They are not allowed to speak\naloud, their promptings being given in whispers, and this is where the\nfun comes in, for, when one is excited and eager to give a word, it is\nvery difficult to remember to whisper, especially when placed at the\ntail of the line When a gardener and his side pause to remember a word the\nopposite side counts twenty slowly; if at the end of that time their\nopponents still fail they forfeit a man The game goes on until one\ncaptain has secured all his adversaries’ followers Should any one\nexcept the leaders speak aloud, he or she is obliged to cross to the\nother party When a captain surrenders he is obliged to go to the end of the line,\nand the next man takes his place and responsibilities When a captain surrenders he is obliged to go to the end of the line,\nand the next man takes his place and responsibilities Wild flowers or\nplants are not allowed Wild flowers or\nplants are not allowed Tidings\nEach player adopts some trade or profession One member reads out\nthe social gossip from a daily paper When he pauses and points at\none of the rest, that one must reply quickly some sentence regarding\nhis calling or the stock he sells, for\ninstance—\nReader",
    "When he pauses and points at\none of the rest, that one must reply quickly some sentence regarding\nhis calling or the stock he sells, for\ninstance—\nReader —The ball that took place at the residence of the Hon Mrs Mortimer last evening was distinguished by the presence of the\nPresident A number of débutantes were present, the majority of whom were\ndressed in—Here the reader glances at the carpenter, who answers,\n“Shavings ”\nReader—“Their headgear consisted of (glances at the\nfruiterer)—\nFruiterer—“Pine-apples ”\nReader—“Their jewels were necklaces (glances at the\nironmonger)—\nIronmonger—“Of nails ”\nReader—“The dancing took place\nin—\nTobacconist—“A cigar box ”\nReader—“The walls of which were richly decorated\nwith—\n\n\nLawyer—“Red tape ”\nReader—“The band was composed of forty instruments\nall—\nDoctor—“Medicine bottles ”\nReader—“The President’s first partner\nwas—\nFishmonger—“A codfish ”\nReader—“Who was most becomingly clad\nin—\nDruggist—“Silver scales ”\nReader—“Her bouquet was composed\nof—\nDry Goods Merchant—“Spools of cotton ”\nReader—“And her tiny feet were cased\nin—\nMason—“Bricks ”\nReader—“Her dancing was as light\nas—\nPlumber—“A gas escape ”\nReader—“And her charming smiles showed to view a perfect set\nof—\nBootmaker—“Black heels ”\nIt can be imagined from this example the merriment and laughter\nsimilar answers evoke The Lawyer\nThe party is divided into two rows, through which walks the\nlawyer He asks a number of questions, and the answers may contain\nany words except “yes,” “no,” “white,” “black ”\nThe person to whom he puts his query does not reply, but the one\nimmediately opposite does The lawyer exchanges places with the one who makes the first\nmistake An Example\nLawyer (pointing to Mary)—“Your hair is very long; is it your own ”\n\n\nTom opposite bawls “false ”\nTo Jessie—“Do these pretty boots pinch your feet ”\nJack—“Of course, they are two sizes too small ”\nTo John—“Did you use your razor this morning ”\nJane—“He hasn’t any hair to cut ”\nTo Timothy—“Is your nurse waiting to put you to bed ”\nElsie—“Naturally—he goes to bed at seven ”\nTo Dick—“What would you like on your next birthday ”\nEthel—“A rattle ”\nTo James—“What is your favorite pastime ”\nAlice—“Putting dolly to bed ”\nTo Freda—“What is the color of your face ”\nAndrew (afraid to say “white” for fear of forfeit)—“Green ”\nCabbages\nAny number of players can take part in this game They kneel in a\ncircle on the floor with fingers stretched out before them and thumbs\ntucked in The game is started by the leader’s query to her neighbor: “Can you\nplay cabbages ”\nAs the latter has not been initiated into the mysteries of the game,\nshe at once\nreplies—\n“No ”\nThe question is asked by each player, and is always answered in the\nnegative until the circle is completed, when the leader again queries:\n“Can you play cabbages ”\nNeighbor—“No ”\nLeader (suddenly)—“Then why on earth are we sitting here ”\nThe blank expressions which result in this query are ludicrous in the\nextreme, and are followed by bursts of merriment The Lover’s Coming\nAll the members of the party save one are massed together at the\nend of the room The leader walks close to them, and throws a light\n\n\nrubber ball towards any person she likes The person must be prepared to catch the ball As the leader throws\nit, she accompanies the action with these words, “My lover comes\nthus”—the ball is tossed in a way to illustrate the manner of the\nsupposed lover The thrower terminates her sentence by a letter of the\nalphabet The one to whom the ball is thrown has to provide an\nadjective beginning with the given letter as she catches the ball—thus:\nLeader—“My lover comes g”—(throws ball) Catcher—“Gayly”—(tosses ball back) Leader—“My lover comes h ”\nCatcher—“Hopping ”\nLeader—“My lover comes o ”\nCatcher—“One-eyed ”\nLeader—“My lover comes s ”\nCatcher—“Smirking ”\nExcitement is caused by the difficulty in producing a word at a\nmoment’s notice, and being ready to catch the ball at the same time Telegrams\nEach player is provided with paper and pencil, upon which any\ntwelve letters are written, with sufficient space left between for\nwords The leader gives a topic, such as a wedding, accident, invitation,\n&c A watch is placed on the table, and from ten to fifteen minutes\ngiven, during which each player concocts a telegram from the letters\nsupplied by his left-hand neighbor At a signal, the telegrams are thrust under a hat, and read out in\nturn by the leader Example 1 —Topic: a sensational robbery S B O B H M J P K I P H From these letters may be devised the following telegram:—\n\n\n“Serious burglary; one box hairpins missing Jane prostrate; kindly\ninform police—Henry ”\nExample 2 —Topic: a catastrophe C A S D P B C A B Q D W “Cat ate Sunday dinner Please bring cheese and bread; quite\ndistracted—Wifie ”\nThe funnier the telegram, the greater the laughter when it is read\nout The Fan Fight\nThe players divide into two lines A piece of tape is stretched across\nthe room, and before every two players a feather is placed Each\nplayer possesses a Japanese fan, and the object is to lift the feather\nand waft it on to a stretch of newspaper, which marks the opponents’\nden The dens are guarded by goal-keepers, also armed with fans, and\ntheir business is a lively one Feathers must not be blown, or pushed with the hand, as happens\nsometimes when the excitement of the game makes one forgetful of all\nelse but the threatening direction the feather is taking Only the fan is\nto be used The feathers should be of different colors When one of a side\nsucceeds in driving a feather into the opposite den, he and his\nadversary retire from the game, but naturally they share the\nprevailing excitement and watch every movement of their respective\nsides, cheering and encouraging them to win When the feathers belonging to one side are all captured in a den,\nthe other side is conqueror Panama Canal\n\n\nOne of the company is chosen as director, and addresses the\ncompany in some such way as\nthis:—\n“Ladies and Gentlemen,—It having been discovered by the director\nof the Panama Canal Company that the water of the canal is often\ndisturbed to a dangerous degree by means of the passionate sighs and\nturbulent emotions of the passengers cruising upon it, they have\ndecided that a penitentiary tax shall be levied upon all ships\ncontaining lovers, and that, for every kiss given, toll shall be exacted ”\nThe company now pass slowly before the director, who asks each\nquestions as to the name, destination, cargo, number and description\nof passengers, and any other questions relating to vessels which may\noccur to him No answer must contain the letter K, for this being the initial letter\nof “kiss” is forbidden, and the person who uses it is obliged to pay any\nforfeit demanded by the captain A few questions and answers might run like\nthis:—\nCaptain to passing\nfigure—\n“What have you in your ship ”\n“Tomatoes ”\n“Where do you hail from ”\n“Liverpool ”\n“To which port are you sailing ”\n“Boston ”\n“Have you any girls on board,” &c &c Of course, the captain’s aim is to force “the ships” to introduce the\nletter K in their answers The Longest Line\nThis is a good competitive game Men and boys should stand with\ntheir feet on a chalked line Each must stoop down to a half-sitting\nposition, and with the left hand resting on the knee and the right hand\ninserted beneath the right leg, draw a line as long as possible without\nrising or using the left hand Musical Buff\n\n\nStation a person in each corner of the apartment Then blindfold\none of the party, and lead him to the center The master of the ceremonies points to each of the four in\nsuccession, and each says in a clear separate tone the word “Come ”\nWhen the word has been said by each in turn, the blind man\nendeavors to find his way towards the person who spoke first Magic Hieroglyphics\nFor this seemingly mysterious achievement a confederate is\nrequired He must know\nthat—\nA  is shown by  one tap, \nbecause it is the  first vowel E \n„\n two taps, \n„\n„\n second vowel I \n„\n three taps, \n„\n„\n third vowel O \n„\n four taps, \n„\n„\n fourth vowel U \n„\n five taps, \n„\n„\n fifth vowel Consonants are revealed by means of sentences, which the wizard\nspeaks in a natural and unostentatious manner The confederate is banished from the room while the party decide\nupon the word he shall be called upon to guess",

    "Or in Fig 4, A B is surely longer than C D They are\nidentical Or take Fig 5, A is clearly farther from B than C is from B,\nand yet A B and B C are of the same length Fig 3 —Is A C longer than B D The truth is that your eye is so confused by these different lines that\nit is wholly unable to form any clear estimate of how great the\ndistances really are This is shown even more clearly in Fig 6\n(technically known as Zollner’s lines), where you see A B and C D,\nwhich have every appearance of being about to meet shortly in the\ndirection of A C Now if you will measure the distances between B D\nand A C you will find that the lines are exactly parallel, but the eye\nhas been so deceived by the little cross lines running in different\ndirections, that it seems incredible the two thick lines are not inclined\ntowards one another at quite a considerable angle Fig 4 —Which is longer—A B or C D Fig 5 —The distance from A to B is the same as B to C Fig 6 —Zollner’s lines Hills that Don’t Rise\nShould it ever happen that you go cycling in France, you will find\nthis deception practiced upon your eyes all day long The roads in that\ncountry are very straight, and are bordered upon either side by tall\ntrees, so that from wherever you stand a long avenue stretches before\nyou to a point where the trees seem to merge into one another, as\nparallel lines invariably appear to do But flat as the country may be,\nyou will always find yourself confronted with a gentle incline, as it\nseems, very slight but none the less perceptible You brace for a long\nand steady climb, yet somehow, as you cover the ground, the hill\nseems always before you and yet there is no noticeable ascent The\nreason is simple There is no ascent The borders of trees, like the little\nlines in Fig 6, deceive the eyes in a similar way until it is almost\nimpossible to believe that the hill is merely an optical illusion, and\nthat the road is flat as the proverbial pancake There is another trick the eye is very fond of playing us A straight\nline, held on a level with the eye appears very much shorter than it\nreally is Look at Fig 7, which appears to represent a number of pins\nlying with their points towards you Now lift the book to the level of\nthe eyes, close the right one, and they will appear to be sticking\nupright in the page What a jumble of lines there is in Fig 8, something like a spider’s\nweb, and one can make nothing out of it But lift the book up, as in\nthe last example, and close one eye—the letters are plain enough, are\nthey not You have played a trick on your own eye, and made its\nhabit of shortening lines serve to interpret a message that would\notherwise be unintelligible Fig 7 —The standing pins Fig 8 —“Yes or no ”\n \nThe Stars don’t Twinkle\nEvery cloudless night the eyes make a mistake that we can easily\ndiscover, but which we are totally unable to remedy Of course you have looked up to the sky thousands of times and\nseen the stars twinkling Not only that, but if the night is clear you\ncan see they are stellate, or star-shaped, like the starfish which is\nnamed after them You can see both of these things, and yet the\nstrange fact is that neither of them is true The stars do not twinkle at all, and they are not stellate The\ntwinkling is the result of the intervening atmosphere, and not the fault\nof our eyes; but the second error can be easily brought home to our\nuntrustworthy organs of vision by the following experiment Fig 9 —The illusion of the stars Take a piece of tinfoil and prick a small hole with the point of a pin Now when it is dark put a candle behind the tinfoil in such a way that\nthe light comes through the tiny hole Hold the tinfoil about ten\ninches from your face, and the hole will appear irregular If you bring\nit nearer, it will lose even the least resemblance to a hole and appear\nas a star Of course you know perfectly well that it is round, but your\neyes have deceived you once more in the same way that they deceive\nyou every starlight night, and the little hole looks something like Fig 9—varying slightly with each individual observer This deception, or\nto put it charitably, this mistake of the eyes, is given the very high-\nsounding name of “irregular astigmatism,” but for all that it is an\nillusion pure and simple Like many well-trained servants, the eyes are quite at a loss if\nanything contrary to the usual routine is presented to them They\nknow perfectly well the laws of perspective,—how in the ordinary\ncourse of nature these laws are never broken by a hairbreadth They\nare therefore accustomed to judge in the fraction of an instant the size\nof an object by its apparent distance away That this is the result of\npractice can be easily seen from the fact that very young creatures—\n\n\nhuman and otherwise—have no idea of the relative distances of\nobjects, and strain to touch a distant gas-light, or, like a young calf,\nrush headlong into a neighboring wall which their green young fancy\ndeludes them into thinking is really some distance away But as we\ngrow older we learn many things, and perspective amongst others The Dwarf, the Man, and the Giant\nNow if we make a drawing such as Fig 10, which represents three\nmen walking down a passage, our eyes know quite well that if all\nthese men were of the same size, Mr Jones in front would appear\nsmaller than Mr Smith behind him And Mr Smith in his turn would\nappear smaller than Brown who closes the procession Yet in our illustration Jones appears a veritable giant, towering\nabove Smith and making Brown appear a mere pigmy If you measure\nthem, you will find they are all three the same size The reason of the deception is this The lines showing the passage\ndisappearing into the far distance immediately suggest to the eye the\ncorrect perspective, and, knowing the laws of that perspective, the eye\nis perfectly convinced that if all three were the same size, Brown in\nthe rear would appear proportionately bigger than Jones As he does\nnot do so, the eye immediately leaps to the conclusion that he must be\nvery much smaller It therefore telegraphs to the brain that Brown is a\ndwarf, following in the tracks of an ordinary man and a giant Fig 10 —The dwarf, the man, and the giant Color Illusions\nMost of us know the result of turning a series of circles (as in Fig 11) horizontally with the eye The circles appear to revolve rapidly\nround their center, and in different directions This is solely because\nthe eyes become confused, giving one more proof, were it needed,\nthat they are no more infallible than anything else on this wide earth Some very interesting experiments in color illusions can be made So cunning is the deception played upon us by our eyes, it is\nextremely difficult to believe that some of the tints we see in the\nexperiments are but imaginary Fig 11 —Revolving circles Fig 12 —The color top In Fig 12 you see a top which can be constructed of cardboard in\nthis way Take a postcard and cut a circle, upon which you draw a\ndiameter as A B Black the part A C B with India ink, and divide the\nother half into four equal portions by lightly penciling the radii G E, G\nD, and G F Now, still using your India ink, make arcs in these four\ndivisions in the same way as is shown in the figure Fig 13 —To make black print red Having done this carefully and rubbed out the pencil radii when the\nink has dried, put a pin through the center G from the back, so that\nthe card can easily revolve whilst the pin-head prevents it from falling\noff Your color top is now ready Make it turn rapidly upon the pin;\nlook closely at the card and what do you see The inner circles\n\n\nbecome red and the outer ones blue And yet you know perfectly well\nthat the only colors really upon the card are black and white You can make another top, after a similar fashion Cut your\npostcard as before, making one half of it black Now, out of the white\nside, cut a segment with an angle of 45 degrees, leaving a little piece\nnear the center as shown in Fig",
    "Now, out of the white\nside, cut a segment with an angle of 45 degrees, leaving a little piece\nnear the center as shown in Fig 13 13 This piece you have left has\nnothing to do with the effect, but is simply to make the top revolve\nbetter Take an ordinary book, of which the printing is presumably black,\nand revolve the top upon the pin at the rate of about five turns a\nsecond (a sharp twitch with the finger will do this perfectly well) If\nyou look at the printing now you will find the letters are colored red,\nas though the book had been printed in red ink In both these experiments the alternation of black and white has\nnot only confused the eye, but has deceived it into seeing colors\nwhich do not really exist So we have shown very conclusively that the old proverb, “all is not\ngold that glitters,” can be applied to even the plainest of black and\nwhite; and, as the poet remarks, “things are not what they seem ”\nTherefore, when people wish to impress you with the evidence of\ntheir own eyes and clinch an argument by stating that they saw such\nand such a thing and cannot be wrong, show some of these optical\nillusions and demand a better proof of what they affirm, very\ncourteously assuring the dogmatist that the best of eyes are liable to\nmake mistakes CHAPTER LXIII\nCIPHERS AND CRYPTOGRAMS\nSuccessful Systems of Secret Writing\nFrom the earliest times secret writing has been considered no less\nan art than a necessity Innumerable have been the systems invented\nand the means employed to insure the secrecy of messages and\ninstructions Yet in the passage of time by far the greater number of\nthese methods of cipher has become obsolete and practically useless,\nfailing in most cases to comply with the three great necessities which\nBacon declared to be indispensable to all ciphers and cryptograms: (1)\nEasy of reading and writing; (2) difficult of solution; and (3) void of\nsuspicion Ciphers may be generally divided into two branches—code ciphers\nand letter ciphers The first of these terms refers to systems so\narranged that one group of characters represents several words or\nsentences, whilst the other term designates those cryptograms where\neach letter in every word has its corresponding symbol As letter ciphers are the more usual, and certainly the handier of\nthe two classes, examples are given of some systems which have been\nsuccessfully used at different times and for different purposes The simplest of all methods, and, for that matter, the easiest to be\ndetected, consists in having an arbitrary list of numbers, one of which\nshall represent each letter in the alphabet—e g , A appears as 4, B as\n8, C as 12, &c This plan can be varied by substituting letters for the numbers, and\nhaving each letter of the alphabet represented by another letter—e g ,\nA being substituted by G, B by L, C by Q, and so on; but the\ndisadvantages attending these very simple ciphers are so great that for\na message of any real importance the system is useless In the same way the expedient of reversing the alphabet and\nmaking A represented by Z, B by Y, C by X, is too simple and\ngenerally known to require further description One of the easiest and earliest ciphers is shown in Fig 1 This is\nwritten in the following manner: The “bounding” lines in which the\ndesired letters are contained are drawn and the position of the letter\n\n\nin them indicated by a dot Taking, for example, Fig 1, A would be\none dot, B two, and C three dots inscribed inside the two lines\nforming the angle Thus the word CIPHER would be written C I P H E\nR At this point it might be remarked that in all the examples here\ngiven the letters are arranged in their simplest order—that of\nalphabetical sequence; whereas, for practical purposes, they can be\narranged in any form desired, the more complicated the better To\nillustrate this Fig 2 shows another arrangement of the letters, by\nusing which the same word would appear C I P H E R A B C\nJ K L\nS T U\nD E F\nM N O\nV W X\nG H I\nP Q R\nY Z\nFig 1 —One of the earliest ciphers d j v\na o w\ne p u\nh l s\nb m r\ni y\ng k t\nc q x\nf n z\nFig 2 —Another arrangement of\ncipher shown in Fig 1 An example of another simple cipher created merely by the\ntransposition of letters is shown in Fig 3, which can be read by taking\n\n\nthe first letter of the first line, the last letter of the last line, the last\nletter of the first line, and the first letter of the last, then the last letter\nof the first line, the penultimate letter of the last, and so on When the\nletters in Fig 3 are properly transposed they will be found to read “A\nvery simple cipher ”\na y p e i e\nc e p\nh r i\nr m l s v\nFig 3 —Transposition of\nletters cipher Lord Bacon invented a cipher composed of two letters only, which,\nalthough confusing to the uninitiated, is somewhat too cumbersome\nfor any general use Supposing the two letters decided upon to be A\nand B, they are grouped into series of five and employed in the\nfollowing manner: The first letter in the alphabet, A, is represented by\nAAAAA, B becomes AAAAB, C appears as AAABA, D as AABAA Using\nthis combination, the same word “cipher” would be written AAABA,\nBBAAA, BBBBB, AABBA, ABAAA, BBBAB Amongst the easy ciphers must be mentioned that shown in Fig 4,\nwhich is used thus: In the center block of small type you find the\nletters of the word you wish to write in cipher Suppose it to be TO-\nMORROW Now in the vertical column at the side you find that the\nletter on a line with “t” is A, whilst the letter at the top of the vertical\ncolumn is G Therefore the cipher letters for “t” are AG The next\nletter, “o,” is on a line with B and under E, so the cipher letters are\nBE In a similar way “m” becomes CD, and, proceeding with the\nremaining letters in the same fashion, we obtain the whole word\nwritten in cipher thus: AG, BE, CD, BE, BF, BF, BE, CG A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n\n\nA\na\nd\ng\nk\nn\nq\nt\nx\nB\nb\ne\nh\nl\no\nr\nuv\ny\nC\nc\nf\nij\nm\np\ns\nw\nz\nFig 4 —The “two-letter” cipher 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\n2\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\n3\nk\nl\nm\nn\no\n4\np\nq\nr\ns\nt\n5\nuv\nw\nx\ny\nz\nFig 5 —The Nihilist code Russian Nihilist Code\nAn adaptation of the last-mentioned system is shown in Fig 5,\nwhere the letters at the side and top are replaced by numerals This\nmethod is very much in use amongst the Russian Nihilists, who would\ntherefore write the sentence “Plot discovered” as follows: 41, 32, 35,\n45; 14, 24, 44, 13, 35, 51, 15, 43, 15, 14 This, again, can be very much complicated by multiplying each\nnumber by the position held by the letter in the word Thus in the\nsentence just put into cipher, P is the first letter in the word “plot,” L\nis the second, O the third, T the fourth, whilst in the next word D is\nthe first, I the second, &c You therefore multiply the ciphers in the\nfirst word by 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, and deal similarly with those of\nthe second word The sentence thus treated would appear—41, 64,\n105, 180; 14, 48, 132, 52, 175, 306, 105, 344, 135, 140 To read this the system must be reversed, and each number divided\nby its position in the word Fig 6 —A musical cipher Play cipher\nA useful form of musical cipher is shown in Fig 6, which explains\nitself In using this system it is usual to separate the different words by\ndividing the notes into bars, as can be seen from a glance at Fig",
    "In using this system it is usual to separate the different words by\ndividing the notes into bars, as can be seen from a glance at Fig 7 Here it will be noticed that only crotchets and minims are used for\nciphers, whilst the other notes introduced have no significance, only\nserving the purpose of confusing whoever has sufficient curiosity to\npry into the message Therefore, discordant as the passage may sound\nto the wrong person, it probably makes very sweet music to whoever\nhas ears and eyes to understand its meaning Fig 7 —A musical appointment Play message\nBefore proceeding to more complicated ciphers, that known as the\nfractional may be mentioned This is a very simple method, and easily\nlearned The letters of the alphabet are divided into groups of five as\nshown in Fig 8, each group being marked successively up to five, and\neach letter in the group treated in the same way The numerator is\nused to designate the group to which the letter belongs, whilst the\ndenominator shows the individual letter in that group

the systems of cipher from the\nsimplest methods to the most complicated of political cryptograms Although the actual details are necessarily hidden, it may be assumed\nas a positive fact that the most secret political ciphers now in use by\n\n\ncivilized Governments are but adaptations of one or other of the\nmethods described CHAPTER LXIV\nSECRET SIGNS\nFriend from Foe\nIn a condition of affairs where every man’s hand was against his\nneighbor’s, the necessity of being able to tell friend from foe was more\nurgent than in these peaceable times When plotting was rife upon every hand, and one man possibly held\nthe lives of many confederates in his power, knowing that an\nincautious word of his might doom them all to punishment and\nprobably death, it became of paramount importance to have some\nmeans of discerning allies from enemies Obviously the means of finding out such important information\nmust be such as to awaken no suspicion in the event of a mistake,\nwhilst on the other hand there should be no possibility of a stranger\ninadvertently obtaining possession of the secret From earliest times the formation of Secret Societies has\nnecessitated the invention of Secret Signs, and in nine cases out of ten,\nit may be said, the extinction of the societies from one cause or\nanother has resulted in the loss of their secret signs of recognition There are, however, even now, several Societies or Fraternities\nwhose members are possessed of certain signs whereby they can know\neach other, and in several cases they claim lineal descent from some\nof the old fraternities whose origins are lost in antiquity However, now that universal liberty, especially in this country, has\nabolished the necessity for concealment, secret political societies have\ndisappeared, and with them their complicated systems of signs,\ntokens, and pass-words In certain colleges and schools societies still exist, and as a secret\nbond is held by many to be a very effective link in the dearest of\nfriendships, below are given a few suggestions to enable you to invent\nsome secret signs which shall be a tie between yourself and such\nfriends as you may consider worthy of initiation into their meanings Like verbs, secret signs may be roughly classed into active and\npassive Active signs are those which are given by movements of the\nlimbs or contortions of the face, whilst passive signs are connected\n\n\nentirely with the disposal of parts of the clothing or the wearing of\nvarious objects attached to the person Amongst active signs, the readiest in execution are those performed\nby the hands in view of the person, whose attention it is desired to\nattract, e g",
    "g , the signs can be given at the moment of shaking hands,\nwhere such a ceremony is observed “Shakes” and “Passes”\nIn this latter case a very good “shake” can be obtained by pressing\nthe thumb firmly against the back of the hand, as shown in Fig 1 This will arouse no suspicion in anybody ignorant of the meaning,\nthough, if reciprocated, it forms an excellent sign of recognition Fig 1 —A handshake sign Fig 2 —An eyebrow sign The variety of passes that can be executed with different meanings\nis astonishing Yet it should be remembered that, although outsiders\nmay not know what you are saying, it will always be apparent that\n“something is up,” and a very undesirable curiosity will be awakened On the other hand, there are many little actions, unnoticeable in\nthemselves, which may have a great meaning to those “in the know ”\nA simple stroking of the eyebrows (Fig 2) is to all appearances a\nharmless movement, but in the secret signs of a well-known society it\nmeant that treachery was in the air, and every person in the room\nwould have to be watched In a certain Italian Society, clasping the forehead with the left hand\nas though in extreme weariness (Fig 3) implied: “Be cautious, you are\nbeing watched ” A similar action with the right hand meant: “We are\nknown, make your escape as best you can; leave me alone ”\nIn the same society, when a member found himself in a mixed\nassembly, and desired to ascertain who amongst the guests belonged\nto his fraternity, he would stroke his left cheek thoughtfully with\nextended first and second fingers, as in Fig 4 Fig 3 —The sign of an Italian secret society Fig 4 —The “cheek” sign of an Italian secret society The brethren of a very respectable society, which still flourishes, are\ngenerally credited with knowing each other by a peculiar flourish of\nthe hand when removing the hat, in a somewhat similar manner to\nthat shown in Fig",
    "The brethren of a very respectable society, which still flourishes, are\ngenerally credited with knowing each other by a peculiar flourish of\nthe hand when removing the hat, in a somewhat similar manner to\nthat shown in Fig 5 Others make the ceremony of blowing the nose\nof like importance Fig 5 —The hat flourish —The hat flourish There used to be a famous Italian Secret Society divided into several\nclasses or degrees, each of which had its own especial sign For the\nfirst three degrees these signs were as\nfollows:—\n1st The right hand is raised to the shoulder, and then passed slowly\ndown across the body to the left knee 2nd The right hand is placed upon the left shoulder, then drawn\nslowly down the left arm until it reaches the hand Thus clasped they\nare raised to the breast 3rd The right hand is clasped, the thumb and little finger extended The former is placed against the lips, whilst the latter touches the\nbreast Those who desire to invent secret signs should avoid all those\ndependent upon an unnecessary action, like the hat-flourish It is more\nsatisfactory to apply the secret to some everyday action which, from\nits very unobtrusiveness, will attract the attention of no stranger Members of certain religious secret societies to this day distinguish\none another by a peculiar style of cross, worn as a pendant from the\nwatch-chain, whilst a pass-word is current amongst them to enable\nthem to test those whom they meet wearing the symbol The use of flowers in the button-hole is a very common method of\nattracting recognition, whilst a development of the same idea is seen\n\n\nin the wearing of different colored neckties or ribbons, which in a\ncrowd will pass unnoticed save by those whose attention is desired Yet to both of these systems a certain danger is attached, for there is\nalways the chance of some unsuspecting person quite inadvertently\nwearing the same flowers or colors Every one has heard of the language of flowers, but it is surprising\nto what an extent this can be carried by enterprising young ladies\nwith a good collection in the garden or green house It has been frequently proved that some safeguard is a necessary\naddition to the sign, and this safeguard usually takes the form of a\npass-word Repeated after the sign has been given, this word serves to\nshow that the secret sign was neither given by accident nor picked up\nthrough curiosity Pass-Words\nPass-words, and the methods of giving them, vary considerably The\nword, which must of course be known to all duly intrusted with the\nsecret, should be of two syllables One party called A says the first syllable, and the other person B\nrepeats the second, then saying the whole word Supposing the pass-\nword chosen be Oxford, A would make some remark introducing the\nword Ox, whilst B, replying in a similar vein, would mention the last\nsyllable “ford” and conclude by repeating the whole word With this\nsystem it is almost impossible for an outsider to palm himself off as\none of the elect, even if he has become acquainted with all the signs\nof the society It is a well-known fact that gypsies have a concerted plan of signals\nwhich are employed to show members of the party the direction taken\nby their leaders The “Patteran”\nThe “patteran,” as it is called, is made in various ways A piece of\nrag fluttering from some bush near a cross-road, is a favorite signal,\nwhilst small twigs or leaves strewn in a particular direction, have a\nsomewhat similar meaning Tramps and vagrants of all kinds have a series of signs, which they\n\n\nchalk upon the walls of the various houses at which they call, serving\nto inform their brethren of the treatment received at the hands of the\noccupiers By this method a rude cross will usually describe the rather chilling\nwelcome offered them by an irate householder, whilst a rough sketch\nof a loaf of bread shows that the inmates are sufficiently sympathetic\nto dispense with a portion of “the staff of life ” On the other hand, an\nupraised leg with a boot upon its foot tells a tale which need not be\nfurther enlarged upon As to the various modes of recognition that can be produced by\nwhistles and cries of all kinds, they are too familiar to require\ndescription in these pages CHAPTER LXV\nGAMES AND AMUSEMENTS FOR THE BLIND\nThe Wonderful Sense of Touch\nIt cannot fail to strike those of us who are blessed with the use of\nour eyes how extremely fortunate it is that our blind friends need not\nbe debarred from many of our games Being deprived of their sight,\ntheir sense of touch is developed to such an incredible extent that in\nthe playing of many games their fingers prove of the same use to them\nas our eyes do to us Practically all games for the blind can be purchased at very\nmoderate cost, yet as they can be quite easily made at home the\nfollowing hints are offered in the hope that they will prove of use, and\nhelp some of our readers to entertain a friend less fortunate than\nthemselves Cards\nAn ordinary pack of cards can be very simply adapted to the use of\nthe blind Fig 1 —Pin pricks showing value and suit of card Fig 2 —Distinguishing marks for suits and color respectively By means of a large pin, the designation and value of a card can be\npricked on the back, so that the upraised holes are perceptible to\ntouch These values and denominations should be pricked in the\ncorner where the small designation of the value of a card is always to\nbe found, as in Fig 1 In Figs 2 and 3 are shown the marks which should be pricked These are in the Braille alphabet, now universally understood by the\nblind, and read by them with the same ease as we read printing Fig 3 —Values to precede the signs for suits Fig 4 —Cards prepared for Patience In Whist or Bridge, each person, as he plays his card, states what it\nis, King of Hearts, and so on, as this saves feeling the cards after they\nhave been laid on the table A very suitable game, calculated to amuse the player for hours, is\nPatience, under all its forms For this the cards must be prepared\nsomewhat differently, as in many games the first thing to be\ndistinguished is the color The handiest plan is to mark a B or an R for Black or Red, in Braille\ncharacters immediately before, or underneath the denomination A\nglance at Fig 4 will serve to show what is meant With the cards thus marked, any game of Patience can be played as\neasily by a blind person as by an ordinary player Checkers\n\n\nAn ordinary Checker Board can be adapted for the use of the blind\nwith very little trouble and no expense Cut thirty-two squares of thick cardboard, each square identical in\nsize with the black squares on the Checker Board Upon each of the\nblack spaces one of these pieces of card should be glued, so that when\ncomplete the board is composed of sunk and raised instead of colored\nsquares For the convenience of any ordinary person who may be playing\nwith a blind opponent, the cardboard squares should be colored black\nwith India ink The checkers usually purchased have a molding on both top and\nbottom It will simplify matters considerably if you can buy a set with\none side only molded By using the white men with the molding\nuppermost and the black men reversed, as in Fig 5, the difference will\nbe sufficient to enable the blind person to distinguish by touch Fig 5 —Molded (white) and plain (black) draughts for the blind The same result can be obtained by glueing discs of cardboard or\nstiff paper, upon one side of each man, of one of the sets Halma\nThe preparation of a Halma board is very similar to that of a\nchecker board Having raised the alternate squares with cardboard,\nthe “Homes” at each corner should be further raised by glueing a\npiece of cardboard over all the spaces, and then raising the alternate\nsquares upon this base, as in Figs 6 and 6a Fig 6 —Section of Halma board showing “Home ”\nIn the center of each square a nail should be driven from the back\nof the board, with the end cut off and point filed to smoothness These\nnails should project from the face of the board about half an inch The\nordinary Halma men have a hole on the under side, which enables\nyou to place them upon the upraised points, where they will be held\n\n\nfirmly Fig 6a —Plan of raised corner It will now be necessary to make some alteration in the men, to\ndistinguish the colors In Fig 7 an idea of how this may be done is\ngiven The Yellow men are left untouched, Black have their heads cut\nright off, Red have one half of the head cut away, while the Green\nhave the head sharpened to a point Fig 7 —Color distinctions for Halma men Dominoes\nOwing to their construction, Dominoes really need no alteration to\nmake them suitable for the blind, but care should be taken when\npurchasing to see that the pips are cut deep into the ivory, so that the\nplayer can tell at a touch how many there are in the piece before him Chess\nThis is one of the games in which the blind frequently excel, and in\nconsequence it is a general favorite The undivided attention they are\nable to give, and the natural acuteness which their affliction usually\nbrings to such a pitch of excellence, serves them in good stead when\nplaying “the king of games ”\nThe board should be prepared as in the case of checkers, with the\nexception that points should be made from the back, in the manner\ndescribed in connection with the Halma board The different men are, of course, by their construction, easily\ndistinguishable from one another, but it will assist matters very\nmaterially if a set is used in which the men differ considerably in\nshape and size In the center of each piece a hole must be bored in the base, large\nenough to allow the man to be placed, and removed from one pin to\nanother with ease For this reason wooden chess men are preferable The question of distinguishing the colors has been solved in various\nways In some cases the tops of the men of one color have been\nhalved, as shown in Fig 8, and this has proved a very satisfactory\narrangement Fig 8 —Color distinctions for Chess men Others have used the black men of one set and the white men of\nanother, but this plan is hardly to be recommended, owing to the\nsimilarity prevailing between all chess men The following method seems to be as good as any, and has the\nadvantage of being easily contrived Drive a pin firmly into the heads\nof one set of men (say the black), and either leave plain, or make a\nlittle knob of sealing-wax around the pinhead This will render the\ndifferent colors perfectly distinguishable to the blind player Round Games\nIn the majority of round games the blind are able to take an active\npart, but this depends very much upon the individual concerned As a\ngeneral rule rough games should be avoided, especially if the space\nfor playing be limited",
    "As a\ngeneral rule rough games should be avoided, especially if the space\nfor playing be limited Fig 9 —The Braille Alphabet Games in which a certain amount of writing is requisite are rarely\nsuitable, although here again it must be a matter solely dependent\nupon the person concerned At spelling and guessing games the cleverest seeing player must\nlook to his or her laurels, for the blind are very quick-witted in such\ncontests, and frequently have the answer ready while others are still\nrepeating the question As a matter of interest as well as of use, the blind alphabet of the\nBraille system is shown in Fig 9, and by this means letters and notes\ncan be written, which will be perfectly intelligible to a blind person In pricking the characters through a paper, it should be remembered\n\n\nthat the points must be reversed, and the letters begun from right to\nleft, as the blind person will read from the other side, where the pin-\npricked holes will have raised little points of paper INDEX\nBlind, games for, 538\nAlphabet, the Braille, 543\nCards, 539\nCheckers, 540\nChess, 542\nColor distinction for Chess men, 542\nColor distinction for Halma men, 541\nDominoes,
