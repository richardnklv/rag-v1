    "Poor morphological control[14,15] and bad surface coverage of perovskite between electron\n\n\nand hole transport layers (ETL and HTL)[1,16] are known to have adverse effects on the performance of the\n\n\ndevices (see Fig 1) 1) There have been several attempts to deposit almost pinhole free and smooth perovskite\n\n\nfilms using techniques like co-evaporation[1], use of PbAc 2 [17,18], PVP (poly-vinylpyrrolidone) as\n\n\nsurfactant[19], variation in the anneal temperature[15,20] and anneal time[21], but quantitative estimates of\n\n\nlosses due to sub-optimal surface coverage are still not available in literature In this manuscript we discuss the effect of pinholes or non-ideal perovskite surface coverage on the\n\n\nefficiency through detailed optical and carrier transport simulations which are supported through an\n\n\nanalytical model as well While degradation in the performance metrics is generally anticipated due to poor\n\n\nsurface coverage or pinholes, here we show that, surprisingly, the 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 is rather independent of the pinhole\n\n\nsize distribution and is more affected by the net surface coverage However, the 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 of the device is indeed\n\n\naffected by size distribution of the pinholes as well as by net surface coverage Further, carrier\n\n\nrecombination at ETL/HTL interface (due to the absence of perovskite between them) can have interesting\n\n\nimplications, including near ideal performance for the devices with sub-optimal surface coverage Below,\n\n\nwe first describe the model system to study the effect of surface coverage on the performance of device The\n\n\nmodel is then extended to explore the effects of bad interface between perovskite and HTL We also\n\n\npropose simple schemes to estimate surface coverage from terminal I-V characteristics",
    "We also\n\n\npropose simple schemes to estimate surface coverage from terminal I-V characteristics 3\n\n\n**2 Model System**\n\n\nThe structure of a perovskite solar cell is shown in figure 1 (a) Here, the perovskite is sandwiched\n\n\nbetween ETL and HTL Non-uniform deposition of perovskite between ETL and HTL leads to empty space\n\n\nor direct contact between ETL and HTL as shown in cross-sectional view of perovskite solar cell (fig Non-uniform deposition of perovskite between ETL and HTL leads to empty space\n\n\nor direct contact between ETL and HTL as shown in cross-sectional view of perovskite solar cell (fig 1b) These regions could result in increased recombination and affect the photon absorption properties as well The fraction of area covered by perovskite between ETL/HTL is denoted as surface coverage (s) and the\n\n\nregion not covered by perovskite is referred as void in this paper Typically, poor surface coverage of\n\n\n4\n\n\nperovskite between ETL/HTL causes loss in performance due to: a) less absorption of photons and b)\n\n\nincrease in the recombination at the interface[15] As mentioned before, current literature lacks quantitative estimates of such surface coverage aspects which\n\n\nare required to accurately model the eventual device performance Given this scenario, here we make a few\n\n\nsimplifying assumptions such that the problem becomes computationally and conceptually tractable – (a) all\n\n\nvoids are uniform in size and (b) all voids are filled with HTL The corresponding scheme is shown in part\n\n\n(c) of the figure 1, which is a periodic structure whose unit cell is indicated by the dashed rectangle Accordingly, any real device can be then considered as combination of such unit cells (horizontally) of\n\n\nmany sizes and surface coverage A unit cell can be uniquely defined using the variables: a) width of the\n\n\nunit cell (𝑤) and b) surface coverage (s) (see fig 1c)",
    "1c) As per this definition, the size of a void is given by the\n\n\nterm 𝑤× 𝑠 We calculate optical and electrical characteristics of the device defined by such unit cells to explore the\n\n\neffects of non-uniform surface coverage Optical characteristics of device is obtained through numerical\n\n\nsolution of Maxwell’s equations in frequency domain[22] (eq 1)\n\n\n∇× (∇× 𝐸 𝑒𝑚 ) = 𝜅 02 (𝑛 𝑟 −𝑖𝑘) 2 𝐸 𝑒𝑚, (1)\n\n\nwhere _E_ _em_ is the electric field of electromagnetic (EM) wave, 𝜅 0 is the wave number of the free space, 𝑛 𝑟\n\n\nand 𝑘 are real and imaginary parts of refractive index, respectively 𝜅 0 is defined as 𝜅 0 = 𝜔/𝑐 0, where _ω_ is\n\n\nangular velocity of light and 𝑐 0 is the speed of light in free space EM power at any point is 𝑃=\n\n\n1\n\n2 [𝜖] [0] [𝑐|𝐸] [𝑒𝑚] [|] [2] [ The absorptance for a particular wavelength is given by the ratio of power dissipated in the ]\n\n\nperovskite to the incident power for that wavelength Here we assume that each absorbed photon results in\n\n\nthe generation of one free e-h pair in perovskite 5\n\n\nThe electrical (JV) characteristics under dark and illuminated conditions are simulated through self\n\nconsistent solutions of drift-diffusion and Poisson’s equations (see supplementary material for details) We\n\n\nhave assumed TiO 2 as ETL (225 nm thick) and spiro-MeOTAD as HTL (200 nm thick) besides 300 nm\n\n\nthick perovskite The material parameters are adopted from literature[23–25] and calibrated using detailed\n\n\nsimulations, reported elsewhere [26] For the electrical calculations we use uniform photo-generation rate\n\n\ninside the perovskite which is equivalent to generation rate obtained from optical simulations We consider\n\n\nSRH, radiative, and Auger recombination mechanisms in perovskite along with trap assisted recombination\n\n\nat ETL/HTL interface, while the bulk ETL and HTL are treated as recombination/generation free All our\n\n\nsimulations are performed using doped contact layers unless otherwise mentioned As the propagation of light depends on void size (i e, 𝑤× 𝑠), both 𝑤 and 𝑠 are of critical importance for\n\n\noptical calculations For optical simulations we have varied unit cell width (𝑤) from 100 nm to 10 μm and\n\n\nsurface coverage (𝑠) is varied from 0% to 100% Unlike the optics, the carrier transport is critically\n\n\ninfluenced by the electric field profiles and the carrier mobility Our simulations indicate the absence of any\n\n\nsignificant electric field fringing around the voids as the perovskite and HTL dielectric constants are\n\n\nassumed to be of the same order Moreover, the carrier collection lengths are typically much larger than the\n\n\nactive layer thickness Hence the JV characteristics depend primarily on 𝑠 rather 𝑤 So we have assumed\n\n\n‘𝑤’ as 1 μm for electrical transport simulations These assumptions are supported through numerical\n\n\nsimulations **3 Results and discussions**\n\n\n**3 1 Optical Characteristics:**\n\n\nNumerical solutions[27] of eq 1 for 100% surface coverage show that only about 80% of solar energy of\n\n\ninterest ( _i e _, more than perovskite band gap energy) is absorbed by perovskite while rest is lost either by\n\n\nreflection or parasitic absorption (see fig S1 for details) These results are in close agreement with previous\n\n\n6\n\n\nreports based on transfer matrix method [28] For structures with 𝑠< 100%, diffraction of light becomes an\n\n\nimportant phenomena that could influence the carrier generation rate in perovskites (see fig S2) Figure 2a\n\n\ncompares the volumetric integration of photons absorbed in the perovskite vs wavelength for different\n\n\nsurface coverages (w = 1 μm) The values are normalized with the results of device with 𝑠= 100% Here\n\n\nwe observe that photons absorbed in the perovskite increases with surface coverage, an obvious result We\n\n\nalso observe that this increase is nonlinear with ‘s’ for moderate to large wavelength regime (more than 450\n\n\nnm) Further we find that diffraction pattern is different for different wavelengths and surface coverage (see\n\n\nfig 2 and supplementary material fig S2 and S3) Figure 2b shows the effect of unit cell width on the net absorption of photons in perovskite under 1 sun\n\n\nillumination (normalized w",
    "Figure 2b shows the effect of unit cell width on the net absorption of photons in perovskite under 1 sun\n\n\nillumination (normalized w r t device with 𝑠= 100%) Here, we observe that– a) absorbed photons, in\n\n\ngeneral, increases with reduction in unit cell width, b) for the large width of unit cell, total photons absorbed\n\n\n7\n\n\nin the active layer varies linearly with surface coverage (results for w = 10 μm), and c) lower limit of\n\n\nabsorbed photons is linear with ‘𝑠’ (shown by diamonds, see supplementary material for detailed\n\n\ncalculations) Note that the lower limit for the generation rate (or equivalently the absorption rate) (𝐺) in the\n\n\nperovskite is given by the relation 𝐺(𝑠) = 𝑠× 𝐺(100) where 𝐺(100) is the generation rate of e-h pairs (s [-1] )\n\n\nin perovskite for a device with 100% surface coverage This limit assumes that negligible fraction of\n\n\nphotons incident on the void are diffracted towards the active layer All the above observations follow the fact that the ratio of the light diffracted to the total light incident on\n\n\nthe void decreases with increase in void size (void size = w × 𝑠, also see inset in fig 2b) It is expected that\n\n\nthe diffraction of light is significant if the size of the void is comparable to the wavelength of the light [22]\n\n\nWavelengths of our interest lie in the range of 300-800 nm Accordingly, we expect significant diffraction\n\n\nfor wavelengths of interest if the size of a void ≃300 nm Also, if the void size is less than the wavelength\n\n\nof the light incident, then the void acts as the circular source of the light [22] Therefore, a) for unit cells\n\n\nwith large width (𝑤= 10 μm in fig 2b), the voids are also large in size and hence net absorption of photons\n\n\nin perovskite layer varies linearly with s due to the insignificant diffraction of light, b) for cells with small\n\n\nwidth (𝑤= 0 1 μm in fig 2b), the absorption rate varies nonlinearly with s as the voids are also small in size\n\n\n(here the light incident on the void is distributed equally in all directions in the range -90° to 90° w r t direction of incidence), and c) for cells with moderate width (i e , 𝑤= 1 μm) the absorption rate varies\n\n\nlinearly with 𝑠 for large voids (i e , for 𝑠< 60%) and non-linearly with 𝑠 for small voids (i e , for 𝑠>\n\n\n70%) Interestingly, the optical simulations also show that the integrated photon absorption count in the\n\n\nperovskite for devices with ‘𝑠’ more than 70% along with unit cell size less than 1μm is similar to device\n\n\nwith 𝑠= 100% This indicates that for devices with such small pinholes, the photon absorption is very\n\n\nefficient as there is significant diffraction of light Hence, one may expect near ideal 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 for such cases An\n\n\nanalytical model to predict the effect of 𝑠 on the JV characteristics is discussed in the next section",

over the barrier transport of either type of carrier is negligible due to the presence of\n\n\nhuge barrier potential in PSCs,[29] the dark current in the device is governed mainly by the recombination\n\n\nof charge carriers in the bulk of the perovskite or at the interfaces of different layers Absence of any\n\n\nsignificant electric field fringing around the voids results in linear combination of dark current from\n\n\nETL/HTL interface and bulk perovskite Accordingly, the dark current density ( _J_ _D_ ) can be written as\n\n\n𝐽 𝐷 (𝑠) = 𝑠𝐽 𝐷 𝐸𝑃𝐻 + (1 −𝑠)𝐽 𝐷 𝐸𝐻, (2)\n\n\nwhere _EPH_ in the subscript indicate presence of perovskite between ETL and HTL and _EH_ indicate the\n\n\nabsence of perovskite Device with 𝑠= 100% forms p-i-n junction (ETL/Perovskite/HTL) and 𝑠=

_m_ ) close to 2[30] and therefore\n\n\nwe do not expect much difference in the ideality factor in 100% surface coverage and 0% surface coverage\n\n\ndevice Accordingly, eq (2) can be expressed as\n\n\n\n𝑞𝑉 𝑞𝑉\n\n𝐽 𝐷 = (𝑠𝐽 0 𝐸𝑃𝐻 + (1 −𝑠)𝐽 0 𝐸𝐻 ) exp ( 𝑚𝑘𝑇 [) = 𝐽] [0] [ exp (] 𝑚𝑘𝑇 [)][ ] (3)\n\n\n\n_JV characteristics under illumination_ : The illuminated JV characteristics of any photovoltaic device can\n\n\nbe written as sum of photocurrent (𝐽 𝑝ℎ ) and diode injection current (𝐽 𝑖𝑛𝑗 ) [31] If principle of superposition\n\n\nholds then 𝐽 𝑖𝑛𝑗 = 𝐽 𝐷 and 𝐽 𝑝ℎ = −𝐽 𝑆𝐶 It is shown in literature that proper doping of contact layers lead to\n\n\nsuperposition of light and dark JV characteristics,[26] therefore JV characteristics of the device under\n\n\nillumination ( _J_ _l_ ) is given by\n\n\n𝐽 𝑙 = −𝐽 𝑆𝐶 + 𝐽 𝐷 (4)\n\n\nUsing eqs 3 and 4 with 𝐽 𝑙 = 0, we obtain the surface coverage dependent open circuit potential as\n\n\n9\n\n\n𝑠)\n\n𝐸𝑃𝐻\n\n, (5)\n𝑠\n~~)~~\n\n\n\n𝑚𝑘𝑇\n\n𝑞

void size distribution, but the difference in the 𝑉 𝑂𝐶\n\n\nis very small (last term in equation 5) _Model Predictions_ : Though decrease in performance parameters of the device are expected with poor\n\n\nsurface coverage, we observe some interesting features based on the analytical model as listed below\n\na) **Effect on** 𝑽 𝒐𝒄 : In general, reduction in 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 is expected in the devices with pinholes due to increased\n\n\nrecombination in the device caused by ETL/HTL interface (2 [nd] term in eqs 5 and 8) Also eq 5\n\n\nindicates while the 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 has a strong dependence on surface coverage, the same has a rather weak\n\n\n10\n\n\ndependence on the void size For example, assuming β=10 along with m=2 result in ∼100 mV\n\n\nchange in Voc by changing s from 100% to 50% (𝑤= 1 μm) But ±1 order change in 𝑤 (void size\n\n\nalso changes by 1 order) for s=50% changes 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 only by ∼∓10 mV b) **Effect on** 𝑱 𝒔𝒄 : For large voids, 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 decreases with the decrease in surface coverage due to loss in\n\n\nabsorption of photons caused by partial absence of active layer But for devices with small voids, due\n\n\nto the increased generation rate in active layer (see fig 2b), we expect a nonlinear relation between 𝐽 𝑆𝐶\n\n\nand 𝑠 Also, according to discussion related to fig 2b, we expect linear relation between 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 and 𝑠 for\n\n\nvoid size larger than ~400 nm c) **FF variation** : A detailed calculation for effect of 𝑠 on the FF is provided in supplementary material According to our calculations and also from the general trend of 𝐹𝐹 vs 𝑉 𝑂𝐶, as reported in\n\n\nliterature[33], we expect a decrease in FF with decrease in surface coverage d) **Efficiency** : Finally, we expect decrease in efficiency with decrease in surface coverage due to\n\n\nreduction in 𝐽 𝑆𝐶, 𝑉 𝑂𝐶, and 𝐹𝐹 However, under limiting conditions (i e , for devices with small voids or\n\n\n\n𝐽 𝑆𝐶 (𝑠)\n\n\n𝐽 𝑆𝐶𝐸𝑃𝐻\n\n\n\n≃1, and perfect interface between ETL and HTL) the third term in RHS of eq 5 could offset\n\n\n\nthe 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 loss due to pinholes (which is the second term of eq 5)",
    "5) This indicates that nano-structured\n\n\nperovskite active layer could indeed result in better efficiency than planar devices with 100% surface\n\n\ncoverage _Simulation Results_ : In order to validate our analytical model, we solved continuity and Poisson’s equation\n\n\nusing device simulation tool, Sentaurus [34] Figure 3 shows the variation of 𝐽 0 and ideality factor with\n\n\nsurface coverage as obtained from simulation The direct interface between ETL and HTL is treated as\n\n\nrecombination layer The parameters used for simulation are provided in table S1 With these parameters\n\n\nour simulation results indicate that 𝐽 0 is higher for low surface coverage devices (see fig 3a), which is an\n\n\n11\n\n\nexpected result from our analysis We also observe linearity in 𝐽 0 with surface coverage and values\n\n\npredicted by analytical model (eq 3 and solid line in fig 3a) are very close to simulation results From our\n\n\nanalysis, we expect that the ideality factor is independent of surface coverage and the same is observed from\n\n\nsimulations (see fig 3b) As expected we also find from our simulations that dark JV characteristics are\n\n\nindependent of void size distribution (see the discussion on the effect of unit cell width in Section II)\n\n\nVariation in 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 and 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 with surface coverage, obtained from JV simulation under illumination, are\n\n\nshown in figure 4 Part (a) and (b) shows the variation in 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 and 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 with surface coverage (𝑤= 1 μm, β=\n\n\n94) Here we assume that the photo-generation rate varies linearly with the surface coverage (see the lower\n\n\nlimit calculation in Fig",
    "Here we assume that the photo-generation rate varies linearly with the surface coverage (see the lower\n\n\nlimit calculation in Fig 2) We find that the 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 varies linearly with surface coverage, which indicates that\n\n\nthe charge collection efficiency under short circuit conditions is not influenced by surface coverage The\n\n\ncorresponding open circuit voltage is plotted in figure 4b We observe a close agreement between\n\n\n12\n\n\nsimulation results and analytical expressions For 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 calculations we use ideality factor 1 7 as obtained\n\n\nfrom dark JV simulations A sharp increase in 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 for higher surface coverage (near 100%) indicates that\n\n\nthe presence of very small fraction of pinholes or voids can affects 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 to a large extent A decrease in FF\n\n\nwith increase in 𝐽 0, due to presence of bad ETL/HTL interface, in low surface coverage devices is expected\n\n\nand the same has been confirmed from the simulation results also (see fig S4 for details) The optical simulation results in Fig 2 indicated that the photon absorption rate and hence the carrier\n\n\ngeneration rate is indeed dependent on the surface coverage and size of voids Accordingly, we performed\n\n\n13\n\n\nthe device electrical simulations for 𝑤= 1 μm with carrier generation rates obtained from the\n\n\ncorresponding optical simulations (see fig 2b) The variation of 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 and 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 with the surface coverage for\n\n\n𝑤= 1 μm are plotted in fig 4c and 4d We find significant changes in 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 values as compared to the limiting\n\n\ncase (see Fig 4a) while changes in 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 values are nominal We also observe that 𝐽 𝑆𝐶 varies nonlinearly for\n\n\nsmall voids (i e , for 𝑠> 70%) and linearly with large voids (i e , for 𝑠< 65%) – which are similar to the\n\n\ntrends observed for the integrated photon absorption rates (compare fig 2b and 4c) This observation\n\n\nsupports our assumption of IQE=100% for generalized case (see eq 6) Further, we find that calculated\n\n\nvalues of 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 using equation 5 are in close agreement with the values obtained from simulation (see fig 4d) According to our analysis the difference in limiting 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 and actual 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 for w=1 μm at s=50% is 18 8 mV\n\n\nwhich is in close agreement with the simulated value (19 mV) Our simulation results also confirm the weak\n\n\ndependency of 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 on void size distribution as compared to surface coverage The corresponding FF and\n\n\nefficiency are plotted in fig S4 and we observe increasing trends for both with 𝑠 **3",
    "**3 3 Effect of HTL/ETL interface recombination:**\n\n\nWe observe from eqs 5 and 8 that 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 of the device decreases with increase in 𝛽 Also, 𝛽 is inversely\n\n\nproportional to the carrier lifetime at the interface of ETL/HTL (𝜏 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 ) when all other parameters are\n\n\nkept constant (because 𝐽 0 is inversely proportional to carrier lifetime[29]) Equation 5 indicates that 1 order\n\n\nof magnitude increase in 𝜏 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 results in 100 mV increase in open circuit voltage when 𝜏 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 <\n\n\n\n𝐽𝑆𝐶(𝑠)\n𝐽𝑆𝐶𝐸𝑃𝐻\n\n–a\n𝑠\n~~)~~\n\n\n\n𝜏 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 (𝑠= 80%), while 𝜏 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 - 𝜏 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 results in saturation of 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 to 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 𝐸𝑃𝐻 +\n\n\n\n𝑚𝑘𝑇\n\n𝑞 [ln ] ~~[(]~~\n\n\n\nvalue more than the open circuit voltage of device with 𝑠= 100% (𝑉 𝑂𝐶 𝐸𝑃𝐻 ) This is because 𝛽(1 −𝑠) +\n\n\n𝑠→𝑠 in this regime (eq 5) 5) Our simulations also show the same trends and representative data for 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 and\n\n\nefficiency with interface lifetime for 80% surface coverage (𝑤= 1 μm) are plotted in figure 5a We observe\n\n\nlogarithmic increase in 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 with the ETL/HTL interface lifetime Also we find 7 mV improvement in 𝑉 𝑂𝐶 as\n\n\n14\n\n\ncompared to device with 𝑠= 100% for 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝜏 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 /𝜏 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 ) = 2 3 while the limiting value, in the\n\n\nabsence of ETL/HTL recombination (𝛽= 0), is ~9 mV We observe a rather small improvement in\n\n\nefficiency as well for this case These results indicate that nanostructured perovskite solar cells, with\n\n\nappropriate interface engineering, could be an interesting prospect and are in broad agreement with the\n\n\nhigher efficiency for low surface coverage devices reported in literature [15] Curiously, we find that\n\n\ninterface recombination at perovskite/HTL interface do not affect the performance in any significant\n\n\nmanner",
