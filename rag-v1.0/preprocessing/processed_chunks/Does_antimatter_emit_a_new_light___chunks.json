    "Invited paper for the “International Workshop on Antimatter Gravity and Antihydrogen\nAtom Spectroscopy”, Sepino (IS), Italy, May 1996 To be published in Hyperfine Interactions # DOES ANTIMATTER EMIT A NEW LIGHT #### Ruggero Maria Santilli [1] Instituto per la Ricerca di Base Molise, Italy\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nContemporary theories of antimatter have a number of insufficiencies which stimulated the recent construction of the new isodual theory based on a certain antiisomorphic map of all (classical and quantum) formulations of matter called isoduality In this note we show that the isodual theory predicts that antimatter emits a new\nlight, called isodual light, which can be distinguished from the ordinary light emitted by matter via gravitational interactions (only) In particular, the isodual theory\npredicts that all stable antiparticles such as the isodual photon, the positron and the\nantiproton experience antigravity in the field of matter (defined as the reversal of the\nsign of the curvature tensor) The antihydrogen atom is therefore predicted to: experience antigravity in the field of Earth; emit the isodual photon; and have the same\nspectroscopy of the hydrogen atom, although subjected to an anti-isomorphic isodual\nmap In this note we also show that the isodual theory predicts that bound states of\nelementary particles and antiparticles (such as the positronium) experience ordinary\ngravitation in both fields of matter and antimatter, thus bypassing known objections\nagainst antigravity A number of intriguing and fundamental, open theoretical and\nexperimental problems of “the new physics of antimatter” are pointed out ### 1 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nSince the time of Dirac’s prediction of antiparticles and their detection by Anderson (see [1]\nfor historical accounts ), the theory of antimatter has been essentially developed at the level\nof second quantization This occurrence has created an unbalance between the theories of matter and antimatter\nat the classical and first quantization levels, as well as a number of shortcomings, such as\n\n\n1 Permanent address: Institute for Basic Research, P O Box 1577,Palm Harbor, FL 34682,U S A ,\nibrrms@pinet aip",

    "A more comprehensive analysis is presented in memoir [9], which also includes the study\nof isodual theories of antimatter at the more general isotopic and isogravitational levels Ref Ref [9] also shows that know objections against antigravity are inapplicable to (and not\n“violated” by) the isodual theory of antimatter, because the former are (tacitly) constructed\non conventional mathematics, while the latter is formulated on a novel mathematics based\non a new negative unit After reviewing the mathematical foundations and the main predictions of the isodual\ntheory, in this note we identify a number of rather fundamental, open, theoretical and\nexperimental problems of the emerging “new physics of antimatter” ### 2 ISODUAL MATHEMATICS\n\n\nOur fundamental assumption is that of antimatter is that it is represented by the new isodual\nmathematics which is the anti-isomorphic image of conventional mathematics under map (1) 2\n\n\nSince the latter mathematics is still vastly unknown (in both mathematical and physical\ncircles), it appears recommendable to outline in this section the main notions in order to\nrender understandable the physical analysis of the next section An isodual field F [d] = F [d] (a [d], + [d], × [d] ) [2, 10, 11] is a ring whose elements are the isodual\nnumbers\na [d] = a [†] × 1 [d] = −a [†], (2)\n\n\n(where a represents real numbers n, complex numbers c or quaternions q, [†] represents Hermitean conjugation, 1 [d] = −1, and × represents the conventional multiplication) equipped\nwith: the isodual sum\na [d] 1 [+] [d] [ a] [d] 2 [=][ −][(][a] 1 [†] [+][ a] [†] 2 [)][,] (3)\n\n\nwith isodual additive unit 0 [d] ≡ 0, a [d] + [d] 0 [d] = 0 [d] + [d] a [d] ≡ a [d] ∀a [d] ∈ F [d] ; the isodual multiplication\n\n\na [d] 1 [×] [d] [ a] [d] 2 [=][ a] [d] 1 [×][ (][−][1)][ ×][ a] [d] 2 [=][ −][a] 1 [†] [×][ a] [†] 2 [,] (4)\n\n\nwith isodual multiplicative unit (or isodual unit for short) 1 [d] = −1, a [d] × [d] 1 [d] = 1 [d] × [d] a [d] ≡\na [d] ∀a [d] ∈ F [d] ; and remaining isodual operations, such as the isodual quotient\n\n\na [d] 3 [=][ a] [d] 1 [/] [d] [a] [d] 2 [=][ −][a] [d] 1 [/a] [d] 2 [=][ −][a] 1 [†] [/a] [†] 2 [,]\n\n\na [d] 3 [×] [d] [ a] [d] 2 [=][ a] [d] 1 [,] (5)\n\n\n\nthe isodual square root\n\n1\n(a [d] ) 2 [d] = � −a [d] = √\n\n\n\na [†],\n\n\n\n1 1\n(a [d] ) 2 [d] × [d] (a [d] ) 2 [d] = a [d], (6)\n\n\nand others [5, 10, 11] A property most important for this note is that the norm of isodual fields, called isodual\nnorm, is negative definite,\n\n\n1\n| a [d] | [d] =| a [d] | ×1 [d] = −| a [d] |= −(a × a [†] ) 2 (7)\n\n\nA quantity Q is called isoselfdual when it coincides with its isodual\n\n\nQ ≡ Q [d] = −Q [†] (8)\n\n\nFor instance, the imaginary quantity i = [√] −1 is isoselfdual because i [d] = −i [†] = −i =\n−(−i) ≡ i, where the upper symbol denotes complex conjugation Note that for real numbers n [d] = −n, and for complex number c [d] = (n 1 + i × n 2 ) [d] = n [d] 1 [+] [d]\n\n1\ni [d] × [d] n [d] 2 [=][ −][n] [1] [+][i][×][n] [2] [=][ −][c][ Note also that][ |][ n] [d] [ |] [d] [=][ −|][ n][ |][ and][ |][ c] [d] [ |] [d] [=][ −|][ c][ |][=][ −][(][n] [2] 1 [+][n] [2] 2 [)] 2",

while\n\n\n2) antimatter is represented by the isodual mathematics of the preceding section, including\nisodual numbers, isodual spaces, isodual algebras, etc, based on the isodual unit −1 The above representations of matter and antimatter are then interconnected by the isodual map (1) which is bi-injective and anti-isomorphic, as desired In this way, isoduality permits, apparently for the first time, a representation of antimatter at all levels, beginning at classical level and then continuing at levels of first and second\nquantization in which it becomes equivalent to charge conjugation [4, 9] By recalling that the isodual norm is negative definite, Eq (7), an important consequence is that all physical characteristics which are positive for matter become negative for\nantimatter The above occurrence is familiar with the charge q whose change of sign in\nthe transition from particles to antiparticles is re-interpreted as isoduality, q → q [d] = −q Jointly, however, isoduality requires that the mass of antiparticles is negative, m [d] = −m,\ntheir energy is negative, E [d] = −E, etc Finally, isoduality requires that antiparticles more\nbackward in time, t [d] = −t, as originated conceived [1] One should note that the conventional positive values for particles m > 0, E > 0, t > 0,\netc , are referred to corresponding positive units, while the negative values for antiparticles,\nm [d] < 0, E [d] < 0, t [d] < 0, etc , are referred to negative units of mass, energy, time, etc This\nimplies the full equivalence of the two representations and removes the traditional objections\nagainst negative physical characteristics In fact, isoduality removes the historical reason that forced Dirac to invent the “hole\ntheory” [1], which subsequently restricted the study of antimatter at the level of second\nquantization We are here referring to the fact that the negative energy solutions of Dirac’s\nequation behave unphysically when (tacitly) referred to positive units, but they behave in a\nfully physical way when referred to negative units [4, 9] The isodual theory of antimatter begins at the primitive Newtonian level so as to achieve\na complete equivalence of treatments with matter The basic carrier space is the isodual\n\nspace\nS [d] (t [d], r [d], v [d] ) = E [d] (t [d], R [d] ) × [d] E [d] (r [d], δ [d], R [d] ) × [d] E [d] (v [d], δ [d], R [d] ),\n\n\n7\n\n\nV [d] = d [d] r [d] / [d] d [d] t [d] = −V, (26)\n\n\nwith corresponding total 7-dimensional (dimensionless) unit\n\n\nI [d] = 1 [d] t [×] [d] [ I] r [d] [×] [d] [ I] v [d] [,]\n1 [d] t [=][ −][1][, I] r [d] = −Diag(1, 1, 1) = I v [d] [ ] (27)\n\n\nThe fundamental dynamical equations are the isodual Newton’s equations first introduced\nby the author in [11] m [d] x [d] d [d] v k [d] [/] [d] [d] [d] [t] [d] [ =][ F] k [ d] [(][t] [d] [, r] [d] [, v] [d] [)][, k][ =][ x, y, x, z ] (28)\n\n\nIt is easy to see that the above theory represents correctly all Newtonian Coulomb interactions In fact, the theory recovers the repulsive Coulomb force between two charges q 1\nand q 2 of equal sign of matter, F = k × q 1 × q 2 /r × r > 0;

Isodual symmetries realized via isodual unitary operators in H [d], e Isodual symmetries realized via isodual unitary operators in H [d], e g , Eq (26) (26) The fundamental notion of the theory is evidently given by the isodual Planck constant\nh¯ [d] = −h¯, although referred to a negative unit −1, thus being equivalent to ¯h > 0 when\nreferred to its positive unit +1 It is evident that the map from quantum mechanics to its isodual is bi–injective and\nanti-isomorphic, as desired and as occurring at all preceding levels Note in particular that the new Hilbert space invariance law (24) assures that all physical\nlaws which hold for particles also hold for antiparticles, as confirmed by the equivalence\nbetween charge conjugation and isoduality It should be noted that charge conjugation is (bi-injective and) homomorphic because\nspaces are mapped into themselves On the contrary, isoduality is (bi-injective and) antiisomorphic because spaces are mapped into new ones, the isodual spaces, which are coexistent, yet physically distinct from conventional spaces The latter occurrence will soon appear\ncrucial for the main results of this note Intriguingly, isodual quantum mechanics recovers the known electromagnetic and weak\nphemenology of antiparticles [5, 9], thus providing sufficient credibility for further studies In\n\n\n9\n\n\nfact, the isodual operator theory merely provides a re-interpretation of existing phenomenological knowledge, as the reader is encouraged to verify, e g , for the quantum Coulomb\ninteractions It should be also noted that the above results are reached for antiparticles in first quantization, because second quantization is done for exactly the same reasons used for particles, no\nmore and no less, owing to the complete parallelism of the theories for matter and antimatter\nat all levels Our relativistic theory of antimatter also begins at the classical level and it is based on a\nnew image of the special relativity called by this author the isodual special relativity [3, 5, 9] The latter theory is based on the isodual Minkowski space M [d] (x [d], η [d], R [d] ) with basic isodual\nunit of space and time (also in dimensional form) I [d] = −Diag(1, 1, 1, 1, ) The fundamental symmetry is the isodual Poincar´e symmetry P [d] (3 1) = L [d] (3 1) × [d] T [d]\n\n\n\n(3 1), with isodual Lorentz transforms\n\n x

confirming the isodual Lie theory [12] The applicability of the isodual special relativity for the characterization of antimatter\nis established by the isoselfduality of the relativistic

interested reader to see that the isodual special relativity recovers all known classical electromagnetic phenomenology for antiparticles [5, 9] The isodual theory of antimatter sees its best expression at the level of isodual relativistic\nquantum mechanics [5, 9], which is given by a simple isoduality of the conventional theory\nhere omitted for brevity We merely point out that negative units and related isodual theory appear in the very\nstructure of the conventional Dirac equation\n\n\nγ [µ] × [p µ − e × A µ (x)/c] + i × m × Ψ(x) = 0,\n\n\n\nI s 0\n� 0 −I s (37)\n�\n\n\n\n, γ [4] =

−σ [k] enter in the characterization of γ [k] 10\n\n\nThe above occurrence implies the emergence of a novel interpretation of the conventional\nDirac equation based on the following total unit, space and symmetry\n\n\nI Tot = {I orb × I spin } × {I orb [d] [×] [d] [ I] spin [d] [}][,]\n\nM Tot = {M(x, η, R) × S spin } × {M [d] (x [d], η [d], R [d] ) × [d] S spin [d] [}]\n\nS Tot = {SL(2 C) × T (3

    "1)}, (38)\n\n\nwhere I orb = Diag(1, 1, 1, 1) and I spin = Diag(1, 1) It should be indicated that the latter re-interpretation (which has also escaped attention thoughout this century) is necessary for consistency In fact, the conventional gamma\nmatrices (37) are isoselfdual The conventional interpretation that the Poincar´e symmetry\nP(3 1)= SL(2 C)×T (3 1) is the symmetry of Dirac’s equation then leads to inconsistencies\nbecause P(3 1) is not isoselfdual Only the product P(3 1)×P [d] (3 1) is isoselfdual The above results permit the following novel re-interpretation of Eq s (37)\n\n\nγ˜ [µ] × [p µ − e × A(x)/c] + i × m × Ψ( [˜] x) = 0,\n\n\n\n, ˜γ [4] = i\n�\n\n\n\nI s [d] 0\n� 0 I s\n\n\n\n,\n�\n\n\n\n˜\nγ k =\n\n\n\n0 σ k [d]\n� σ k 0\n\n\n\n(39)\n�\n\n\n\n{γ˜ µ, ˜γ ν } = 2η µν, ˜Ψ = −γ˜ 4 × Ψ = i ×\n\n\n\nΦ\nΦ [d]\n�\n\n\n\nwhere Φ(x) is now two-dimensional Note that the above equations: remove the need of second quantization; eliminate the\nneed of charge conjugation because the antiparticle is represented by σ [d], I [d], Φ [d] ; and restore the correct representation of spin 1/2 via the conventional two-dimensional regular\nrepresentation of SU(2), rather than the current use of a four-dimensional γ-representation We are now equipped to address the main objective of this note, a study of the antihydrogen atom and its spectroscopy For this purpose we restrict our analysis to massive particles defined as irreducible unitary\nrepresentations of the Poincar´e symmetry P(3 1)",
    "1) This essentially restricts the analysis to\nthe electron e and the proton p, both considered as elementary, due to certain ambiguities\nfor composite hadrons indicated in App A A We then introduce the notion of massive isodual particles as irreducible unitary representations of the isodual Poincar´e symmetry P [d] (3 1) This again restricts the analysis to the\nisodual electron e [d] and isodual proton p [d] At this point we should indicate the differences between “antiparticles” and “isodual particles” In first approximation, these two notions can be identified owing to the equivalence\nof charge conjugation and isoduality However, at a deeper inspection, antiparticles and\nisodual particles result to be different on a number of grounds, such as:\n\n\n1 Isoduality is broder than the PTC symmetry because, in addition to reversing spacetime coordinates x → x [d] = −x (PT) and conjugating the charge q → q [d] = −q (C), it\nalso reverses the sign of the background units Isoduality is broder than the PTC symmetry because, in addition to reversing spacetime coordinates x → x [d] = −x (PT) and conjugating the charge q → q [d] = −q (C), it\nalso reverses the sign of the background units 2 2 Antiparticles are defined in our own space-time, while isodual particles are defined in\na new space-time which is physically different than our own Antiparticles are defined in our own space-time, while isodual particles are defined in\na new space-time which is physically different than our own 11\n\n\n3",
    "11\n\n\n3 Antiparticles have positive mass, energy, (magnitude of) spin, etc , and move forward\nin time, while isodual particles have negative mass, energy, (magnitude of) spin, etc and move backward in time Next, we consider the bound states of the above elementary particles which are given\nby: the hydrogen atom A = (p, e) QM ; the isodual hydrogen atom A [d] = (p [d], e [d] ) IQM ; and the\npositronium P = (e, e [d] ) QM = (e [d], e) IQM, where QM (IQM) stands for Quantum Mechanics\n(Isodual Quantum Mechanics) It is evident that the hydrogen atom is characterized by the familiar Schr¨odinger’s equation in the Coulomb spectrum E n on the Hilbert space H,\n\n\nH× | Ψ >= E n × | Ψ > (40)\n\n\nThe isodual hydrogen atom is then characterized by the isodual image on H [d],\n\n\nH [d] × [d] | Ψ > [d] = E n [d] [×] [d] [ |][ Ψ] [d] [ ] (41)\n\n\nThe isodual theory therefore predicts that the isodual hydrogen atom has the same spectrum\nof the conventional atom, although with energy levels reversed in sign, E n [d] [=][ −][E] [n] [ ]\nThe positronium is an isoselfdual state, because evidently invariant under the interchanges e → e [d], e [d] → e As such, it possesses a positive spectrum E n in our space-time\nand a negative spectrum when studied in isodual space-time In fact, the total state of the\npositronium is given by | Pos > = | e > × | e > [d] with

information on electromagnetic (and weak) interactions of antiparticles No novelty is therefore expected along these\nlines in regard to the antihydrogen atom and the positronium However, the isodual theory has the following novel predictions for gravitational interactions [6, 9]:\n\n\nPREDICTION I: Massive stable isodual particles and their bound stated (such\nas the isodual hydrogen atom) experience antigravity in the field of matter and\nordinary gravity in the field of antimatter PREDICTION II: Bound states of massive stable particles and their isoduals\n(such as the positronium) experience ordinary gravity in both fields of matter and\nantimatter We now remain with the central open problem raised in this note: Does antimatter emit\na new light different than that emitted by ordinary matter 12\n\n\nThe answer provided by the isodual theory is in the affirmative Recall that the photon\nγ emitted by the hydrogen atom has positive energy and time according to the familiar\nplane-waves characterization on M(x, η, R) with unit I = Diag(1, 1, 1, 1)\n\n\nΨ(t, r) = A × e [i][×][(][k][×][r][−][E][×][t][)] (43)\n\n\nThe isodual hydrogen atom has negative energy and time As such, it is predicted to\nemit photons with the same characteristics, here called isodual photon and characterized by\nthe isoduality\n\n\nΨ [d] (t [d], r [d] ) = A [d] × [d] e [di] [d] [×] [d] [(][k] [d] [×] [d] [r] [d] [−][E] [d] [×] [d] [t] [d] [)] =\n\n= A × e [−][i][×][(][k][×][r] [d] [−][E][×][t] [d] [)], (44)\n\n\n\nnow defined on M [d] (x [d], η [d], R [d] ) with isodual unit I [d] = −Diag(1, 1, 1, 1) It is easy to see that the isodual photon is characterized by the isodual special relativity\nvia the spin 1 [d] = −1, massless, irreducible, isodual unitary representation of P [d] (3 1), the\n\nd 1\n\nisodual neutrinos being the corresponding representation for spin 2 [1] = − 2 [ ]\n\nIt should be recalled again that the isodual particle γ [d] behaves exactly like the ordinary\nphoton γ under all electromagnetic and weak interactions Moreover, massive particles and\ntheir isoduals do annihilate into photons, but photons and their isoduals cannot annihilate The sole known possibility to distinguish photons from their isoduals is via gravitational\ninteractions We reach in this way the following:\n\n\nPREDICTION III: The isodual photon experiences antigravity in the field of matter and gravity in the field of antimatter If confirmed by future theoretical and experimental studies, the above prediction would\npermit to ascertain whether a far away galaxy or quasar is made up of matter or antimatter\nby measuring whether its light is attracted or repelled by the gravitational field of matter In principle, the above hypothesis can be experimentally tested in contemporary astrophysics, provided that care is exercised in the interpretation of the results In fact, the\ngravitational attraction of light emitted from a very distant galaxy by a closer galaxy is\nnot evidence that they are made up of matter, because both galaxies can be made-up of\nantimatter However, the astrophysical measure of gravitational repulsion of light under the above\nconditions would be an experimental confirmation of our isodual theory of antimatter, although we would not be in a position of identifying which of the two galaxies is made-up of\nmatter and which is made up of antimatter The resolution of the latter issues will be possible when the technology on the gravitational deflection of light permits the measure of light deflected by fields we are sure to be\nmade-up of matter, such as a near-by planet or the Sun It should be indicated that the deflection of light originating from far away galaxies or\nquasars has indeed been measured and in all cases it has shown to be attracted by matter Therefore, no light repelled by matter (or isodual light) has been detected until now to our\nbest knowledge 13\n\n\nIn summary, the “new physics of antimatter” will remain unsettled until we have final\nexperimental results on the behavior in the gravitational field of matter of: isodual photons,\nisodual electrons (positions), isodual proton (antiproton), positronium, and isodual (anti)\nhydrogen atom Note that the availability of several of the above experimental resolutions, but not that\nfor the positronium will still leave the theory of antimatter essentially unsettled because of\nthe several conceivable alternatives which remain possible In closing we should point out that, by no means, all possible open questions related to\nthe new isodual theory of antimatter can be resolved in this introductory note Among a virtually endless number of aspects to be studied, we mention the need for the\nisodual re-interpretation of second quantization which can be achieved via the separation of\nretarded and advanced solutions as belonging to the Minkowski space and its isodual, respectively, and the re-interpretation of the former (latter) as characterizing particles (isodual\nparticles) Preliminary (unpublished) studies have indicated that the above re-interpretation essentially leaves unchanged the numerical results for electromagnetic and weak interactions all\nthe way to the isodual re-interpretation of Feynman diagrams, although this expectation\nmust evidently be confirmed by specific studies However, the re-interpretation implies significant changes, e g",
    "g , the study whether a given\nphoton is indeed such or it is an isodual photon As an example, the isodual interpretation\nof the two-photon decay of the positronium requires the re-formulation\n\n\nPos = (e, e [d] ) IQM → γ + γ [d] (45)\n\n\nA similar result is expected for other decays, e g , π [0] → γ+γ [d] under the condition that the\nπ [0] is also a bound state of a particle its antiparticle We should recall that no conservation\nlaw of matter and, independently, of antimatter, is possible because of their interconnection\nvia finite transition probabilities established beginning with Dirac’s equation Therefore,\nthe isodual theory also admits the three-body decays of the positronium into γ + γ + γ [d] or\nγ + γ [d] + γ [d], e g , when the total energy of the two γ’s (of the two γ [d] ’s) of the three-body\ndecay is equal to the energy of the γ (of the γ [d] ) of the two-body decay Along similar lines, under sufficient amounts of energy, particle-antiparticle systems can\nalso decay for the isodual theory into one single photon or one single isodual photon Similar\nsituations permitted by the lack of conservation of matter and, separately, of antimatter,\nalso occur for the decay of pions and in other interactions Note that there is no new law of conservation of matter and, separately, of antimatter,\nbecause of the finite transition probability among them established beginning with Dirac’s\nequation The only possible conservation laws are the conventional ones is our space time\nand, separately,their isoduals for antimatter In addition to the isodual studies in second quantization, it is necessary to conduct\nfurther studies on the interior gravitational problem of matter and of antimatter via the\nisotopic methods [5, 9] In fact the latter studies have provided the strongest avaible evidence on the existence of\nantigravity originating from the identification (rather than the “unification”) of the (exterior)\ngravitational field with the electromagnetic field originating the mass considered [13] It is\nevident that such identification implies the equivalence of the two phenomenologies, that is,\n\n\n14\n\n\ngravitation is expected to have both attraction and repulsion in the same way as occurring\nfor electromagnetism The above argument is so forceful that the experimental establishment of the lack of existence of antigravity may ultimately imply the need to re-write particle physics, beginning\nwith the electron, into a form in which the mass does not possess an appreciable electromagnetic origin, or it may imply the lack of physical validity of the mathematical notion of\nisoduality Finally, additional studies are needed on the classical and quantum isotopic representation of gravity and its isodual [9], because these studies contain all the preceding ones plus\nthe inclusion of gravitation which is embedded in the unit for matter and in the isodual unit\nfor antimatter Preliminary (unpublished) studies have indicated that the latter approach confirm the\nresults of this note, while permitting further advances at the isooperator gravitational level,\ne g , an axiomatically consistent formulation of the PTC theorem inclusive of gravitation We finally note that the possible lack of existence of antigravity for the isudual photon will\nnot invalidate the isodual theory, because it will only imply the isoselfduality of the photon,\nthat is, presence in the photon of both retarded and advanced solutions, which would remain\nseparated for massive particles Thus, antigravity may exists for massive particles without\nnecessarily existing for light Interested readers are encouraged to identify possible theoretical arguments against antigravity for light emitted by antimatter, with the clear understanding that the final scientific\nresolution one way or the other can only be the experimental one ### APPENDIX A: Gravitational problematic aspects of quark theories The “new physics of antimatter” is expected to have an impact on all of elementary\nparticle physics, because it focuses the attention on novel gravitational, rather than familiar\nelectroweak aspects An illustration is given by a necessary reformulation of contemporary quark theories In\nfact, gravitation is solely defined in our space-time, while quarks are solely defined in the\nmathematical, unitary, internal space, with no interconnection being possible due to the\nO’Rafeirtaigh theorem It necessarily follows that all particles made-up of quarks cannot have any gravitation at\nall, which is grossly contrary to experimental evidence It should be indicated that O’Raifeartaigh’s theorem has been superseded by graded Lie\nalgebras and related supersymmetries, in which case a connection between space-time and\ninternal symmetries is possible However, the validity of such interconnection would require\nthe prior establishment of the physical validity of supersymmetries and the existence of their\n\n\n15\n\n\npredicted new particles Irrespective of that, a correct formulation of the gravity of quarks\nwithin this latter setting is faced with serious technical problems and it has not been achieved\nuntil now, to our best knowledge The above conclusion is confirmed by the well known fact that quarks cannot be characterized by irreducible representations of the Poincar´e group, that is, quark masses do not\nexist in our space-time, and are mere parameters in unitary spaces Even assuming that the above fundamental problem is somewhat resolved via hitherto\nunknown manipulations, additional equally fundamental problems exist in the construction\nof a quark theory of antimatter, because it does not yield in general an anti-isomorphic image\nof the phenomenology of matter When including the additional, well known problematic aspects of quark theories (e g ,\nthe vexing problem of confinement which is not permitted by the uncertainty principle), a\nstructural revision of contemporary quark theories becomes beyond credible doubts The only resolution of the current scientific impass known to this author is that advocated\nsince 1981, quarks cannot be elementary particles [14], as apparently confirmed by recent\nexperiments at Fermi-lab [15] In fact, the compositeness of quarks would permit their construction as suitable bound\nstates of physical massive particles existing in our space-time, in which case (only) there\nwould be the regaining of the physical behavior under gravity The following aspects should however be clearly stated to separate science from fiction First, the above new generation of quark theories requires the abandonment of the conventional Poincar´e symmetry P (3 1) in favor of
