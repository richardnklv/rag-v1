    ", 1972) Recognition of the significance\nand role of ZMP in biped artificial walk was a turning\npoint in gait planning and control In the gait synthesis by semi-inverse method\n(Vukobratović M & Juričić D 1968, Vukobratović M &\nJuričić D 1969, Vukobratović M & Stepanen-ko Yu ,\n1972) legs trajectories are predefined while the trunk\nmotion is determined so as to ensure dynamic\nequilibrium of the system as a whole (the ZMP position\nis within the desired area under the supporting foot) Such motion is called nominal motion In contemporary practice, the aim is to have the\npossibility of synthesizing all gait patterns (under a gait\npattern we understand each gait with specifically defined\nparameters), and each synthesized gait is called nominal However, such approach requires the synthesis of a huge\n\n\n99\n\n\nnumber of different patterns, and a question arises\nwhether one can envisage all possible cases that may be\nof interest, so that for each situation a most suitable one\ncould be selected and executed In addition, during the\ngait realization, a situation can often arise when small\nmodifications of the basic regime are needed to adapt to\nthe momentary requirements imposed on the locomotion\nsystem We believe that, at least in some basic cases, it is\nnot necessary to perform a new nominal synthesis but is\npossible to do on-line modification of an existing\nnominal (Vukobratović _et al _ 2003, (Vukobratović _et al _\n2004) **2 **2 Mechanism structure and its nominal motion**\n\nOur idea was tested on the example of a locomotion\nmechanism (Fig 1) having 20 DOFs, with all joints\nbeing rotational (Vukobratović _et al _ 1990) Between two\njoints is placed one link A joint having more DOFs is\nmodeled as a set of simple rotational joints, each having\nonly one DOF In the case of a multi-DOF joint modeling\nthe links between single-DOF joints are considered as\nbeing of zero length, mass and moments of inertia",
    "In the case of a multi-DOF joint modeling\nthe links between single-DOF joints are considered as\nbeing of zero length, mass and moments of inertia In\nFig 1, these \"fictitious\" links are denoted by dashed line\n(for example link 3 at the ankle joint, links 6 and 7 at the\nhip joint of the right leg, etc ) Accordingly, the ankle\njoint having 2 DOFs is represented by joints 3 and 4 (the\njoint axes are defined by the orts _**e**_ _**3**_ and _**e**_ _**4**_ ), hip joint of\nthe right leg by joints 6, 7 and 8, trunk joint (waist) by\njoints 15 and 16 All other joints are modeled by simple\nrotational joints having one DOF Fig 1 ** 1 ** ** Scheme of locomotion mechanism\n\n\n100\n\n\n\nThe possibility of the mechanism's overturning about the\nfoot edge is modeled by two \"fictitious\" joints in the\ndirections of the axes _x_ and _y_ to detect if the mechanism\nas a whole will rotate in the _y-z_ or _x-z_ plane Each\nmechanism joint is powered by a DC motor except for\njoints 1 and 2 under the foot representing unpowered\nDOFs All parameters of the mechanism can be found in\n\n[4] The mechanism motion is synthesized using semiinverse method in such a way that dynamic equilibrium\nis permanently ensured during the walk (Vukobratović _et_\n_al _ 1990) Legs motion pattern was obtained by recording\nthe performance of a human subject, and then, the trunk\nmotion was synthesized in such a way to ensure that\nground reaction force under the foot is in a certain\npredefined position (in our example this is the point O of\nthe coordinate system _O_ _xyz_ ), ensuring simultaneously that\nhorizontal components of the ground reaction moment\nare equal to zero, i e _**M**_ _**x**_ = _**M**_ _**y**_ =0 As already said, this\npoint is known as ZMP Each change of the dynamics\nabove the supporting foot causes displacement of the\nZMP out of its nominal position Walk synthesis has been\ncarried out for one half-step of single-support phase only The mechanism walks in such a way that while one leg is\nin support phase the other one is transferred from the\nback to front position When it reaches the position just\nabove the ground floor the support foot is changed and\nthe walk continues Footprints of themechanism nominal\nmotion (ZMP nominal positions) are presented in Fig 2 Path width [m]\n\n\n0 3\n\n\n0 2\n\n\n0 1\n\n\n0\n\n\n-0 1\n0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1\n\n\nWalking direction [m]\n\nFig 2",
    "2 Mechanism footprints and ZMP position during\nnominal motion\n\nIf during the walk the ZMP position comes out of the\nsupport polygon, this means that the mechanism is not\nperforming dynamically balanced gait any more, and it\ncollapses by rotating about the foot edge ZMP position,\nbeing very sensitive to the changes of dynamics of the\nmechanism above the foot, is the best overall indicator of\nthe mechanism dynamic equi-librium In Fig 3 is shown\na stick diagram of the mechanism performing nominal\nmotion **3 Modification of the nominal motion**\n\n_3 1_ _Turning_\nThe nominal motion modification to be considered first\nis the change of walk direction Namely, very often there\n\n\nis a need to switch from a rectilinear motion to the\nright/left direction without interrupting the walk, so that\nit would be highly desirable to achieve such a gait by\nmodifying nominal rectilinear motion Namely, very often there\n\n\nis a need to switch from a rectilinear motion to the\nright/left direction without interrupting the walk, so that\nit would be highly desirable to achieve such a gait by\nmodifying nominal rectilinear motion Fig 3 Stick diagram of the mechanism performing\nnominal motion\n\nFirst thing to be considered is how to perform turning The angle α formed between the foot at the end of a\nsingle-support phase and the foot that up to that moment\nwas in contact with the ground will be adopted as the\nmeasure of the extent of turning A smaller α corresponds to a “milder” and a larger to a\n“sharper” turning Besides, care should be exercised as to\nthe relative position of the mechanism’s feet (legs) with\nrespect to the “body” In the case of the mechanism used\n(see Fig 2) the turning will be realized by rotation at\njoints 7 and 10, so that both joints are activated\nsimultaneously A simplest algorithm would be to perform turning so that\nin each half-step the leg being in the swing phase rotates\nso that the foot that is making contact with the ground\nforms an angle α with respect to the foot that was\npreviously in contact with the ground However, this\nalgorithm did not perform well since the “outer” and\n“inner” leg followed arcs of different lengths so that soon\narose the situation in which the motion could not be\ncontinued at all A solution to this problem would be to\nperform deflection in the first half-step, and in the\nsecond correction of the deviation due to the foot\nrotation, so that in the beginning of the next step the feet\n\n\n\nare not deflected with respect to the trunk The next thing to be considered is the way in which foot\nturning by the angle α will be realized – whether once or\nincrementally in the course of the whole half-step, so that\nat the end the foot deflects by the full value of the angle\nα In the present work we chose gradual increase of the\nturning angle Let the desired value of foot deflection at the end of a\n\nhalf-step be defined by the angle α If the number of\nintegration intervals during a half-step is n int the value of\ndeflection angle to be realized in one integration interval\nis ∆ α = α _**n**_ int This value is halved and the value\n\n( ∆α 2 ) is added to each of joints 7 and 10 Let us\n\nexplain this on the example of turning to the left, as\nshown in Fig",
