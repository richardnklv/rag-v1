    "## Characterising a Si(Li) detector element for the SIXA X-ray spectrometer\n\n### T Tikkanen\n\nObservatory and Astrophysics Laboratory, P O Box 14 (T¨ahtitorninm¨aki),\nFIN-00014 University of Helsinki, Finland\n\n### S Kraft, F Scholze, R Thornagel, G Ulm\n\n\nPhysikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Abbestr 2–12, D-10587 Berlin, Germany\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe detection efficiency and response function of a Si(Li) detector element for the\nSIXA spectrometer have been determined in the 500 eV to 5 keV energy range\nusing synchrotron radiation emitted at a bending magnet of the electron storage\nring BESSY, which is a primary radiation standard The agreement between the\nmeasured spectrum and the model calculation is better than 2% The agreement between the\nmeasured spectrum and the model calculation is better than 2% PACS: 95 55 Ka; 07 85 Nc; 29 40 Wk; 85 30 De\n\n\nKey words: Si(Li) detectors, X-ray spectrometers, detector calibration, X-ray\nresponse, spectral lineshape\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\n\nThe SIXA (Silicon X-Ray Array) spectrometer [1] is a focal plane instrument\nof the SODART X-ray telescope on board the Russian Spectrum-X-Gamma\nsatellite scheduled for launch in 1998 SIXA is a closely packed array of 19\ndiscrete Si(Li) detector elements which collect X-rays in the energy range\nbetween 500 eV and 20 keV with an energy resolution of 200 eV at 6 keV The detector crystals are kept at a temperature of about 120 K by a passive\ncooling system Although simple calibration methods involving a set of discrete X-ray lines\nfrom radioactive sources may be adequate for many applications of Si(Li)\ndetectors, this is not the case in X-ray astronomy where one often wants to\nresolve emission or absorption line features superposed on a continuum Fine\n\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 23 August 2018\n\n\nstructures in the instrumental response associated with absorption edges of\nthe constituent elements of the instrument can mimic such line features, and\nthese spurious lines may coincide with real lines from astronomical sources Modern instruments combining high throughput X-ray optics with detectors\nof high resolving power have proved to be able to resolve such fine effects: for\nexample, the spectrum of the Crab Nebula (which normally has no features)\nhad a hump at the L absorption edge of xenon when observed by the xenonfilled GSPC’s on board the Japanese Tenma satellite [2] and line features near\nthe K edges of silicon, aluminium and oxygen when observed by NASA’s Broad\nBand X-Ray Telescope which contained these elements in its segmented Si(Li)\ndetector and entrance window [3,4] Synchrotron radiation (SR) is needed to resolve X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) or to obtain accurate characterisation in the photon energy range\nbelow 5 keV where other appropriate X-ray sources are not available Soft Xray transmission of the entrance window of SIXA was measured using SR [5] XAFS of the detector surface has been measured recently and is to be published in a future paper Simulations suggested that the effect of the entrance\nsurface on the detection process in Si(Li) detectors, as modelled by Scholze\nand Ulm [6], is of particular importance for SIXA in the range below 3 keV In\nthis paper we report the characterisation of a SIXA detector element carried\nout following their procedure, which resulted in the experimental determination of the detector response and the detection efficiency Another goal of\nthis experiment was to investigate a temperature dependent low-energy tailing\nphenomenon reported by the manufacturer (Metorex International Oy, Espoo,\nFinland) 2 Detector model\n\n\n2 1 Detector design\n\n\nThe detector elements fabricated for SIXA are top-hat Si(Li) detectors which\nare 3 5 mm thick and have an active diameter of 9 2 mm (see Fig 1)",
    "1) Xrays enter through a contact layer of Au/Pd alloy whose nominal thickness\nis 30 nm with a mass composition of 60% Au and 40% Pd The anode side\nof the crystal has a smaller diameter to reduce the readout capacitance, thus\nyielding a better energy resolution The diameter is greater on the cathode side\nwhere the drifted region is encircled by uncompensated p-type silicon which\nhas been left there to facilitate the handling of the crystal The edge is coated\nwith polyimide to provide passivation The edge is coated\nwith polyimide to provide passivation 2\n\n\n2 2 X-ray response\n\n\nThe X-ray response of the SIXA elements was modelled according to ref [6]\nwhere a detailed description of the detector model is given, so that here only\na summary of the basic concepts of the model is presented The main feature of the model is that no inactive layer of silicon is assumed; instead, the\n”window effect” is explained by a strong expansion of the charge cloud before\nthermalisation and consequent escape of electrons into the contact material A photon impinging on the detector can either be transmitted or absorbed in\nthe detector crystal, the contact material or possible contamination layers such\nas carbon and oxygen Absorption in the contact layer produces photo- and\nAuger electrons and fluorescence photons which can be lost without being\ndetected or, with a calculable probability, enter the crystal Every photon\nabsorbed in the crystal and every electron entering the crystal produces a cloud\nof electron–hole pairs in the Si(Li) crystal The charge carriers are thermalised\nand start to drift in the electric field set up in the detector, which produces\na charge signal on the electrodes The detection efficiency is defined as a\ntotal detection efficiency ǫ(E) which includes all pulses produced by photons\nabsorbed in the detector The total detection efficiency ǫ(E) of a SIXA crystal is equal to the absorptance of the active region times the transmittance of the Au/Pd contact and\nthe contamination layers plus the probability P Au/Pd (E) that an incident photon absorbed in the Au/Pd alloy will produce a pulse:\n\n\nǫ(E) = (1 − τ Si )τ Au/Pd τ C τ ice + P Au/Pd (1)\n\n\nAs indicated above, the latter contribution originates from absorption events\nwhere a photo- or Auger electron or a fluorescence photon is generated in the\ncontact layer and emitted into the crystal Unlike the full-peak detection efficiency, which includes only the Gaussian part of the peak, ǫ(E) is independent\nof the attenuation coefficient of silicon at low energies The pulse height distribution C(E) measured with the detector exposed to\nthe spectral photon flux Φ E (E) is given by\n\n\nC(E) = R(E [′], E)ǫ(E [′] )Φ E (E [′] ) dE [′] (2)\n�\n\n\nKnowledge of the normalised response function R(E [′], E) and the photon flux\nΦ E (E) facilitates the determination of ǫ(E) from the measured pulse height\ndistribution C(E)",
    "(2)\n�\n\n\nKnowledge of the normalised response function R(E [′], E) and the photon flux\nΦ E (E) facilitates the determination of ǫ(E) from the measured pulse height\ndistribution C(E) 3\n\n\n2 3 Simulation\n\n\nThe influence of the detector model on the analysis of astronomical data acquired by SIXA was investigated by simulating an observation of a typical astronomical target by SIXA, following the procedure described in ref [5] where\nit was applied to XAFS in the entrance window The same power-law spectrum modified by interstellar absorption (simulating the Crab Nebula) was\nfolded through the combined instrumental response of SIXA and SODART\nto compute the simulated data The data were then modelled in a traditional\nway assuming a dead layer of silicon to explain the window effect; the response\nfunction in this model consisted simply of two Gaussian peaks, the full-energy\npeak and the escape peak The result is presented in Fig 2 2 The dead layer\nthickness was 160 nm which would have been the result of a measurement\nwith a [55] Fe source Although the dead layer model can reproduce the data very well at higher\nenergies, it introduces spurious structures at the K edge of silicon and at the\nM edges of gold, and below 1 keV the models are completely in disaccord The\nresult indicates clearly that if full scientific return at low energies is required,\nthe detector response has to be accurately determined using an appropriate\nmodel with parameters abstracted from SR calibration data 3 Experiment\n\n\nThe SR measurements were performed at the PTB radiometry laboratory at\nthe electron storage ring BESSY The SX700 plane grating monochromator\nof the PTB radiometry laboratory [7] was utilized to measure the response\nfunction in the 0",
    "The SX700 plane grating monochromator\nof the PTB radiometry laboratory [7] was utilized to measure the response\nfunction in the 0 6 keV to 1 5 keV photon energy range and the double crystal\nmonochromator KMC of BESSY [8] was used in the 1 8 keV to 5 9 keV energy\nrange The measurements with undispersed SR were carried out at a specially\ndesigned beamline of the PTB radiometry laboratory The photon flux of\nundispersed SR emitted at a bending magnet of the electron storage ring\nBESSY is calculable with an uncertainty well below 0 5% in the desired energy\nrange [9–11] The accuracy of the calibration is mainly limited by the ability\nto extract the thicknesses of the contact and contamination layers Because of\nthe moderate resolution of the detector, fine structures cannot be recovered The SIXA flight assembly was being assembled during the measurement shift\nat BESSY and therefore the characterisation had to be done using one of\nthree available crystals which were left over after the selection of the best\ncrystals for the flight model The three crystals were studied at Metorex using\nan electron microscope in order to select the best representative of a typical\n\n\n4\n\n\nflight model crystal with respect to the temperature dependent tailing effect Many crystals appeared to have a critical temperature (which usually fell near\nthe expected in-orbit operation temperature) where the low-energy tail started\nto grow rapidly with temperature One of the three crystals did not exhibit\nthis effect even at 170 K, while another one was found to have suffered from\nshelf storage The third one was suitable: the tail between the main peak and\nthe escape peak became about two times higher when the temperature was\nraised from 125 K to 130 K This crystal was chosen to be characterised with\nSR and to serve as transfer standard detector for calibration of the other SIXA\n\ncrystals 4 Measurement and modelling of the response function\n\n\n4 1 Homogeneity\n\n\nThe detector homogeneity was tested by positioning the beam at five different\nlocations on the crystal (cf Fig 1) At the position ’0 mm’ the beam was\nlocated at the edge of the active region so that half of the total intensity was\ndetected As can be seen in Fig 3 the response function was very similar at the\nthree central positions, while the tail is much higher at the ’0 mm’ position At the ’8 2 mm’ position near the opposite edge, a slight increase of the tailing\nis observable The temperature was 124 K and the beam width about 1 mm The temperature dependence was studied with the beam positioned at the\ncentre No change in the tail structure was seen up to the temperature of\n132 K, although noise and the FWHM increased as expected (see Fig 4)",
    "4) These results suggest that the previously observed growth of the tailing between 125 and 130 K, which was measured using an isotropic source and an\naperture diameter of 9 2 mm, occurs only at the periphery of the detector Top-hat detectors typically suffer from tailing in peripheral regions where the\nsignal electrons drift towards the side surface rather than the anode because\nan n-type channel is formed on the surface [12] Despite their polyimide passivation, SIXA crystals are obviously subject to this effect as well Leakage\ncurrent is generated on the same surface and the leakage currents were found\nto be as high in polyimide coated crystals as in uncoated crystals [13] The\nsensitivity of the surface potential to ambient conditions provides an obvious\nexplanation for the observed temperature dependence of the tailing This is\nillustrated in Fig 5 which depicts the detector at two different temperatures The potential profiles were computed by the two-dimensional modelling program SCORPIO [14] with different effective doping densities of the surface\nchannel Photon absorptions at the periphery yield defective pulses because\nelectron clouds generated at greater radial distances drift to the side surface\n\n\n5\n\n\nwhere electrons can be trapped Tailing is more pronounced in the situation of\nthe lower plot where the effective doping is higher, corresponding to a higher\ntemperature The result of the homogeneity test can be understood with the\nupper plot The ’0 mm’ position was at a radial distance of about 4 6 mm Electron paths starting around this distance end at the side surface, thus\nexplaining the tail On the other hand, electrons from around 3 6 mm head\ntowards the back surface outside the anode, producing pulses with almost full\nenergy which cause the small broadening of the left side of the peak at the\n’8 2 mm’ position The tail feature further from the peak is caused by the part\nof the beam extending closer to the edge",
    "The tail feature further from the peak is caused by the part\nof the beam extending closer to the edge 4 2 Response function\n\n\nThe measured response functions were fitted by using the HYPERMET function in the form of [6] including a Gaussian peak, an escape peak, an exponential tail and a flat shelf The total function includes ten energy dependent\nparameters The shelf contribution is attributed to the escape probabilities\nof primary electrons to and from the contact layer (Au/Pd alloy) The calculated and fitted shelf contribution can be seen in Fig 6; the calculation\nincludes the most probable Auger and photoelectron energies The short tail\nis caused by the escape of hot electrons into the contact layer The short tail\nis caused by the escape of hot electrons into the contact layer Fig 7 shows\nthis contribution as a function of energy and a fit with R = 210 nm, where\nR is the radius of the spherical electron cloud It can be seen that below\n1 8 keV the difference to the fitted tail contribution increases with decreasing\nenergy The measurement in this energy region was taken at the plane grating\nmonochromator, where more stray light exists at energies above 1 keV resulting in higher tailing contributions At lower energies the peak cannot properly\nbe extracted from the noise leading to fits with lower tail contributions These\ndifficulties demonstrate the necessity of a theoretical model which allows an\nextrapolation of the fit parameters to lower energies Using these parameters the response function in the 500 eV to 4 keV range can\nbe constructed for the central region",
    "Using these parameters the response function in the 500 eV to 4 keV range can\nbe constructed for the central region Fig 8 shows a comparison of some typical\nmeasured distributions and the corresponding theoretical curves described by\nthe response function The inhomogeneity of the response should be taken into\naccount, because the aperture diameter in the flight model array will be about\n9 mm and thus the excess tailing can affect a great part of the active area Excluding the peripheral region by additional collimation is to be avoided as it\nwould diminish the effective area At 124 K about 10% of the area seems to be\naffected in the present case, but Fig 5 suggests that the affected area can be 2\nor 3 times larger at depths of 1–2 mm where more energetic photons would be\nabsorbed The affected region can be expected to grow with the temperature,\nand the region will have a different size for each Si(Li) crystal 6\n\n\n5 Calibration with undispersed synchrotron radiation\n\n\nFor the measurements with undispersed SR the number of stored electrons\nwas decreased to either 5 or 2 electrons, yielding respectively about 3600 and\n1500 photons per second striking the detector The flux through an aperture\nwith an area of 27 8(2) mm [2] at a distance of 15783(3) mm from the source\npoint was calculated from the known electron storage ring parameters [9] in\nthe energy range 100 eV to 5 keV The measured spectra were compared to the\nmodel calculations of Eq",
    "The measured spectra were compared to the\nmodel calculations of Eq (2) (2) The determined response function of the central\narea is valid for this measurement because the aperture was small enough and\nthe coldfinger temperature was 125 K A proper comparison of the measured spectra and the predicted spectra requires an energy calibration of the multichannel analyser with an uncertainty\nof about 0 A proper comparison of the measured spectra and the predicted spectra requires an energy calibration of the multichannel analyser with an uncertainty\nof about 0 1% 1% For the energy calibration the line position at 900 eV was determined by the Gaussian peak position of the best fit of the response function The SX700 energy scale is more accurate than 0 5 eV at this point At 6 4 keV\nthe Fe K α emission line(s) of a [55] Co source was used for the calibration A\nlinear gain was assumed A\nlinear gain was assumed A considerable pile-up contribution in the spectra measured with 2 and 5 electrons in the electron storage ring was observed The pile-up rate or coincidence\nprobability of two pulses with the count rates N(E 1 ) and N(E 2 ) occuring in\nthe interval T R is equal to the product [15],\n\n\nN P (E 1 + E 2 ) = N(E 1 )N(E 2 )T R, (3)\n\n\nif T R N(E) ≪ 1 The resolving time T R is in first approximation a constant The pile-up contribution N P (E) of the whole spectrum can be extracted via\nthe calculation of the auto-correlation function of the calculated spectrum\n\n[16,17]:\n\n\n\nN P (E) ∼\n\n\n\n∞\n\n\nC(E [′] )C(E − E [′] ) dE [′] (4)\n\n�\n\n0\n\n\n\nTwo photons impinging within the time interval T R cannot be resolved by\nthe electronics and appear as one pile-up pulse From the difference of the\nspectra taken with 2 and 5 electrons in the electron storage ring T R can be\ndetermined in the way that with the appropriate T R both spectra coincide after\na pile-up correction T R can be used as a proportionality constant for Eq (4) The doubled number of calculated pile-up pulses N P have to be subtracted\n\n\n7\n\n\nafterwards, so that the pile-up corrected spectrum C [′] (E) is\n\n\n\nC [′] (E) = C(E) 1 − 2 [N] [P]\n� N\n\n\n\n+ N P (E) (5)\n�\n\n\n\nApplying this formula to the present spectra results in a constant relative\ndeviation of 3% for the 2 electron spectrum and of about 10% for the 5 electron\nspectrum",
    "(5)\n�\n\n\n\nApplying this formula to the present spectra results in a constant relative\ndeviation of 3% for the 2 electron spectrum and of about 10% for the 5 electron\nspectrum An explanation of the result might be that in the real detection\nprocess the deadtime is overestimated An influence of low energy pulses which\nare part of the calculation but cannot be seen by the electronics might also\nbe possible The deadtime of the measurements was 11% and 23% with 2\nand 5 electrons respectively To account for a realistic pile-up distribution, the\nnumerical calculated pile-up pulses are not only distributed in the sum energy\ncorresponding channel, but also in all channels between both contributing\npulses This has been taken into account for the present calculations In order\nto obtain two coincident spectra the factor 2 in Eq (5) has to be replaced by\n√2 Fig 9 shows the comparison of the measured and calculated spectra A\n\nresolving time of 25 µs has been used in order to fit the measurements If the pile-up rejection works, the deadtime and the pile-up influence is neglectable for a typical photon flux of a few hundred per second The excellent\nagreement within the statistical uncertainty in the energy range 500 eV to\n4 keV for both the low count rate spectrum and the high count rate spectrum\nconfirms the correctness of the calculation in this particular case The lowest\ndeviation is found with thicknesses of 20 1(3) nm and 20 1(3) nm for Au and\nPd, respectively, and an ice layer of 16(3) nm This is equivalent to a contact\nlayer thickness of 40 7 nm and nearly consistent with the mass ratio of 60:40\nof the elements Au and Pd A possible carbon layer can be neglected The\ndetection efficiency calculated with the determined parameters from Eq (1)\nas well as the full-peak efficiency are shown in Fig 10",
    "10 The uncertainty reflects\nthe thickness determination of the Au, Pd and ice layers and the shelf The\naccuracy of the total photon flux is limited by the knowledge of the detector\naperture size It should be mentioned that the uncertainties are determined\non the basis of results obtained with different models of pile-up calculations\nand would have been lower without any pile-up effect 6 Conclusion\n\n\nWith the aid of dispersed and undispersed SR, the response function and\nthe detection efficiency in the central region of a Si(Li) crystal for the SIXA\nspectrometer in the soft X-ray range have been determined The agreement\nbetween the calculated and the measured spectra within 2% is a further confirmation of the correctness of the physical detector model The detection\n\n\n8\n\n\nefficiency has been determined with an uncertainty below 1 5% above 1 keV Although excellent results have been obtained after a pile-up correction, a\nrepetition of the measurement with undispersed SR is recommended, because\nthe characterised detector element will be taken as a transfer standard for the\ncalibration of the SIXA flight assembly The previously observed temperature dependence was found to arise from the\ninhomogeneity of the response near the edge of the cylindrical crystal This\neffect is presumed to cover a large part of the detector area and requires\ntherefore further study Acknowledgements\n\n\nWe thank M Jantunen of Metorex for information about the crystals and the\ntest results References\n\n\n[1] O Vilhu, J Huovelin, T Tikkanen, P Hakala, P Muhli, V J K¨am¨ar¨ainen, H Sipil¨a, I Taylor, J Pohjonen, H P¨aivike, J Toivanen, R Sunyaev, A Kuznetsov\nand A Abrosimov, Proc SPIE 2279 (1994) 532 [2] K Koyama, T Ikegami, H Inoue, N Kawai, K Makishima, M Matsuoka, K Mitsuda, T Murakami, Y Ogawara, T Ohashi, K Suzuki, Y Tanaka, I Waki\nand E E Fenimore, Publ Astron Soc Japan 36 (1984) 659 [3] K A Weaver, Legacy - The Journal of the HEASARC, Nr 5 (1994) 12 [4] P J Serlemitsos, F E Marshall, R Petre, K Jahoda, E A Boldt, S S Holt,\nR Mushotzky, J Swank, A Szymkowiak, R Kelley and M Loewenstein, in\nFrontiers of X-Ray Astronomy 28 [th] Yamada meeting, eds Y Tanaka and K Koyama, Tokyo: Universal Academy Press, 1991, p 221 [5] T Tikkanen and J Huovelin, Nucl Instr",
