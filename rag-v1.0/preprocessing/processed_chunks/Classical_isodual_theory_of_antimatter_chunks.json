    "M Dirac [1] in the late 1920’s in the negative–energy solutions of his celebrated equation Dirac\nhimself soon discovered that particles with negative–energy do not behave in a physical\n\n\n1\n\n\nway and, for this reason, he submitted his celebrated “hole theory”, which subsequently\nrestricted the study of antimatter to the level of second quantization (for historical aspects\non antimatter see, e Dirac\nhimself soon discovered that particles with negative–energy do not behave in a physical\n\n\n1\n\n\nway and, for this reason, he submitted his celebrated “hole theory”, which subsequently\nrestricted the study of antimatter to the level of second quantization (for historical aspects\non antimatter see, e g , Ref [2]) The above occurrence created an imbalance in the physics of this century because matter\nis described at all levels of study, from Newtonian mechanics to quantum field theory, while\nantimatter is solely treated at the level of second quantization To initiate the study for the future removal of this imbalance in due time, in this paper\nwe present a theory of antimatter which has been conceived to begin at the purely classical\nNewtonian level, and then to admit corresponding images at all subsequent levels of study Our guiding principle is to identify a map which possesses the main mathematical structure of charge conjugation, yet it is applicable at all levels, and not solely at the operator\nlevel The main characteristic of charge conjugation is that of being anti–automorphic (or, more\ngenerally, anti–isomorphic) After studying a number of possibilities, a map which is anti–\nisomorphic and applicable at all levels of study, is the following isodual map of any given\nquantity Q\n\n\nQ → Q [d] = −Q [†]",

    "Under the above assumptions, F [d] (a [d], + [d], × [d] ) verifies all the axioms of a field [loc cit ],\nalthough F [d] and F are anti–isomorphic, as desired This establishes that the field of numbers\ncan be equally defined either with respect to the traditional unit +1 or with respect to its\nnegative image -1 The key point is the preservation of the axiomatic character of the latter\nvia the isoduality of the multiplication In other words, the set isodual numbers a [d] with unit\n-1 and conventional product does not constitute a field because I [d] × a [d] ≠ a [d] It is also evident that all operations of numbers implying multiplications must be subjected\nfor consistency to isoduality This implies the isodual square root\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\n2 [d] = −\n�\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\n2 [d] = a [d], 1 [d] [ 1] 2\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\na [d] [ 1] 2\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\n−a [d], a [d] [ 1] 2\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\n2 [d] × [d] a [d] [ 1] 2\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\n2 [d] = −i; (2 8)\n\n\n\n̸\n\n\nthe isodual quotient\n\n\na [d] / [d] b [d] = −(a [d] /b [d] ) = −(a [†] /b [†] =) = c [d], b [d] × [d] c [d] = a [d] ; (2 9)\n\n\nand so on 9)\n\n\nand so on A property of isodual fields of fundamental relevance for our characterization of antimatter is that they have negative–definite norm, called isodual norm [3,4]\n\n\n|a [d] | [d] = |a [†] | × I [d] = −(aa [†] ) [1][/][2] < 0",

    "The novel isodual quantization, the equivalence of isoduality and charge conjugation\nand related operator issues are studied in papers [5,10] To begin our analysis, we note that Hypothesis 3 1 removes the traditional obstacles\nagainst negative energies and masses In fact, particles with negative masses and energies\nreferred to negative units are fully equivalent to particles with positive energy and masses\nreferred to positive units Moreover, as we shall see shortly, particles with negative energy\nreferred to negative units behave in a fully physical way This has permitted the study in\nref [10] of the possible elimination of necessary use of second quantization for the quantum\ncharacterization of antiparticles, as the reader should expect because our main objective is\nthe achievement of equivalent treatments for particles and antiparticles at all levels, thus\nincluding first quantization Hypothesis 3 1 also resolves the additional, well known, problematic aspects of motion\nbackward in time In fact, time moving backward referred to a negative unit is fully equivalent\nto time moving forward referred to a positive unit This confirms the plausibility of the first\nconception of antiparticles by Stueckelberg and others as moving backward in time (see the\nhistorical analysis of Ref [2]), and creates new possibilities for the ongoing research on the\nso-called ”time machine” to be studied in separate works In this section we construct the classical isodual theory of antimatter at the Galilean,\nrelativistic and gravitational levels, prove its axiomatic consistency and verify its compat\n\n11\n\n\nibility with available classical experimental evidence (that on electromagnetic interactions\nonly) We also identify the prediction of the isodual theory that antimatter in the field of\nmatter experiences gravitational repulsion (antigravity), and point out the ongoing efforts\nfor its future experimental resolutions [12,15] For completeness, the classical isodual Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics are provided in the Appendix as the foundation of the\nisoquantization of the joining paper [10] ### 3 2 Representation of antimatter via the classical isodual Galilean relativity We now introduce the isodual Galilean relativity as the most effective way for the classical\nnonrelativistic characterization of antimatter according to Hypothesis 3",
    "We now introduce the isodual Galilean relativity as the most effective way for the classical\nnonrelativistic characterization of antimatter according to Hypothesis 3 1 The study can be initiated with the isodual representation of antimatter at the most\nprimitive dynamical level, that of Newton’s equation Once a complete symmetry between\nthe treatment of matter and antimatter is reached at

mechanics\noutlined in Appendix A We now verify that the above isodual representation of antimatter is indeed consistent\nwith available classical experimental knowledge for antimatter, that under electromagnetic\ninteractions Once this property is established at the primitive Newtonian level, its verification at all subsequent levels of study is expected from mere compatibility arguments Consider a conventional, classical, massive particle and its antiparticle in exterior conditions in vacuum Suppose that the particle and antiparticle have charge −e and +e,\nrespectively (say, an electron and a positron), and that they enter into the gap of a magnet\nB with constant magnetic field\nAs it is well known, visual experimental observation establishes that particles and antiparticles have spiral trajectories of opposite orientation But this behavior occurs for the\nrepresentation of both the particle and its antiparticle in the same Euclidean space The\nsituation under isoduality is different, as described by the following:\n\n\nLemma 3 1: The trajectory of a charged particle in Euclidean space under a magnetic\nfield and the trajectory of the corresponding antiparticle in isodual Euclidean space coincide Proof: Suppose that the particle has negative charge −e in Euclidean space E(r, δ, R),\nthat is, the value −e is defined with respect to the positive unit +1 of the underlying field\nof real numbers R = R(n, +, ×) Suppose that the particle is under the influence of\nthe magnetic field B The characterization of the corresponding antiparticle via isoduality\nimplies the reversal of the sign of all physical quantities, thus yielding the charge (−e) [d] = +e\n\n\n13\n\n\nin the isodual Euclidean space E [d] (r [d], δ [d], R [d] ), as well as the reversal of the magnetic field\nB [d] = −B, although now defined with respect to the negative unit (+1) [d] = −1 It is then\nevident that the trajectory of a particle with charge −e in the field B

interactions equivalent to the electromagnetic\nones, in the sense that the Newtonian gravitational law becomes equivalent to the Coulomb\nlaw Note the impossibility of achieving these results without isoduality The interested reader can verify the persistence of the above results at the relativistic\nand gravitational levels We should indicate that the electroweak behavior of antiparticles is experimentally established nowadays, while there no final experimental knowledge on the gravitational behavior\nof antiparticles is available at this writing 19\n\n\nA first experiment on the gravity of antiparticles was done by Fairbank and Witteborn [20]\nvia low energy positrons in vertical motion, although the measurements were not conclusive\nbecause of interferences from stray fields and other reasons Additional data on the gravity of antiparticles are those from the LEAR machine on\nantiprotons at CERN [21], although these data too are inconclusive because of the excessive\nenergy of the antiprotons as compared to the low magnitude of gravitational effects, the\nsensitivity of the measures and other factors Other information on the gravity of antiparticles is of theoretical character, as reviewed,\ne g , in Ref [22], which outlines various arguments against antigravity, such as those by\nMorrison, Schiff and Good and others The latter arguments do not apply under isodualities\nowing to their essential dependence on positive units, as one can verify The argument against antigravity based on the positronium [22] also do not apply under\nisoduality, because systems of elementary particle–antiparticle are attracted in both fields of\nmatter and antimatter under the isodual theory, as studies in the joint paper [10] Review [22] also indicates models in which the gravity of antimatter in the field of matter\nis weakened, yet it remains attractive We can therefore state that the gravitational behavior of antiparticles is theoretically and\nexperimentally unsettled at this writing The true scientific resolution is evidently that via experiments, such as that proposed\nby Santilli [7] via the use of a suitably collimated beam of very low energy positrons in\nhorizontal flight in a vacuum tube of sufficient length and diameter to yield a resolutory\nanswer, that is, a displacement under gravity at the end of the flight up or down which is\nvisible by the naked eye According to Mills [12], the above experiment appears to be feasible with current technology via the use of µeV positrons in a horizontal vacuum tube of about 100 m in length\nand 1 m in diameter for which stray fields and patch effects should be small as compared to\nthe gravitational deflection A number of additional experimental proposals to measure the\ngravity of antiparticles are available in Proceedings [15], although their measures are more\nsophisticated and not ”visible by the naked eyes” as test [7,12] In closing we indicate that the most forceful argument favoring the existence of antigravity is given by studies on the origin of the gravitational field In fact, the mass of all particles\nconstituting a body has a primary electromagnetic origin, with second–order contributions\nfrom weak and strong interactions By using this established physical evidence, Ref [23]\nproposed the identification (rather than the ”

    "This can be done by identifying the τ –tensor in Eqs (3 26) with the\nelectromagnetic field originating mass, and the τ –tensor with the weak and strong contributions Since the latter are short range, in the exterior problem in vacuum we would only\nhave the identification of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields which would evidently\nimply the equivalence of the respective phenomenologies, thus including the capability for\nattractive and repulsive forces for both fields Note that this implies the existence of a first–order nowhere null electromagnetic source\nalso for bodies with null total charge (see Ref Note that this implies the existence of a first–order nowhere null electromagnetic source\nalso for bodies with null total charge (see Ref [23] for details) Note also the full compatibility of the above argument with the isodual representation of antimatter, because both\napproaches imply the equivalence of Coulomb’s law for charges with Newton’s law for masses The forceful nature of the above argument is due to the fact that the lack of antigravity\n\n\n20\n\n\nwould imply the lack of identity of gravitational and electromagnetic interactions In turn,\nthis would require a revision of the contemporary theory of elementary particles in such a\nway to avoid the primary electromagnetic origin of their mass In turn,\nthis would require a revision of the contemporary theory of elementary particles in such a\nway to avoid the primary electromagnetic origin of their mass APPENDIX A A 1: Isodual Lagrangian mechanics After having verified the isodual theory of antimatter at the primitive Newtonian level,\nit may be of some value to outline its analytic representation because it constitutes the\nfoundations of the novel quantization for antimatter studied in the joint paper [10] 1\nA conventional (first–order) Lagrangian L(t, x, v) = 2 [mv] [k] [v] [k] [ +][ V][ (][t, x, v][) on the con-]\nfiguration space E(t, x, v) = E(t, R t ) × E(r, δ, R r ) × E(v, δ, R v ) of Newton’s equations is\nmapped under isoduality into the negative value L [d] (t [d], r [d], v [d] ) = −L defined on isodual\nspace E [d] (t [d], r [d], v [d] ) of Eq (3 2) The isodual Lagrange equations are then given by\n\n\n\nd [d]\n\nd [d] t [d] [d∂] [d] [L] [d] ∂ [(][t] [d][d] v [, r] [kd][d] [, v] [d] [)]\n\n\n\nd = 0, (A 35)\n∂ [d] r [kd]\n\n\n\nd [d]\n\n\n\n\n[(][t] [d] [, r] [d] [, v] [d] [)]\n\nd − [∂] [d] [L] [d] [(][t] [d] [, r] [d] [, v] [d] [)]\n∂ [d] v [kd] ∂ [d] r [kd]\n\n\n\nAll various aspects of the isodual Lagrangian mechanics can then be readily derived It is easy to see that Lagrange’s equations change sign under isoduality and can therefore\nprovide a direct representation (i",
