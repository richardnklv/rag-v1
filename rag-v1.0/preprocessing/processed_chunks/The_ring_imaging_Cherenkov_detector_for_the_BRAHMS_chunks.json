    "## The ring imaging Cerenkov detector for the [ˇ] BRAHMS Experiment at RHIC\n\n#### R Debbe, S Gushue, B Moskowitz, J Olness, F Olness, F Videbæk\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York 11973, USA\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nA ring-imaging Cerenkov counter, to be read out by four 100-channel PMT’s, is a [ˇ]\nkey element of the BRAHMS Experiment We report here the most recent results\nobtained with a prototype tested at the BNL AGS using several radiator gases,\nincluding the heavy fluorocarbon C 4 F 10 Ring radii were measured for different\nparticles (π [−], µ [−], e [−] ) for momenta ranging from 2 to 12 GeV/c employing pure\nC 4 F 10 as radiator 1 The BRAHMS Experiment\n\n\nThe BRAHMS Experiment at RHIC consists of two magnetic spectrometer\narms that will survey particle production in Au - Au collisions at 100 GeV/c\nper nucleon The goal of the experiment is to study the system formed by the\ntwo colliding ions in two regions of rapidity A schematic description of the\nBRAHMS setup is shown in Figure 1 The Midrapidity Arm will probe the\nparticles emerging near y ≈ 0, corresponding to spectrometer angles between\n30 [◦] and 90 [◦] with respect to the beam line The Forward Arm will study particles of higher rapidities, y ≤ 4, corresponding to spectrometer angles ranging\nfrom 2 [◦] to 30 [◦] The particle identification is accomplished in each spectrometer with a combination of Time of Flight arrays and Cerenkov counters Of particular interest [ˇ]\nfor this presentation is the Particle Identification system (PID) of the Forward Arm spectrometer, which must identify charged particles with momenta\nranging from 1 to 25 GeV/c Particle identification at high momentum is done with the second Time of\nFlight wall H2 and the Ring Imaging Cerenkov detector RICH Assuming the [ˇ]\nexpected time resolution of σ = 75 psec, H2 will be able to separate pions\nfrom kaons up to 5 8 GeV/c and kaons from protons up to 8 5 GeV/c The\n\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 19 July 2018\n\n\nfunction of the RICH detector is to extend the particle identification up to 25\nGeV/c Some considerations of its design are given in the following subsection 2 Design of the RICH detector for BRAHMS\n\n\nFigure 2 shows three aspects of the proposed detector, indicating various components and dimensions The lateral dimensions of the radiator volume are\nsomewhat larger than the aperture of D4 (h × w = 40 × 50cm [2] ) The radiator\nhas L = 1 5 meters of C 4 F 10, which at 20 [◦] C and 1 25 atm pressure has an\nindex of refraction n = 1 00185",
    "00185 The spherical mirror has a focal length of 1 5\nm and is rotated by an angle α = 8 [◦], thus shifting the ring image (by 2α) to\na focal plane outside of the volume illuminated by the direct particle flux The photon-imaging array consists of four Hamamatsu R-4549-01 detectors,\nplaced as indicated, defining an image plane some 22 × 22cm [2] The expected performance of this detector, in terms of particle resolution\nand efficiency, have been outlined previously, [2],[3], and are supported by the\nresults of the prototype tests presented in the following section and also in\nRef [1] Simulations have been performed using event generators appropiate for AuAu collisions, in order to determine the multiplicities expected for the various\ndetectors of the Forward arm Table 1 shows the pertinent data for the RICH\ndetector, indicating typically one or at most two charged particles per event Hits per event Hits per event\n\n\np=7 5-15 GeV/c p=15-30 GeV/c\n\n\nPrimary 0 9 0 29\n\n\nSecondary 0 5 0 39\n\n\nAbove threshold 0 8 0 30\n\nTable 1\n\nAverage charged particle hits in the RICH detector\n\n\n3 The Prototype Detector\n\n\nThe prototype RICH counter is shown schematically in figure 3 of Ref [1] [1] The prototype is similar in general design to that shown in figure 2, but with\nthe optical system rotated by 90 [◦] about the beam axis, such that the reflection\nangle is now in the horizontal plane 2\n\n\nThe detector housing is constructed as a rectangular box, with 2 cm thick\naluminum walls, having inner dimensions of 127×64×46 cm [3] (l × w × h) The\nconstruction is such that, using gasket and o-ring seals, the pressure of the\nradiator gas may be safely varied from 0 to 1 5 atm absolute",
    "5 atm absolute The particle\nbeam enters and exits through Mylar windows 0 25 mm thick and 15 cm in\ndiameter, at opposite ends of the long dimension A 15-cm diameter spherical\nmirror, of focal length f = 91 4 cm, is situated at a radiator distance of L =\n114 cm, rotated by α = 8 [◦] A single 100-channel PMT is centered at α = 16 [◦]\n\nat the 91 cm distant focal plane The photon detector was a single Hamamatsu R-4549-01, one element of the\nfour proposed for BRAHMS This PMT is a 20-stage device having a 10 ×\n10cm [2] photocathode, with the segmentation defined by a 10 × 10 array of\n0 9 × 0 9cm [2] anode elements At the full operating voltage of 2500 Volts, it\nprovides a current gain of 2 × 10 [7] producing single-photon pulses large enough\nto be fed directly to an ADC or timing electronics This specific module employs a special focussing electrode (between cathode\nand first dynode) which results in a rectangular flat-topped response function\n10 × 10mm [2], with a very sharp fall off at the edges While the photocathode\nitself is quite uniform, the gain falls off a bit (50%) near the edges of the array,\nand even more at the four corners However the signal remains clean, and so\nthe gain can be compensated in software However the signal remains clean, and so\nthe gain can be compensated in software Four identical drift chambers, placed in pairs upstream and dowstream of the\nprototype counter, provided tracking for determining the particle trajectory Thus, the expected position of the center of each RICH ring on the phototube\nis determined to a resolution of approximately 500 µm in both the x and y\ndirections 4 Measurements\n\n\nIn previous tests [1], time limitations did not permit a complete filling of\nthe radiator volume with pure C 4 F 10 Our filling system was based on the\ndifference (factor of six) in the molecular weights of the fluorocarbon and\nargon, with the heavy gas displacing the lighter one as it is brought into\nthe bottom of the detector In reality we found that even though the flow of\nC 4 F 10 into the detector was slow, some mixing occurs and 100% concentrations\ncannot be reached in a single cycle The measurements reported in our previous\npublication were done with ≈ 70% C 4 F 10 and 30% Argon This time we simply\nevacuated the radiator volume completely and then filled with pure C 4 F 10 Measurements were made for several particle momenta, over the range 2 ≤\n\n\n3\n\n\np ≤ 12 GeV/c, using the (negative) secondary beam from the BNL AGS\naccelerator (The momentum calibration for the beam-line was established in\na separate measurement, employing time-of-flight techniques, to an accuracy\nof better than 0 5%)",
    "5%) For each setting, the tracking information from four drift\nchambers was used to project the expected ring centers onto the PMT matrix Given this information, a ring-fitting algorithm was employed to find and fit\nthe ring radius on an event by event basis The results are shown in Fig 3,\nwhich plots observed ring-radius versus beam momentum for particles thus\nidentified as electrons, muons, and pions The solid curves are calculated for\nthe indicated particles, with the focal length and index of refraction as free\nparameters Both results can be seen to agree well with the known value,f =\n91 4 cm, and the calculated index of refraction (at 20 [◦] C, 1 atm ≈ 400 nm) n\n= 1 001379 (this index is calculated using measurements in the liquid phase\nreported in [5]) 001379 (this index is calculated using measurements in the liquid phase\nreported in [5]) We have investigated the possibility that for larger rings (r≥4 5 cm) edgeeffects may be of importance, resulting in extracted radii somewhat too small For this purpose, the spherical mirror was further rotated by an additional\n1 [◦] to α=9 [◦] The projected ring center was therefore moved by 3 4 cm, such\nthat one arc of the ring image was well inside the PMT’s photocathode area The results for this comparison are shown in Fig 3 for the electron data at\n3 GeV/c As can be seen, the effect produces, at most, a minimal displacement\nin the direction that might have been expected As remarked previously [1], the direct determination of the number of photons\ndetected for a given event is precluded by the exponential shape of the PMT\nsingle-photon response function Instead, we have measured (over a large number of events) the statistical variation in the total charge collected per event ≈\nThe resultant distribution ( Gaussian) is then fitted to determine the measured mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ) The number of detected photons\n(n) may then be estimated as n = (µ/σ [′] ) [2], where σ [′] is deduced by unfolding\nthe exponential detector response function We thus estimated (for 12 GeV/c\npions) that n = 26 ± 4, corresponding to N 0 = 89 ± 14 cm [−][1] 5 Summary\n\n\nThe predicted behavior of the RICH detector proposed for BRAHMS has been\ninvestigated and confirmed by these additional measurements with the prototype detector, which were carried out under carefully controlled conditions The imaging capabilities (see Fig 3) and figure of merit (N 0 ) are found to be\nin good agreement with expectations based on the design and performance of\nthe individual components 4\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\nThis work was supported by U S Department of Energy contract number DEAC02-76CH00016, in part through the R &D funds of the RHIC Project, and\nwe thank T Ludlam for his encouragement in this enterprise",
