as Sir H Manwaring’s Seaman’s Dictionary; Boteler’s Sea\nDialogues; Guillet’s Gentleman’s Dictionary, and Blanckley’s Naval\nExpositor, &c Far from exhibiting an enlarged and comprehensive\nview of naval affairs, these productions are extremely imperfect,\naccording to the very circumscribed plan which their authors have\nadopted There are besides, the Dictionaire de Marine of M Aubin,\npublished in Holland; and that of M Saverien, published in France These are indeed voluminous, but very deficient in the most necessary\narticles Besides a circumstantial detail of the local oeconomy of\ndifferent marine departments, they are swelled out with astronomy,\nnavigation, hydrography, natural history, &c all of which are\nabundantly better treated in other compositions Of the machinery of\na ship; the disposition of the rigging on her masts and yards; and the\ncomparative force of her different mechanical powers, their accounts\nhowever are often vague, perplexed, and unintelligible With regard to her internal government in action; to the general\nregulations of the line of battle; and to the principal movements in\nsailing, they are almost totally silent Had any of these works been\nexecuted with tolerable success, it might have rendered mine\nunnecessary; or probably have introduced it in the form of a\ntranslation I acknowledge with great pleasure the advantages I have derived in\nthe prosecution of this work, from several authors of distinguished\nreputation: in reality however none of those above-mentioned are of\nthe number In that part which is dedicated to the theory and art of\nship-building, I owe considerable obligations to the ingenious M Du\nHamel The principal pieces used in the construction of a ship,\ntogether with their combination and disposition, are copiously and\n\n\naccurately described in his Elements of Naval Architecture: and his\ngeneral account of the art itself is perspicuous and comprehensive Many of his explanations I have therefore implicitly adopted In treating of the artillery, I have occasionally consulted Le Blond,\nMuller, and Robins, besides selecting some valuable materials from the\nmanuscripts of officers of long experience and established reputation\nin that service Whatever relates to the rigging, sails, machinery, and\nmovements of a ship; or to the practice of naval war, is generally\ndrawn from my own observations; unless where the author is quoted As there are abundance of books professedly written on astronomy,\nand the theory of navigation, I have totally omitted the terms of the\nformer, as foreign to my plan; and slightly passed over the latter:\nbecause no reader could acquire a sufficient idea of those sciences\nfrom so partial a description Many of the least important parts of a\nship, as well as of her rigging, are very generally defined To explain\nthe track of every particular rope, through its different channels,\nwould be equally useless and unintelligible to a land reader: to\nmariners it were superfluous: and even the youths who are trained to\nthe sea, would reap little advantage from it; because their situation\naffords them much better opportunities of making these minute\ndiscoveries I have in general endeavoured to give the etymology of the most\nmaterial expressions, unless when their evident analogy to common\nwords rendered this unnecessary Many reasons may be alledged for\nintroducing the French sea-terms and phrases; particularly that\nobvious one, of understanding their pilots, when we may have\noccasion for their assistance Wherever it was found necessary to\nexplain one technical term by another, the latter is usually printed in\nitalics the first time it is mentioned; so that the reader may refer to it\nfor a further explanation As the plates of this publication were intended to illustrate the\nvarious objects to which they refer, they are little ornamented; but\nhave in general the recommendation of simplicity and geometrical\ntruth In this part I have been particularly favoured with many\noriginal drawings, which are usually considered amongst the\ninaccessible arcana of ship-building They are much more numerous,\nuseful, and correct, than what has hitherto appeared in any work of\nthe kind In fine, I have endeavoured, to the best of my judgment, to\nretrench the superfluities, and supply the deficiences of former writers\non the same subject, as well as to digest and methodise whatever\n\n\nappeared loose or inaccurate therein This undertaking was first suggested to me by my worthy and\ningenious friend George Lewis Scott, Esq; who considered it as a work\nof extensive utility, Indeed, in a country whose principal sources of\nstrength are derived from the superiority of her marine, it is evidently\nwanted I have the pleasure also to know that Sir Edward Hawke, and\nseveral officers of respectable abilities in our navy, are of the same\nopinion To this may be added, what the celebrated M Du Hamel\nlately observed, in a letter to me, s I mention this expressly, because\nsome sea-officers have considered the work unnecessary It is however\nsubmitted, with all possible deference, to superior judges; to men of\nscience and letters, who know the difficulty of explaining the parts of\na mechanical system, when the readers are unacquainted with the\nsubject A\nLIST of the SUBSCRIBERS His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland Right Hon Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, as a Board A\nCapt Abdy, of the Navy\nJohn Adam, Esq;\nRobert Adam, Esq;\nJames Adam, Esq;\nWilliam Adam, Esq;\nAlex Anderson, Esq;\nCapt Alwright, of the Navy\nCapt Antrobus, ditto\nMr Richard Atkinson, 2 copies\nLondon Assurance Office\nRoyal Exchange Assurance Office\nB\nHis Grace the Duke of Beaufort\nRight Hon Earl of Berkeley\n\n\nRight Hon Lord Bottetourt\nRight Hon John Buller, Lord of the\nAdmiralty Col Bendyshe\nHon George Berkeley\nThe Rev Dr Blair\nCapt Bentinck, of the Navy\nCapt George Bowyer, of ditto\nMr Robert Baynes\nEdward Hugh Boscawen, Esq;\nWilliam Glanville Boscawen, Esq;\nJohn Boddington, Esq;\nJohn Blair, Esq;

    "ABREAST, par le travers (of breost, Sax ), side by side, or opposite to;\na situation in which two or more ships lie, with their sides parallel to\neach other, and their heads equally advanced This term more particularly regards the line of battle at sea, where,\non the different occasions of attack, retreat, or pursuit, the several\nsquadrons, or divisions of a fleet, are obliged to vary their\ndispositions, and yet maintain a proper regularity by sailing in right or\ncurved lines When the line is formed abreast, the whole squadron\nadvances uniformly, the ships being equally distant from, and parallel\nto each other, so that the length of each ship forms a right angle with\nthe extent of the squadron or line abreast The commander in chief is\nalways stationed in the center, and the second and third in command\nin the centers of their respective squadrons See this farther illustrated\nin the article Line Abreast, within the ship, implies on a line with the beam, or by\nthe side of any object aboard; as, the frigate sprung a leak abreast of\nthe main hatch-way, i e on the same line with the main hatch-way,\ncrossing the ship’s length at right angles, in opposition to afore or\nabaft the hatch-way See Abaft We discovered a fleet Abreast of Beachy-Head, i e off, or directly\nopposite thereto ACORN, pomme de girouette, a little ornamental piece of wood,\nfashioned like a cone, and fixed on the uppermost point of the\nspindle, above the vane, on the mast-head It is used to keep the vane\nfrom being blown off from the spindle in a whirlwind, or when the\nship leans much to one side under sail See plate I fig 1 where a\nrepresents the acorn, b the vane and stock, c the spindle, and d the\nmast-head ADMIRAL, amiral, an officer of the first rank and command in the\nfleet, and who is distinguished by a flag displayed at his main-top-\n\n\nmast-head Also an officer who superintends the naval forces of a\nnation, and who is authorised to determine in all maritime causes The origin and denomination of this important office, which seems\nto have been established in most countries that border on the sea,\nhave given rise to a great variety of opinions Some have borrowed\nthem from the Greek, others from the Arabic, while a third sort, with\ngreater probability, derive both the title and dignity from the\nSaracens [1] But since no certain conclusions have been deduced from\nthese elaborate researches, and as it rather appears the province of\nthis work to give the reader an idea of the office and duty of an\nadmiral at sea, than to furnish an historical or chronological detail of\nthe rank and power with which admirals have been invested in\ndifferent nations, we shall contentedly resign this task to the\ningenious lexicographers who have so repeatedly entertained us with\nsuch critical investigations The Admiral, or commander in chief of a fleet, being frequently\ninvested with a great charge, on which the fate of a kingdom may\ndepend, ought certainly to be possessed of abilities equal to so\nimportant a station and so extensive a command His fleet is\nunavoidably exposed to a variety of perplexing situations in a\nprecarious element A train of dangerous incidents necessarily arise\nfrom those situations The health, order, and discipline of his people,\nare not less the objects of his consideration, than the condition and\nqualities of his ships A sudden change of climate, a rank and\ninfectious air, a scarcity, or unwholsomness of provisions, may be as\npernicious to the former, as tempestuous weather or dangerous\nnavigation to the latter A lee-shore, an injudicious engagement with\nan enemy greatly superior, may be equally fatal to both He ought to\nhave sufficient experience to anticipate all the probable events that\nmay happen to his fleet during an expedition or cruise, and, by\nconsequence, to provide against them His skill should be able to\ncounter-act the various disasters which his fleet may suffer from\ndifferent causes His vigilance and presence of mind are necessary to\nseize every favourable opportunity that his situation may offer to\nprosecute his principal design; to extricate himself from any difficulty\nor distress; to check unfortunate events in the beginning, and retard\nthe progress of any great calamity He should be endued with\nresolution and fortitude to animate his officers by the force of\nexample, and promote a sense of emulation in those who are under\nhis command, as well to improve any advantage, as to frustrate or\n\n\ndefeat the efforts of his ill fortune The most essential part of his duty, however, appears to be military\nconduct As soon as the fleet under his command puts to sea, he is to\nform it into the proper order of battle, called the Line In this\narrangement he is to make a judicious distribution of strength from\nthe van to the rear, throwing the principal force into the center, to\nresist the impression of the enemy’s fleet; which might otherwise, at\nsome favourable opportunity, break through his line, and throw the\nvan and rear into confusion A competent knowledge of the seas, weather, and reigning winds, of\nthe coast or region where he is stationed, is also requisite, as it will\ngreatly facilitate his plans on the enemy It will enable him to avoid\nbeing improperly embayed, where he might be surprised in a\ndisadvantageous situation; and to judge whether it will be most\nexpedient to attack his adversary, or lie prepared to receive his\nassault When his fleet is forced by stress of weather or otherwise to\ntake shelter in a road or bay, it will likewise suggest the necessary\nconduct of keeping a sufficient number of cruisers at sea, to bring him\nearly intelligence, that they may be ready to cut or slip the cables\nwhen they are too much hurried to weigh their anchors As the forming a complete, strong, and uniform line is a very\nmaterial article in naval war, the admiral ought frequently to arrange\nthe fleet under his command into this order, that the inferior officers\nmay observe to bring their ships, with greater dexterity and alertness,\ninto their several stations, and maintain the regularity of the line\nwhen they tack, veer, or sail abreast See Line When the admiral intends a descent on an enemy’s coast, or other\nattack which may be attended with complicated and unforeseen\nincidents, his orders should be delivered or drawn up with the\ngreatest accuracy and precision: they should be simple, perspicuous,\ndirect, and comprehensive; they should collect a number of objects\ninto one point of view, and, foreseeing the effects of success or defeat,\nappoint the proper measures to be adopted in consequence thereof History and experience confirm the necessity of this observation, and\npresent us with a variety of disasters that have happened on such\noccasions, merely by a deficiency in this material article In the\ncommanding officer, inattention, barrenness of expedient, or a\ncircumscribed view of the necessary effects of his enterprize, may be\nequally pernicious And general orders ought to be utterly free from\npedantry and perplexity, which always betray a false taste and\n\n\nconfused imagination, besides the probability of producing many fatal\nconsequences When an admiral conquers in battle, he should endeavour to\nimprove his victory, by pushing the advantages he has acquired as far\nas prudence directs; a conduct which merits his attention as much as\nany in the action When he is defeated, he ought to embrace every\nopportunity of saving as many of his ships as possible, and endeavour\nprincipally to assist those which are disabled In short, it is his duty to\navail himself of every practicable expedient rather than sink under his\nmisfortune, and suffer himself to become an easy prey to the enemy He should be sufficiently acquainted with civil law, to judge with\npropriety of the proceedings of courts-martial, and to correct the\nerrors, and restrain the abuses which may happen therein by mistake,\nor ignorance, or inattention As secret treaties, propositions, or schemes of the enemy, may\noccasionally be submitted to his inspection, or fall into his possession\nby capture; and which it might be improper to discover to any person\nnear him, he ought to have a competent knowledge of the modern\nlanguages, or at least, those of the countries against whom his\nmilitary operations are directed, to be able to comprehend with\nfacility the full scope and purport of such papers He ought to be well versed in geometry, to order proper and correct\nsurveys of unknown coasts, roads, or harbours to be made, and to\njudge of their accuracy, and detect their errors To ascertain the\nsituation and longitude of different places, he should be also\nsufficiently skilled in astronomy, and the method of taking\nobservations, which indeed is essentially necessary to the profession\nof a sea-officer, although too much neglected By his orders the admiral is likewise to assist at all councils of war\nthat relate to naval affairs: to visit, as often as convenient, the other\nships of his squadron: to enquire particularly into their condition, and\nobserve the men mustered, taking care that no supernumeraries are\nborne on the books He is directed to acquaint the secretary of the\nadmiralty of all his proceedings relating to the service, for the\ninformation of the lord-high-admiral, or lords commissioners of the\nadmiralty; and to attend him or them, on his return home, with an\naccount of his voyage or expedition, and to transmit a copy of his\njournal to their secretary Much more might be observed on this occasion It appears however\nby the general outline which we have sketched, that the office and\n\n\nduty of an admiral requires greater skill and more comprehensive\nabilities than is generally supposed necessary to the command of a\nnaval armament And that he ought to be duly qualified, at least in\nthis kingdom, to assist at the councils of his sovereign, and enter into\nthe enlarged system of protecting his country from an invasion by sea,\nor of meditating a descent on an enemy’s coast; as well as to improve\nnavigation, and open new channels of commerce For further\nparticulars of his charge, see the articles Engagement, Line,\nSquadron Admiral of the fleet, the highest officer under the admiralty of\nGreat-Britain: when he embarks on any expedition, he is distinguished\nby the union flag at the main-top-mast-head Vice-Admiral, vice-Amiral, the officer next in rank and command to\nadmiral;

    "Potter’s\nAntiquities of Greece The anchors now made are contrived so as to sink into the ground\nas soon as they reach it, and to hold a great strain before they can be\n\n\nloosened or dislodged from their station They are composed of a\nshank, a stock, a ring, and two arms with their flukes The stock,\nwhich is a long piece of timber fixed across the shank, serves to guide\nthe flukes in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the ground; so\nthat one of them sinks into it by its own weight as soon as it falls, and\nis still preserved steadily in that position by the stock, which, together\nwith the shank, lies flat on the bottom In this situation it must\nnecessarily sustain a great effort before it can be dragged through the\nearth horizontally Indeed this can only be effected by the violence of\nthe wind or tide, or of both of them, sometimes increased by the\nturbulence of the sea, and acting upon the ship so as to stretch the\ncable to its utmost tension, which accordingly may dislodge the\nanchor from its bed, especially if the ground be soft and oozy or\nrocky When the anchor is thus displaced, it is said, in the sea phrase,\nto come home That the figure of this useful instrument may be more clearly\nunderstood, let us suppose a long massy beam of iron erected\nperpendicularly, Plate I fig 2 b c; at the lower end of which are two\narms, d e, of equal thickness with the beam (usually called the shank)\nonly that they taper towards the points, which are elevated above the\nhorizontal plane at an angle of thirty degrees; or inclined to the shank\nat an angle of sixty degrees: on the upper part of each arm (in this\nposition) is a fluke, or thick plate of iron, g h, commonly shaped like\nan isosceles triangle, whose base reaches inwards to the middle of the\narm On the upper-end of the shank is fixed the stock transversely\nwith the flukes: the stock is a long beam of oak, f, in two parts,\nstrongly bolted, and hooped together with iron rings See also fig 3",
    "3 Close above the stock is the ring, a, to which the cable is fastened, or\nbent: the ring is curiously covered with a number of pieces of short\nrope, which are twisted about it so as to form a very thick texture or\ncovering, called the puddening, and used to preserve the cable from\nbeing fretted or chafed by the iron Every ship has, or ought to have, three principal anchors, with a\ncable to each, viz the sheet, maitresse-ancre, (which is the anchora\nsacra of the antients) the best bower, second ancre, and small bower,\nancre d’ affourche, so called from their usual situation on the ship’s\nbows There are besides smaller anchors, for removing a ship from\nplace to place in a harbour or river, where there may not be room or\nwind for sailing; these are the stream-anchor, ancre de touei; the kedge\nand grappling, grapin; this last, however, is chiefly designed for boats To drag the Anchors, chasser sur ses ancres, implies the effort of\nmaking the anchor come home, when the violence of the wind, &c strains the cable so as to tear it up from the bed into which it had\nsunk, and drag it along the ground; as already explained Foul-Anchor: it is so called when it either hooks some other\nanchor, wreck, or cable, under the surface of the water; or when, by\nthe wind suddenly abating, the ship slackens her strain, and straying\nround the bed of her anchor, entangles her slack cable about the\nupper fluke of it, and easily draws it out of its place, as soon as she\nbegins to ride with a strain To prevent this, it is usual, as she\napproaches the anchor, in light winds, to draw the slack cable into the\nship as fast as possible To Anchor, ancrer, mouiller, &c is to let go the anchor, and to let\nthe ship ride thereby The Anchor is a cock-bill, ancre est àla vielle, implies that the shank-\npainter, or rope by which the flukes were hung to the ship’s bow,\nbeing cast off, the flukes drop down perpendicularly; whilst the\nanchor is suspended at the cat-head by its stopper, ready to be sunk\nfrom the bow at a moment’s warning At Anchor, à l’ ancre, the situation of a ship which rides by her\nanchor in a road or haven, &c Plate I fig 6 represents the fore-part\nof a ship, as riding in this situation The Anchor is a peek See the article Apeek The Anchor is a-trip, or a-weigh See those articles To back the Anchor See Back To cat the Anchor, caponner l’ancre, is to hook a tackle called the\ncat to its ring, and thereby pull it up close to the cat-head, which see To fish the Anchor, to draw up the flukes upon the ship’s side after\nit is catted See the articles Davit and Fish To sheer the ship to her Anchor, gouverner sur l’ancre, is to steer the\nship’s head towards the place where the anchor lies when they are\nheaving the cable into the ship; that the cable may thereby enter the\nhause with less resistance, and the ship advance towards the anchor\nwith greater facility To shoe the Anchor See the article Shoe To weigh the Anchor, lever l’ancre, to heave the anchor out of the\nground by its cable See Capstern and Windlass To weigh the Anchor with the long-boat, lever l’ancre avec la\nchaloupe, is to draw it up by applying mechanical powers to the buoy-\nrope, and thereby pull it up to the boat’s stem or stern To weigh the Anchor by the hair, is to weigh it by the cable in a\nboat, when the ship cannot approach it, or when the buoy rope is\nbroke See the French term Ancre, and the phrases which succeed in\norder Anchor-ground, fond de bonne tenue, is a bottom which is neither\ntoo deep, too shallow, nor rocky; as in the first the cable bears too\nnearly perpendicular, and is thereby apt to jerk the anchor out of the\nground: in the second, the ship’s bottom is apt to strike at low water,\nor when the sea runs high, by which she is exposed to the danger of\nsinking: and in the third, the anchor is liable to hook the broken and\npointed ends of rocks, and tear away its flukes; whilst the cable, from\nthe same cause, is constantly in danger of being cut through as it rubs\non their edges APEEK, (à pique, Fr ) perpendicular to the anchor; a ship is said to\nbe in this situation, when the cable is drawn so tight into the bow as\nto, bring her directly over the anchor, so that the cable bears right\ndown from the ship’s stem APRON, (from a and foran, Sax ) a platform, or flooring of plank,\nraised at the entrance of a dock, a little higher than the bottom,\nagainst which the dock gates are shut See the article Dock Apron, contre etrave, in ship-building, a piece of curved timber\nfixed behind the lower part of the stem, immediately above the\nforemost end of the keel See plate I fig H in the Pieces of the Hull The Apron conforms exactly to the shape of the stem, so that when\nthe convexity of the former is applied to the concavity of the latter, it\nforms one solid piece, which serves to fortify the stem, and give it a\nfirmer connexion with the keel As the apron is composed of two pieces scarfed together, and used\nto support she scarf of the stem, it is necessary that the scarf thereof\nshould be at some distance from that of the stem It is formed of the\nsame thickness with the heel of the stem; but its thickness is equal\nthroughout Sometimes the piece immediately under the apron forms\na curve, of which the horizontal part covers the dead-wood, whilst the\nvertical part corresponds with the inside of the stem, to which it is\nfayed, making the commencement of the apron Naval ARCHITECTURE       Plate i",

to\nassemble and unite them into a firm, compact frame, so that by their\ncombination and disposition they may form a solid fabric, sufficient to\nanswer all the purposes for which it is intended: And,\nThirdly, To provide convenient accommodations for the officers and\ncrew, as well as suitable apartments for the cargo, furniture,\nprovisions, artillery and ammunition The exterior figure of a ship may be divided into the bottom and\nupper-works The bottom, or quick-work, contains what is termed the hold, and\nwhich is under water when the ship is laden The upper-works, called\nalso the dead-work, comprehend all that part which is usually above\nthe water when the ship is laden The figure of the bottom is therefore determined by the qualities\nwhich are necessary for the vessel, and conformable to the service for\nwhich she is proposed The limits of our design will not admit of a minute description, and\nenumeration of all the pieces of timber which enter into the\nconstruction of a ship, nor of a particular description of their\n\n\nassemblage and union; or the manner in which they reciprocally\ncontribute to the solidity of those floating citadels It nevertheless\nappears necessary to give a general idea of the use, figure, and station,\nof the principal pieces, to those who are intirely unacquainted with\nthe subject As our definitions will be greatly illustrated also by the\nproper figures, we have annexed to this article a plate which\ncomprehends some of the most material draughts, as well as a\nrepresentation of the principal pieces employed in naval architecture It is usual amongst shipwrights to delineate three several draughts First, The whole length of the ship is represented according to a\nside view, perpendicular to the keel, and is termed the plane of\nelevation, or sheer-draught Plate I Second, The ship is exhibited according to an end view, and\nstripped of her planks, so as to present the outlines of the principal\ntimbers; and this is properly termed the plane of projection, or the\nvertical plane of the timbers, Plate I because it shews the projection\nof their frames relatively to each other Third, It is not sufficient to have the vertical curves of the bottom in\ndifferent places, for a distinct idea of the horizontal curves is also\nequally necessary and useful: this is obtained by means of water-lines,\ntraced upon what is called the horizontal plane In this draught, the\ncurves of the transoms called the round-aft, is also marked, and\nsometimes the breadth and thickness of the timbers The plane of elevation, plate I determines the length and depth of\nthe keel; the difference of the draughts of water; the length and\nprojection, or rake, of the stem and stern-post; the position of the mid-\nship frame upon the keel, together with that of the principal frames\nafore and abaft; the load-water-line; the wales, the dimensions and\nsituations of the gun-ports, the projection of the rails of the head and\nstern-gallery, with the stations of the masts and channels See the\narticle Elevation This draught, however, conveys no idea of the vertical curve of the\nribs or timbers; for as their projection will be only represented in a\nplane elevated upon the length of the keel, they will appear in this\ndirection no otherwise than as streight lines To perceive these curves\naccurately, they must be regarded in another point of view, which will\nrepresent their projection upon a vertical plane, supposed to cut the\nkeel at right angles in the place where the ship is broadest For as all\nships are broader near the middle of their length than towards the\nextremities, it is evident that the timbers are more extended in\n\n\nproportion The most capacious of these represents what is called the\nmidship-frame; and upon the area of this frame is delineated the\nprojection of all the others Thus the plane of projection limits the different breadths of a ship\nin various points of her length, and exhibits the outline of the timbers\nrespectively to each other, as they are erected upon the keel Accordingly, this draught ought to present a variety of sections of the\nship in different places of her length, and always perpendicular to the\nsurface of the water; so that the eye of the observer, when placed in\nwhat may be properly termed the axis of the ship, may perceive the\nseveral sections at one glance, that is to say, when looking full on the\nstem, from before the ship, (See plate V fig 4 ) he shall discover the\nfore-timbers; and when looking from behind, directly on the stern, he\nshall perceive the form of the after-timbers, (See plate X fig 2 and 3 )\nin both of which figures the sections of the inferior timbers are\nexpressed by curved black lines drawn upon the area of the midship-\nframe, which is already described to be a plane elevated\nperpendicularly upon the keel at the extreme breadth of the vessel To form a just idea of this plane, therefore, we ought to suppose a\nship resting upon the stocks, in the same position as when afloat upon\nthe water Thus a variety of black vertical lines may be drawn at\nequal distances upon the bottom, which is white, to form different\noutlines of the ship corresponding to the timbers within It is to be\nobserved, that the fashion of the inferior timbers must conform to the\nfigure of the midship-frame, which is placed in the fullest part of the\nship; and as the planes of all the other timbers diminish in a certain\nprogression as they approach the stem and stern, they are properly\ndelineated on the plane of the midship-frame, which also represents\nthe depth of the keel and length of the midship-beam As the two sides of a ship ought to be exactly alike, it is judged\nsufficient to represent the sections of the fore-part of the ship on the\nleft side, and those in the after-part on the right side, so as to perceive\nall the sections, as well afore as abaft, upon one plane See plate I Projection However necessary it may be to understand precisely the vertical\ncurves of the bottom, it is no less requisite to have a just idea of those\nwhich are horizontal The horizontal, or floor plane, is that upon which the whole frame\nis erected, and will be more clearly understood by previously\ndescribing the water-lines and ribbands, of which it is composed When a ship floats upon the stream, it is evident that her upper-\nworks will be separated from the bottom by the surface of the water,\nwhich will accordingly describe an imaginary horizontal line upon the\nbottom from the stem to the stern-post The most elevated of those lines is termed the load-water-line,\nwhich is supposed to be drawn by the surface of the water on the\nupper part of the bottom, when she is sufficiently laden for a sea-\nvoyage For if we suppose this surface a rule, and thereby describe a\ncorresponding black line along the vessel’s bottom, that line will be\ndistinguished upon the bottom, which is white, and represent what is\ncalled the load-water-line If the ship is lightened of any part of her lading, and preserves the\nsame difference in her draught of water at the two ends, or, what is\nthe same thing, if she is lightened so as to preserve the same\nequilibrium of the keel with regard to the surface of the water, it is\nevident that she will rise higher out of the water, so that the black\nline already described will be elevated above it, and another black\nline may be delineated upon the bottom, close to the surface of the\nwater, which will exhibit a second water-line parallel to the first, but\nnearer the keel in proportion to the number of feet which the ship has\nrisen Thus by lightening a ship gradually, and at the same time\npreserving the direction of her keel, or the angle which the keel\nmakes with the surface of the water, a variety of water-lines may be\ndrawn parallel to each other, and to the load-water-line See a farther\nillustration of these lines in the article Water-Line See also their\nfigure on a ship’s bottom, plate I fig 5",
    "5 The ribbands are likewise of great utility in ship-building; they are\nnarrow and flexible planks placed on the bottom at different heights,\nso as to form a sort of mould for stationing the inferior timbers\nbetween the principal ones They differ from the water-lines,\ninasmuch as the latter have only one curve, which is horizontal,\nwhereas the ribbands, besides their horizontal one, have a vertical\ncurve To convey a just idea of these curves, which cannot be\nrepresented on one draught at their full length, without an oblique\nsection of the ship’s length, it will be necessary to have recourse to\ntwo planes; that of the elevation, which exhibits their vertical curve;\nand to the floor-plane, upon which the horizontal curve is expressed See Ribbands These different lines are extremely useful in exhibiting the various\n\n\ncurves of a ship’s bottom, that as they are gradually diminished, their\nuniformity or irregularity may be discovered by the skilful artist We have already observed, that the qualities required in a ship\nought to determine the figure of the bottom: a ship of war therefore\nshould be able to sail swiftly, and carry her lower tier of guns\nsufficiently out of the water A merchant-ship ought to contain a large\ncargo of merchant-goods, and be navigated with few hands; and both\nshould be able to carry sail firmly; steer well; drive little to leeward;\nand sustain the shocks of the sea without being violently strained The first thing to be established in the draught of a ship is her\nlength; and as a ship of war, according to her rate, is furnished with a\ncertain number of cannon, which are placed in battery on her decks, it\nis necessary that a sufficient distance should be left between their\nports to work the guns with facility, and particularly to leave space\nenough between the foremost gun and the stem, and between the\naftmost gun and the stern-post on each side, on account of the\narching, or inward curve of the ship towards her extremities When the length of a ship is determined, it is usual to fix her\nbreadth by the dimensions of the midship-beam On this occasion the\nshipwrights, for the most part, are conducted by rules founded on\ntheir own observation; for having remarked, that some vessels which\nby repeated experience have been found to answer all the purposes of\nnavigation, have a certain breadth in proportion to their length, they\nhave inferred that it would be improper to depart from this\nproportion: but as other ships have been constructed with different\nbreadths, which were equally perfect, a variety of different general\nrules have been adopted by these artists, who are accordingly divided\nin their opinions about the breadth which ought to be assigned to a\nship relatively with her length, whilst each one produces reasons and\nexperience in support of his own standard Those who would diminish\nthe breadth alledge, that a narrow vessel meets with less resistance in\npassing through the water; 2dly That by increasing the length she\nwill drive less to leeward; 3dly That according to this principle, the\nwater-lines will be more conveniently formed to divide the fluid;\n4thly That a long and narrow ship will require less sail to advance\nswiftly; that her masts will be lower, and her rigging lighter; and, by\nconsequence, the seamen less fatigued with managing the sails, &c Those, on the contrary, who would enlarge the breadth, pretend,\n1st That this form is better fitted to preserve a good battery of guns 2dly That there will be more room to work the guns conveniently 3dly That by carrying more sail the ship will be enabled to run faster;\nor, that this quality will at least overbalance the advantage which the\nothers have of more easily dividing the fluid 4thly That, being\nbroader at the load-water-line, or place where the surface of the water\ndescribes a line round the bottom, they will admit of being very\nnarrow on the floor, particularly towards the extremities: and 5thly That a broad vessel will more readily rise upon the waves than a\nnarrow one From such opposite principles has resulted that variety of standards\nadopted by different shipwrights; and a servile imitation of these\nmechanical methods has, to the great reproach of the art, produced all\nthese pretended rules of proportion: for the various models they have\nhitherto adopted indisputably prove their doubt and uncertainty with\nregard to their proper standard Hence these pretended mysteries\nwhich are only to be revealed to such as are initiated into the craft Hence this division of the art into classes, or, according to the\ntechnical term, into families, each of which affects, with becoming\nsolemnity, to be possessed of the true secret, in preference to all the\nothers And hence violence of opposition, and mutual contempt\namongst the artists Indeed nothing appears more effectually to have\nretarded the progress of naval architecture, than the involving it in\nmysteries which the professors would gravely insinuate are only\nintelligible to themselves This ridiculous affectation is nevertheless\ntenaciously retained, notwithstanding the example to the contrary of\nsome of the most able shipwrights in Europe, who are real masters of\nthe theory of their art, and do honour to their profession, and who are\njustly exempted from the censure to which the others are often\nexposed It is not to be expected that an art so complicated and various,\ncomprehending such a diversity of structures, can be treated at large\nin a work of this sort To enter into a particular detail of the theory\nand practice; to explain the different parts with sufficient accuracy\nand perspicuity, would of itself require a large volume, and, by\nconsequence, greatly exceed the limits of our design Being thus\nnecessitated to contract our description into a narrow compass, it will\nbe sufficient to give a general idea of the subject; to describe the\nprincipal pieces of which a ship is composed, and to explain the\nprincipal draughts used in the construction thereof As the several lines exhibited in the planes of elevation, projection,\n&c will be rendered more intelligible by a previous account of those\n\n\npieces, it may not be improper to begin with reciting their names, and\ngiving a summary description of their uses and stations They are for\nthe most part represented according to the order of their disposition\nin that part of plate I which is termed Pieces of the Hull A The pieces which compose the keel, to be securely bolted\ntogether, and clinched B The stern-post, which is tenanted into the keel, and connected to\nit by a knee, G It supports the rudder, and unites the sides of the ship\nabaft C The stem, which is composed of two pieces scarfed together: it is\nan arching piece of timber, into which the ship’s sides are united\nforwards D",

and from these dimensions the\nshipwright is to form a draught suitable to the trade for which the\nship is designed In projecting the draught of a vessel of war, the first article to be\nconsidered is her length As all ships are much longer above than\nbelow, it is also necessary to distinguish the precise part of her height\nfrom which her length is taken: this is usually the lower gun-deck, or\nthe load water-line It has been already observed, that water-lines are\ndescribed longitudinally on a ship’s bottom by the surface of the water\nin which she floats, and that the line which determines her depth\nunder the water is usually termed the load-water-line In this draught\nit will be particularly necessary to leave sufficient distance between\nthe ports The next object is to establish the breadth by the midship-beam Although there is great difference of opinion about proportioning the\nbreadth to the length, yet it is most usual to conform to the\ndimensions of ships of the same rate After the dimensions of the\nbreadth and length are determined, the depth of the hold must be\nfixed, which is generally half the breadth: but the form of the body\nshould be considered on this occasion; for a flat floor will require less\ndepth in the hold than a sharp one The distance between the decks\nmust also be settled We may then proceed to fix the length of the keel, by which we\nshall be enabled to judge of the rake of the stem and stern-post The\nrake is known to be the projection of the ship at the height of the\nstem and stern-post, beyond the ends of the keel afore and abaft; or\nthe angle by which the length is increased as the fabric rises To these\nwe may also add the height of the stem and wing transom After these dimensions are settled, the timbers may be considered\nwhich form the sides of the ship A frame of timbers, which appears to\nbe one continued piece, is composed of one floor-timber, U, whose\narms branch outward to both sides of the ship; (See plate I Pieces of\nthe Hull) two or three futtocks V V, and a top-timber, W The futtocks\nare connected to the upper arms of the floor-timbers on each side of\nthe ship, and serve to prolong the timber in a vertical direction: and\nthe top-timbers are placed at the upper part of the futtocks for the\nsame purpose All these being united, and secured by cross-bars, form\na circular enclosure, which is called a frame of timbers, couple d’un\nvaisseau And as a ship is much broader at the middle than at the\nextremities, the arms of the floor-timber will form a very obtuse angle\nat the extreme breadth; but this angle decreases in proportion to the\ndistance of the timbers from the midship-frame, so that the foremost\nand aftmost ones will form a very acute angle Floor-timbers of the\nlatter sort are usually called crutches Shipwrights differ extremely in determining the station of the\nmidship-frame; some placing it at the middle of the ship’s length, and\nothers further forward They who place it before the middle, alledge,\nthat if a ship is full forward, she will meet with no resistance after she\nhas opened a column of water; and that the water so displaced will\neasily unite abaft, and by that means force the ship forward; besides\nhaving more power on the rudder, in proportion to its distance from\nthe center of gravity: this also comes nearer the form of fishes, which\nshould seem the most advantageous for dividing the fluid When the rising of the midship-floor-timber is decided, we may\n\n\nthen proceed to describe the rising-line of the floor, on the stern-post\nabaft, and on the stem afore The height of the lower-deck is the next thing to be considered: it is\ndetermined in the middle by the depth of the hold; and some builders\nmake it no higher than the stem; but they raise it abaft as much above\nits height in the middle, as the load-water-mark, or draught of water\nabaft, exceeds that afore With regard to the height between decks, it\nis altogether arbitrary, and must be determined by the rate of the\nship, and the service she is designed for It is also necessary to remember the sheer of the wales, and to give\nthem a proper hanging; because the beauty and stateliness of a ship\ngreatly depend upon their figure and curve, which, if properly drawn,\nwill, make her appear airy and graceful on the water We come now to consider the upper-works, and all that is above\nwater, called the dead-work: and here the ship must be narrower, so\nthat all the weight lying above the load-water-line will thereby be\nbrought nearer the middle of the breadth, and of course the ship will\nbe less strained by the working of her guns, &c But although some\nadvantages are acquired by diminishing the breadth above water, we\nmust be careful not to narrow her too much; as there must be\nsufficient room left on the upper-deck for the guns to recoil The\nsecurity of the masts should likewise be remembered, which requires\nsufficient breadth to spread the shrouds A deficiency of this sort may\nindeed be in some measure supplied by enlarging the breadth of the\nchannels With regard to the qualities required in the construction of a ship,\nto fit her for the various purposes of navigation, the reader is referred\nto the article Bottom We shall now proceed to explain the sheer draught, or plane of\nelevation, of a sixty gun ship; wherein we have been attentive to make\nthe same letters refer to the same objects, as in the explanation of the\nPieces, as above; at least when the same objects are in both figures; a\nconduct we shall invariably pursue throughout this work, although it\nseems to have been forgot by our predecessors Thus in all the plates\nof ship-building, the keel, whether separate or joined, is represented\nby A, the stern-post by B, the stem by C, the beams by D;

and the real height of the timbers in the projection,\nexactly conforms to their height in the elevation Thus let it be\nrequired to transfer the height of the wing-transom from the elevation\nto the projection:\nExtend the compasses from the point K, in the elevation, down to\nthe dotted line prolonged from the upper-edge of the keel, and setting\nthe other foot in the point p, then shall the line K p be the\nperpendicular height of the wing transom: transfer this from the\nmiddle of the line B A C, in the projection, to the point K in the\nperpendicular A F, then will A K be the height of the wing-transom in\nthe plane of projection: and thus the height of all the transoms may be\nlaid from the former upon the latter Again, let it be required to transfer the main-breadth of the\nmidship-frame from the projection to the horizontal plane: Set one\nfoot of the compasses in the point ⊕ on the perpendicular C E, and\nextend the other along the main-breadth-sweep ⊕ G, till it touches the\nperpendicular A F parallel to C E: lay this distance upon the\nhorizontal plane from the point u in the line of the ship’s length, B A\nC, along the plane of the midship-frame to the point ⊕; so shall the\nline ⊕ W U be the breadth of the midship-frame on the horizontal\nplane Thus also the top-timber-breadth, or the distance of each top-timber\nfrom the middle of the ship’s breadth, may be in the same manner\ntransferred, by extending the compasses from the line B A C, in the\nhorizontal plane, to the top-timber breadth-line, upon any particular\ntimber, as 1, 2, 3, &c which will give its proper dimensions thereon In the same manner the breadths of all the timbers may be laid\nfrom the projection to the horizontal plane, and vice versa, from that\n\n\nto the projection Thus the height of each timber may also be\ntransferred from the elevation to the projection, &c The principal utility of these draughts therefore is to exhibit the\nvarious curves of the ship’s body, and of the pieces of which it is\nframed, in different points of view, which are either transverse or\nlongitudinal, and will accordingly present them in very different\ndirections Thus the horizontal curves of the transoms and water-lines\nare represented on the floor-plane, all of which are nearly streight\nlines in the elevation and projection; and thus the vertical curves of\nthe timbers are all exhibited on the projection, although they appear\nas streight lines in the elevation and floor plane Before this article is closed, it may be necessary to remark, that the\nvarious pieces represented in plate I as well as the lines in the\ndraughts which have not been already defined, are copiously\nexplained in their proper places; as it would have been contrary to the\nplan of this work to have given a more enlarged description of them\nhere That the reader, however, might be better enabled to comprehend\nthe scope of this article, it was judged necessary to give a general\nsketch of naval architecture itself; to collect into one point of view the\nmost material draughts by which a ship is constructed, and to\ndescribe, as concisely as possible, the several parts of which they are\ncomposed The principal parts of a ship also, which are here reduced into a\nnarrow compass, will be represented at large in different places of this\nwork, to illustrate those explanations whither it may be necessary to\nrefer, in order to understand the subject more clearly Thus the stern,\nthe quarter, the midship-frame, the bow and head, of a ship of 74\nguns, are exhibited on a scale of ¼ of an inch to a foot; by which all\nthe subordinate parts may be distinctly viewed, and their combination\nand arrangement sufficiently understood ARMED-SHIP, vaisseau armé en guerre, a vessel occasionally taken\ninto the service of the government in time of war, and employed to\nguard some particular coast, or attend on a fleet She is therefore\narmed and equipped in all respects like a ship of war, and\ncommanded by an officer of the navy, who has the rank of master and\ncommander All ships of this sort are upon the establishment of the\nking’s sloops, having a lieutenant, master, purser, surgeon, &c ASHORE, (from a and shore) on the shore, or land, as opposed to\naboard A ship is said to be Ashore, echoué, when she has run upon the\nground, or on the sea-coast, either by design or accident ASTERN, au derriere, (from a and steorn, Sax ) any distance behind a\nship, as opposed to a-head, which is before her Thus, when south is a-\nhead, or on the line to which the stem is directed, north will be astern ATHWART, par le travers, (from a and twert, Dan transverse) when\nused in navigation, implies across the line of the course;

which may be easily estimated into\nsmaller parts if necessary The divisions are determined by means of a\ncat-gut line stretched perpendicularly with the box, as near the brass\nedge as may be, that the parallax arising from a different position of\nthe observer may be as little as possible There is also added an index at the top of the inner-box, which may\nbe fixed on or taken off at pleasure, and serves for all altitudes of the\nobject It consists of a bar, equal in length to the diameter of the\ninner-box, each end being furnished with a perpendicular stile, with a\nslit parallel to the sides thereof; one of the slits is narrow, to which\nthe eye is applied, and the other is wider, with a small cat-gut\nstretched up the middle of it, and from thence continued horizontally\nfrom the top of one stile to the top of the other There is also a line\ndrawn along the upper surface of the bar These four, viz the narrow\nslit, the horizontal cat-gut thread, the perpendicular one, and the line\non the bar, are in the same plane, which disposes itself\nperpendicularly to the horizon when the inner-box is at rest and hangs\nfree This index does not move round, but is always placed on, so as to\nanswer the same side of the box The sun’s azimuth is known to be an angle contained between the\nmeridian and the center of the sun When this is required, and his rays\nare strong enough to cast a shadow, the box is turned about till the\nshadow of the horizontal thread, or if the sun be too low, till that of\nthe perpendicular thread, in one stile, or the slit through the other,\nfalls upon the line in the index bar, or vibrates to an equal distance on\neach side of it, the box being gently touched if it vibrates too far: at\nthe same time they observe the degree marked upon the brass edge of\nthe cat-gut line In counting the degree for the azimuth, or any other\nangle that is reckoned from the meridian, the outward circle of figures\nupon the brass edge is used;

the intent of the former being to sustain the top-mast\nwhen the force of the wind acts upon the ship sideways, or, according\nto the sea-phrase, when the ship sails upon a wind; and the purpose of\nthe latter is to enable it to carry sail when the wind is further aft There are also back-stays for the top-gallant-masts, in large ships,\nwhich are fixed in the same manner with those of the top-masts A pair of back-stays is usually formed of one rope, which is doubled\nin the middle, and fastened there so as to form an eye, which passes\nover the mast-head, from whence the two ends hang down, and are\n\n\nstretched to the channels by dead-eyes and laniards See Dead-eyes,\n&c The figure of the back-stays, and their position, is exhibited in the\narticle Rigging, to which the reader is further referred BADGE, bouteille, fausse galerie, in ship-building, a sort of ornament,\nplaced on the outside of small ships, very near the stern, containing\neither a window, for the convenience of the cabin, or the\nrepresentation of it: it is commonly decorated with marine figures,\nmartial instruments, or such like emblems See Quarter To BALANCE, (balancer, Fr ) to contract a sail into a narrower\ncompass, in a storm, by retrenching or folding up a part of it at one\ncorner; this method is used in contradistinction to reefing, which is\ncommon to all the principal sails; whereas balancing is peculiar to\nfew, such as the mizen of a ship, and the main-sail of those vessels,\nwherein it is extended by a boom See Boom and Reef The Balance of the mizen, fanon, is thus performed: the mizen-\nyard is lowered a little, then a small portion of the sail is rolled up at\nthe peek, or upper corner, and fastened to the yard about one fifth\ninward from the outer end, or yard-arm, toward the mast See Mizen",
    "See Mizen A boom-main-sail is balanced, after all its reefs are taken in, by\nrolling up a similar portion of the hindmost, or aftmost lower-corner,\ncalled the clue, and fastening it strongly to the boom, having\npreviously wrapped a piece of old canvas round the part (which is\ndone in both cases) to prevent the sail from being fretted by the cord\nwhich fastens it BALLAST, lest, (ballaste, Dut ballastro, Span ) a certain portion of\nstone, iron, gravel, or such like materials, deposited in a ship’s hold,\nwhen she has either no cargo, or too little to bring her sufficiently low\nin the water It is used to counter-ballance the effort of the wind upon\nthe masts, and give the ship a proper stability, that she may be\nenabled to carry sail without danger of over-turning There is often great difference in the proportion of ballast required\nto prepare ships of equal burthen for a voyage; the quantity being\nalways more or less, according to the sharpness or flatness of the\nship’s bottom, which seamen call the floor The knowledge of ballasting a ship with propriety, is certainly an\narticle that deserves the attention of the skilful mariner; for although\nit is known that ships in general will not carry a sufficient quantity of\nsail, till they are laden so deep that the surface of the water will\nnearly glance on the extreme breadth amidships; yet there is more\n\n\nthan this general knowledge required; since, if she has a great weight\nof heavy ballast, as lead, iron, &c in the bottom, it will place the\ncenter of gravity too low in the hold; and although this will enable\nher to carry a great sail, she will nevertheless sail very heavily, and\nrun the risk of being dismasted by her violent rolling To ballast a ship, therefore, is the art of disposing those materials so\nthat she may be duly poised, and maintain a proper equilibrium on\nthe water, so as neither to be too stiff, nor too crank, qualities equally\npernicious; as in the first, although the ship may be fitted to carry a\ngreat sail, yet her velocity will not be proportionably increased; whilst\nher masts are more endangered by her sudden jerks and excessive\nlabouring: and in the last, she will be incapable of carrying sail,\nwithout the risk of oversetting Stiffness in ballasting, is occasioned by disposing a great quantity of\nheavy ballast, as lead, iron, &c in the bottom, which naturally places\nthe center of gravity very near the keel; and that being the center\nabout which the vibrations are made, the lower it is placed, the more\nviolent will be the motion of rolling Crankness, on the other hand, is occasioned by having too little\nballast, or by disposing the ship’s lading so as to raise the center of\ngravity too high, which also endangers the mast in carrying sail when\nit blows hard: for when the masts lose their perpendicular height, they\nstrain on the shrouds in the nature of a lever, which encreases as the\nsine of their obliquity; and a ship that loses her masts is in great\ndanger of being lost The whole art of ballasting, therefore, consists in placing the center\nof gravity to correspond with the trim and shape of the vessel, so as\nneither to be too high nor too low; neither too far forward, nor too far\naft; and to lade the ship so deep, that the surface of the water may\nnearly rise to the extreme breadth amidships; and thus she will be\nenabled to carry a good sail, incline but little, and ply well to the\nwindward See the article Trim BANIAN-Days, a cant term among common sailors, denoting those\ndays on which they have no flesh-meat: it seems to be derived from\nthe practice of a nation amongst the eastern Indians, who never eat\nflesh BANK, banc, atterrissement, (banc, Sax ) an elevation of the ground,\nor bottom of the sea, which is often so high as to appear above the\nsurface of the water, or at least so little beneath it, as to prevent a\nship from floating over it: in this sense, bank amounts nearly to the\n\n\nsame as shallows, flats, &c The shelves that abound with rocks under\nwater, are distinguished by other names, as reefs, ridges, keys, &c An exact knowledge of the banks, their extent, and the different\ndepths of water in which they lie, constitutes a very essential portion\nof the science of a pilot, or master of a ship If the vessel be large, and\ndraws much water, great attention will be necessary to avoid them If,\non the contrary, she is small, the same banks afford a sure asylum,\nwhere she may brave the largest ships, which dare not follow her to\nso dangerous a retreat Many small vessels have eluded the pursuit of\na superior enemy by means of this hospitable barrier Banks on the sea-coast are usually marked by beacons or buoys In\ncharts they are distinguished by little dots, as ridges of rocks are\ncharacterised by crosses The principal banks in the Western Ocean,\nare those of Newfoundland, and the Bahama-Bank: the most\nremarkable one in Newfoundland is called the Grand Bank, which is\nof a vast extent, being nearly two hundred miles in length, and\nstretching north and south: its usual depth is from twenty to eighty\nfathoms: and this is the great scene of the cod-fishery, which is so\nmaterial an article in European commerce Bank of oars, a seat or bench of rowers in a galley BANKER, a vessel employed in the cod-fishery on the Banks of\nNewfoundland BAR of a port or haven, a shoal or bank of sand, gravel, &c thrown\nup by the surge of the sea, to the mouth of a river or harbour, so as to\nendanger, and sometimes totally prevent the navigation BARCA-LONGA, a large Spanish fishing-boat, navigated with lug-\nsails, and having two or three masts: these are very common in the\nMediterranean See Vessel BARGE (bargie, Dutch) a vessel or boat of state, furnished with\nelegant apartments, canopies, and cushions;

sharp or flat-bottomed;\nopen or decked; plain or ornamented; as they may be designed for\nswiftness or burthen; for deep or shallow water; for sailing in a\nharbour or at sea; and for convenience, or pleasure The largest boat that usually accompanies a ship is the long-boat,\nchaloupe, which is generally furnished with a mast and sails: those\nwhich are fitted for men of war, may be occasionally decked, armed,\nand equipped, for cruising short distances against merchant-ships of\nthe enemy, or smugglers, or for impressing seamen, &c The barges are next in order, which are longer, slighter, and\nnarrower: they are employed to carry the principal sea-officers, as\nadmirals, and captains of ships of war, and are very unfit for sea See\nthe article Barge Pinnaces exactly resemble barges, only that they are somewhat\nsmaller, and never row more than eight oars; whereas a barge\nproperly never rows less than ten These are for the accommodation of\nthe lieutenants, &c Cutters of a ship, bateaux, are broader, deeper, and shorter than the\nbarges and pinnaces; they are fitter for sailing, and are commonly\nemployed in carrying stores, provisions, passengers, &c to and from\nthe ship In the structure of this sort of boats, the lower-edge of every\nplank in the side over-lays the upper-edge of the plank below, which\nis called by shipwrights clinch-work Yawls, canots, are something less than cutters, nearly of the same\nform, and used for similar services; they are generally rowed with six\noars The above boats more particularly belong to men of war; as\nmerchant-ships seldom have more than two, viz a long-boat and\nyawl: when they have a third, it is generally calculated for the\ncountries to which they trade, and varies in its construction\naccordingly Merchant-ships employed in the Mediterranean find it more\nconvenient to use a lanch, which is longer, more flat-bottomed, and\nbetter adapted every way to the harbours of that sea than a long-boat See Lanch A wherry, diligence, is a light sharp boat, used in a river or harbour\nfor carrying passengers from place to place Punts, flette, are a sort of oblong flat-bottomed boats, nearly\nresembling floating stages;

and that the sails\nare properly fitted to their yards and stays, and well furled or reefed\nwhen occasion requires It is likewise his office to summon the crew to their duty; to assist\nwith his mates in the necessary business of the ship; and to relieve the\nwatch when it expires He ought frequently to examine the condition\nof the masts, sails, and rigging, and remove whatever may be judged\nunfit for service, or supply what is deficient: and he is ordered by his\ninstructions to perform this duty with as little noise as possible BOB-STAY, sous-barbe, a rope used to confine the bowsprit of a ship\ndownward to the stem, or cut-water It is fixed by thrusting one of its\nends through a hole bored in the fore-part of the cut-water for this\npurpose, and then splicing both ends together so as to make it two-\nfold, or like the link of a chain: a dead-eye is then seized into it, and a\nlaniard passing through this and communicating with another dead-\neye upon the bowsprit, is drawn extremely tight by the help of\nmechanical powers See Bowsprit The use of the bob-stay, is to draw down the bowsprit, and keep it\nsteddy; and to counter-act the force of the stays of the fore-mast,\nwhich draw it upwards The bowsprit is also fortified by shrouds from\nthe bows on each side; which are all very necessary, as the foremast\n\n\nand the upper-part of the main-mast are stayed and greatly supported\nby the bowsprit For this reason, the bob-stay is the first part of a\nship’s rigging which is drawn tight to support the masts To perform\nthis task more effectually, it is usual to suspend a boat, anchor, or\nother weighty body, at the bowsprit-end, to press it downwards\nduring this operation BOLSTERS, a sort of small cushions or bags, filled with tarred\ncanvas, laid between the collars of the stays and the edge of some\npiece of wood on which they lie: they are used to preserve the stays\nfrom being chafed or galled by the motion of the masts, as the ship\nrocks or pitches at sea BOLT-ROPE, ralingue, a rope to which the edges or skirts of the sails\nare sewed, to strengthen, and prevent them from rending Those parts\nof the bolt-rope which are on the perpendicular or sloping edges, are\ncalled leech-ropes; that at the bottom, the foot-rope; and that on the\ntop or upper edge, the head-rope Stay-sails, whose heads are formed\nlike an acute angle, have no head-rope To different parts of the bolt-\nrope are fastened all the ropes employed to contract or dilate the sails The figure and position of the bolt-rope is exhibited in the plate\nreferred to from the article Sail",

as the jib-boom, studding-sail-booms, ring-tail-\nboom, driver-boom, main-boom, and square-sail-boom; the two last,\nhowever, are only appropriated to small ships of one or two masts See Jib, &c BOOT-TOPPING, the act of cleaning the upper-part of a ship’s\nbottom, or that part which lies immediately under the surface of the\n\n\nwater, and daubing it over with tallow, or with a coat or mixture of\ntallow, sulphur, resin, &c Boot-topping is chiefly performed where there is no dock, or\nother commodious situation for breaming or careening; or when the\nhurry of a voyage renders it inconvenient to have the whole bottom\nproperly trimmed and cleansed of the filth which gathers to it in the\ncourse of a sea-voyage It is executed by making the ship lean to one\nside, as much as they can with safety, and then scraping off the grass,\nslime, shells, or other material, that adheres to the bottom, on the\nother side, which is elevated above the surface of the water for this\npurpose, and accordingly daubed with the coat of tallow and sulphur Having thus finished one side, they make the ship lean to the other\nside, and perform the same operation, which not only preserves the\nbottom from the worm, but makes the ship slide smoothly through the\nwater See Careen and Dock BORE See the article Cannon BOTH SHEETS AFT, entre deux écoutes, the situation of a ship that\nsails right afore the wind, or with the wind right astern BOTTOM, carene, (botm, Sax bodem, Belg ) as a sea-term, is either\nused to denote the bottom of a ship, or that of the water: thus in the\nformer sense we say, a clean or a foul bottom; a British, French, or\nDutch bottom: and in the latter sense, a rocky, sandy, or oozy bottom The bottom of a ship, as we have described in the article Naval\nArchitecture, comprehends all that part which is under water when\nthe ship is laden; the figure of it must therefore be determined by the\nqualities required in the ship, and the purposes for which the is\ndesigned It has been remarked, that a ship of war should carry her lowest tier\nof cannon sufficiently above the surface of the water to be used when\nnecessary If this quality is neglected, a small ship will have the\nadvantage of a large one, inasmuch as the latter cannot open her\nlower battery in a fresh side-wind, without being exposed to extreme\ndanger, by receiving a great quantity of water in at her ports between-\ndecks A ship should be duly poised, so as not to dive or pitch heavily, but\ngo smoothly and easily through the water, rising to the waves when\nthey run high, or when the vessel has reduced her sail to the storm If\nshe is deficient in this article, the seas will frequently burst aboard,\nand strain the decks or carry away the boats The masts are also\ngreatly endangered from the same cause A ship should sail well when large, or before the wind; but\nparticularly when close-hauled, or sailing with a side-wind She should\nalso be enabled in the latter situation to keep her wind, without\ndeviating much to leeward; to work and tack easily, and lie in a\nturbulent sea without straining violently Many of our shipwrights have considered it extremely difficult, if\nnot impracticable, to make a ship carry her cannon well, bear a\ncompetent sail, and advance swiftly through the water; because a very\nfull bottom is necessary to acquire the two first qualities; whereas a\nsharp floor is better fitted to procure the latter But when it is\nremembered, that a full ship will carry a much greater force of sail\nthan a sharp one, a good artist may form the body so as to unite all\nthese three qualities with the additional one of steering easily, by\npaying a proper attention to the following general rules To make a ship carry a good sail A flat floor-timber somewhat long,\n\n\nor the lower-futtocks pretty round, a streight upper-futtock, the top-\ntimber to throw out the breadth aloft; at any rate to carry the main-\nbreadth as high as the lower-deck Now if the rigging be well adapted\nto such a body, and the upper-works lightened as much as possible, so\nthat the whole contributes to lower the center of gravity, there will be\nno reason to doubt of the ship’s carrying a good sail To make a ship steer well, and answer the helm readily If the\nfashion-pieces be well formed, the tuck, or spreading-parts under the\nstern, carried pretty high; the midship-frame well forward; a\nconsiderable additional depth in the draught of water abaft more than\nforward; a great rake forward and none abaft; a snug quarter-deck and\nforecastle: all these will greatly facilitate the steerage; and a ship that\nsails well will always steer easily To make a ship carry her guns well out of the water A long floor-\ntimber, and not of great rising; a very full midship-frame, and low\ntuck, with light upper-works To make a ship go smoothly through the water, and prevent her\nfrom pitching heavily A long keel, a long floor, not to rise too high\nafore and abaft; but the area, or space contained in the fore-body,\naccording to the respective weight it is destined to carry: all these are\nnecessary to make a ship pass easily through the sea To make a ship keep a good wind and drive little to leeward A\ngood length by the keel; not too broad, but pretty deep in the hold,\nwhich will occasion her to have a short floor-timber and a very great\nrising As such a ship will meet with great resistance in driving\nsideways, and feel very little, in advancing or going ahead, she will\nfall very little to leeward Being thus furnished with the methods to qualify a ship for the\ndifferent purposes of navigation, the only difficulty remains to apply\nthem properly in the construction, which must, in a great measure, be\nleft to the judgment of the artist The whole art then is evidently to\nform the body in such a manner, as that none of these qualities shall\nbe entirely destroyed; and in giving the preference to that which is\nprincipally required in the service for which the ship is destined As it\ntherefore appears possible to unite them all in one vessel so that each\nof them may be easily discerned, a neglect of this circumstance ought\nto be attributed to the incapacity of the shipwright, who has not\nstudied the principles of his art with proper application See Naval\nArchitecture, Building, and Ship BOTTOMRY, bomerie, (from bottom) a contract for borrowing money\n\n\non the keel or bottom of a ship; so that the commander binds the ship\nherself, that if the money be not paid at the time appointed, the\ncreditors shall have the ship Bottomry is also where a person lends money to a merchant or\nadventurer who wants it in traffic, and the lender is to be paid a much\ngreater sum at the return of the ship, standing to the hazard of the\nvoyage Although the interest on this account be greater than the law\ncommonly allows, it is yet not esteemed usury; because the money\nbeing supplied at the lenders risk, if the ship perishes, he shares in the\nloss thereof BOW, epaule, in ship-building, the rounding part of a ship’s side\nforward, beginning at the place where the planks arch inwards, and\nterminated where they close at the stem or prow See the article Head,\nwhere the bow of a ship is represented at large It is proved by a\nvariety of experiments, that a ship with a narrow bow is much better\ncalculated for sailing swiftly, than one with a broad bow; but is not so\nwell fitted for a high sea, into which she always pitches, or plunges,\nher fore-part very deep, for want of sufficient breadth to repel the\nvolume of water, which she so easily divides in her fall The former of\nthese is called by seamen a lean, and the latter a bluff bow “The bow which meets with the least resistance in a direct course,\nnot only meets with the least resistance in oblique courses, but also\nhas the additional property of driving the least to leeward; which is a\ndouble advantage gained by forming the bow so as to give it that\nfigure which will be the least opposed in moving through any\nmedium ” Bouguer’s Traité du Navire On the Bow, in navigation, an arch of the horizon, comprehended\nbetween some distant object, and that point of the compass which is\nright-ahead, or to which the ship’s stem is directed This phrase is\nequally applicable, when the object is beheld from the ship, or\ndiscovered by trigonometrical calculation: as, we saw a fleet at day-\nbreak bearing three points on the starboard bow;

one of which resting across two\ncheeks or ears, in the upper-end of the pump, serves as a fulcrum for\nthe brake, supporting it between the cheeks The other bolt connects\nthe extremity of the brake to the pump-spear, which draws up the box\nor piston, charged with the water in the tube See the article Pump BREADTH, largeur, the measure of a ship from side to side in any\nparticular place: it is usually distinguished into extreme-breadth, ligne\ndu fort, main-breadth, and top-timber-breadth See the explanation of\nthe plane of projection, in the article Naval Architecture As the sides of the ship are formed by a variety of ribs, called\ntimbers, and the areas of those timbers being of different breadths\nabove and below, it is necessary to distinguish them in the\nconstruction, in order to form their several curves, and fix the\ncorresponding pieces with more accuracy and precision The part of\nevery timber which encloses the greatest space from the middle-line\nof the ship’s length, is therefore called the main-breadth; and the\ndistance between the upper-part of the same timber and the middle-\n\n\nline of the ship’s length, is called the top-timber-breadth As the ship is also broader at the midship-frame than in any other\npoint of her length, the distance between her sides in the main-\nbreadth of that timber, is called the extreme-breadth of the ship Breadth-sweep, the radius of the arch which forms part of the\ncurve of a ship’s timber; as explained in the horizontal plane See\nNaval Architecture BREAKERS, brisans, a name given by sailors to those billows that\nbreak violently over rocks lying under the surface of the sea They are\ndistinguished both by their appearance and sound, as they cover that\npart of the sea with a perpetual foam, and produce a hoarse and\nterrible roaring, very different from what the waves usually have in a\ndeeper bottom When a ship is unhappily driven amongst breakers, it is hardly\npossible to save her, as every billow that heaves her upwards, serves\nto dash her down with additional force, when it breaks over the rocks\nor sands beneath it BREAKING-BULK, the act of beginning to unlade a ship; or of\ndischarging the first part of the cargo To BREAK-UP, déchirer, to rip off the planks of a ship, and take her\nto pieces, when she becomes old and unserviceable BREAK-WATER, the hulk, or hull, of some old ship or vessel, sunk\nat the entrance of a small harbour, to break off, and diminish the\nforce of the waves, as they advance towards the vessels moored\nwithin Break-water is also a sort of small buoy, fastened to a large one in\nthe water, when the buoy-rope of the latter is not long enough to\nreach from the anchor, lying on the bottom, to the surface of the\nwater The use of this break-water is therefore to shew where the\nbuoy swims See Buoy To BREAM, chauffer (from broom) to burn off the filth, such as grass,\nooze, shells, or sea-weed, from a ship’s bottom, that has gathered to it\nin a voyage, or by lying long in a harbour This operation is\nperformed by holding kindled furze, faggots, or such materials, to the\nbottom, so that the flame incorporating with the pitch, sulphur, &c that had formerly covered it, immediately loosens and throws off\nwhatever filth may have adhered to the planks After this, the bottom\nis covered anew with a composition of sulphur, tallow, &c which not\nonly makes it smooth and slippery, so as to divide the fluid more\nreadily, but also poisons and destroys those worms which eat through\n\n\nthe planks in the course of a voyage Breaming may be performed\neither when the ship lies aground after the tide has ebbed from her,\nby docking, or by careening, which see;

that it is\nemployed to confine or keep steddy the windward or weather edges of\nthe principal sails when they are braced for a side-wind For as the\ncurrent of air enters the cavity of the sail in a direction nearly parallel\nto its surface, it follows that the ridge of the sail must necessarily be\nshaken by the wind, unless it is kept tight forward; but as a single\nrope has not been found sufficient to confine the whole skirt of the\nsail, inasmuch as it only draws upon one part thereof, it became\nnecessary to apply bridles or legs spreading out from the bowline They are represented in the figures annexed to the article Sail BRIG, or Brigantine, a merchant-ship with two masts This term is\nnot universally confined to vessels of a particular construction, or\nwhich are masted and rigged in a method different from all others It\n\n\nis variously applied, by the mariners of different European nations, to\na peculiar sort of vessel of their own marine Amongst English seamen, this vessel is distinguished by having her\nmain-sail set nearly in the plane of her keel; whereas the main-sails of\nlarger ships are hung athwart, or at right angles with the ship’s length,\nand fastened to a yard which hangs parallel to the deck: but in a brig,\nthe foremost edge of the main-sail is fastened in different places to\nhoops which encircle the main-mast, and slide up and down it as the\nsail is hoisted or lowered: it is extended by a gaff above, and by a\nboom below To BRING by the lee See To Broach-to To BRING-TO, in navigation, caposer, to check the course of a ship\nwhen she is advancing, by arranging the sails in such a manner as that\nthey shall counter-act each other, and prevent her either from\nretreating or moving forward In this situation the ship is said to lie-\nby, or lie-to, having, according to the sea-phrase, some of her sails\naback, to oppose the force of those which are full; or having them\notherwise shortened by being furled, or hauled up in the brails Bringing-to, is generally used to detain a ship in any particular\nstation, in order to wait the approach of some other that may be\nadvancing towards her: or to retard her course occasionally near any\nport in the course of a voyage To Bring-up, a provincial phrase peculiar to the seamen in the\ncoal-trade, signifying to anchor, &c To BROACH-TO, in navigation, to incline suddenly to windward of\nthe ship’s course when she sails with a large wind; or, when she sails\ndirectly before the wind, to deviate from the line of her course, either\nto the right or left, with such rapidity as to bring the ship’s side\nunexpectedly to windward, and expose her to the danger of\noversetting It is easy to conceive that a ship will carry much more sail before\nthe wind than when she makes a progress with her side to its\ndirection; because when the current of wind acts nearly endways on\nher hull, the pressure of it on the masts must be considerably\ndiminished as she yields to its impulse and flies before it; and that if\nshe carries a great sail at this time, it can only press her fore-part\nlower down in the water But if, when she carries a great extension of\nsail, her side is suddenly brought to the wind, it may be attended with\nthe most fatal consequences, as the whole force of it then pours like a\ntorrent into the cavities of the sails The masts therefore unavoidably\n\n\nyield to this strong impression, acting like levers on the ship sideways,\nso as nearly to overturn her, unless she is relieved by some other\nevent, which may be also extremely pernicious, such as the sails\nrending to pieces, or the masts being carried away It is generally occasioned by the difficulty of steering the ship; by\nthe negligence or incapacity of the helmsman; or by some disaster\nhappening to the helm or its machinery, which renders it incapable of\ngoverning the ship’s course The difference between broaching-to and bringing by the lee, may be\nthus defined Suppose a ship with a great sail set is steering south,\nhaving the wind N N W then is west the weather, and east the lee-side If by some deficiency in the steerage her head turns round to the\nwestward, so as that her sails are all taken aback on the weather-side\nbefore she can be made to return to the course from which she has\ndeviated, she is said to broach-to If otherwise her head, from the same cause, has declined so far\neastward as to lay her sails aback on that side which was the lee-side,\nit is called bringing her by the lee BROADSIDE, bordee, in a naval engagement, the whole discharge of\nthe artillery on one side of a ship of war above and below; as,\nWe poured a broadside into the enemy’s ship, i e discharged all\nthe ship’s cannon on one side upon her She brought her broadside to bear on the castle; that is, disposed\nthe ship so as to point all her cannon to it within point-blank range A squall of wind laid the ship on her broadside; that is, pressed her\ndown in the water, so as nearly to overturn her BROKEN-BACKED, arcqué, the state or quality of a ship, which is so\nloosened in her frame, either by age, weakness, or some great strain,\nas to droop at each end This circumstance is more common amongst French than the\nEnglish or Dutch ships, owing partly to their great length, and to the\nsharpness of the floor, whose breadth is not sufficiently carried from\nthe middle towards each end; and partly from being frequently\nobliged to have a great weight in both ends, when they are empty in\nthe middle, at the time of discharging one cargo and taking in\nanother See Cambering BUCCANEER, a name given to certain piratical rovers of various\nEuropean nations, who formerly infested the Spanish coasts in\nAmerica, and, under pretence of traffic with the inhabitants,\nfrequently seized their treasure, plundered their houses, and\n\n\ncommitted many other depredations Ship-BUILDING may be defined the manner of constructing ships, or\nthe work itself, as distinguished from naval architecture, which we\nhave rather considered as the theory or art of delineating ships on a\nplane, and to which this article may properly be understood as a\nsupplement The pieces by which this complicated machine is framed, are joined\ntogether in various places, by scarfing, rabitting, tenanting, and\nscoring See those articles During the construction of a ship, she is supported in the dock, or\nupon a wharf, by a number of solid blocks of timber placed at equal\ndistances from, and parallel to, each other, as may be seen in the\narticle Lanching; she is then said to be on the stocks The first piece of timber laid upon the blocks is generally the keel; I\nsay generally, because, of late, a different method has been adopted in\nsome of the royal dock-yards, by beginning with the floor-timbers; the\nartists having found that the keel is often apt to rot during the long\nperiod of building a large ship of war The pieces of the keel, as\nexhibited in plate I are scarfed together, and bolted, forming one\nentire piece, A A which constitutes the length of the vessel below At\none extremity of the keel is erected the stem It is a strong piece of\ntimber incurvated nearly into a circular arch, or, according to the\ntechnical term, compassing, so as to project outwards at the upper-end,\nforming what is called the rake forward In small vessels this is framed\nof one piece, but in large ships it is composed of several pieces scarfed\nand bolted together, as expressed in the explanation of plate I Pieces\nof the Hull, and in those terms separately At the other extremity of\nthe keel, is elevated the stern-post, which is always of one entire strait\npiece The heel of it is let into a mortise in the keel, and having its\nupper-end to hang outwards, making an obtuse angle with the keel,\nlike that of the stem: this projection is called the rake abaft The stern-\npost, which ought to support the stern, contains the iron-work or\nhinges of the rudder, which are called googings, and unites the lower-\npart of the ship’s sides abaft See the connexion of those pieces in the\nElevation, pl I Towards the upper-end of the stern-post, and at right angles with its\nlength, is fixed the middle of the wing-transom, where it is firmly\nbolted Under this is placed another piece parallel thereto, and called\nthe deck-transom, upon which the after-end of the lower-deck is\nsupported Parallel to the deck-transom, and at a proper distance\n\n\nunder it, another piece is fixed to the stern-post, called the first\ntransom, all of which serve to connect the stern-post to the fashion\npieces Two more transoms, called the second and third, are also\nplaced under these, being likewise attached to the fashion pieces, into\nwhich the extremities of all the transoms are let, as exhibited in plate\nX fig 1 The fashion-pieces are formed like the other timbers of the\nship, and have their heels resting on the upper-part of the kelson, at\nthe after extremity of the floor ribbands All these pieces, viz the transoms, the fashion-pieces, and their top-\ntimbers, being strongly united into one frame, are elevated upon the\nstern-post, and the whole forms the structure of the stern, upon which\nthe galleries and windows, with their ornaments, are afterwards built,\nThe stem and stern-post being thus elevated upon the keel, to which\nthey are securely connected by knees and arched pieces of timber\nbolted to both; and the keel being raised at its two extremities by\npieces of dead-wood, the midship floor-timber is placed across the keel,\nwhereto it is bolted through the middle The floor-timbers before and\nabaft the midship-frame are then stationed in their proper places upon\nthe keel; after which the kelson, which, like the keel, is composed of\nseveral pieces scarfed together, is fixed across the middle of the floor-\ntimbers, to which it is attached by bolts driven through the keel, and\nclinched on the upper-part of the kelson The futtocks are then raised\nupon the floor-timbers, and the hawse-pieces erected upon the cant-\ntimbers in the fore-part of the ship The top-timbers on each side are\nnext attached to the head of the futtocks, as already explained in the\narticle naval Architecture The frames of the principal timbers\nbeing thus completed, are supported by ribbands, as exhibited in the\nplate referred to from the article Ribbands The ribs of the ship being now stationed, they proceed to fix on the\nplanks, of which the wales are the principal, being much thicker and\nstronger than the rest; as is represented in the Midship-Frame The\nharpins, which may be considered as a continuation of the wales at\ntheir fore-ends, are fixed across the hawse-pieces, and surround the\nfore-part of the ship The planks that inclose the ship’s sides are then\nbrought about the timbers, and the clamps, which are of equal\nthickness with the wales, fixed opposite to the wales within the ship;\nthese are used to support the ends of the beams, and accordingly\nstretch from one end of the ship to the other The thick stuff, or strong\nplanks of the bottom within-board, are then placed opposite to the\nseveral scarfs of the timbers, to reinforce them throughout the ship’s\n\n\nlength The planks employed to line the ship, called the ceiling, or foot-\nwaling, is next fixed in the intervals between the thick-stuff of the\nhold The beams are afterwards laid across the ship to support the\ndecks, and are connected to the side by lodging and hanging knees;\nthe former of which are exhibited in their proper stations in plate III F and the hanging ones, together with the breadth, thickness, and\nposition of the keel, floor-timbers, futtocks, top timbers, wales,\nclamps, thick-stuff, planks within and without, beams, decks, &c are\nseen in the Midship-Frame The cable-bits being next erected, the carlings and ledges, which are\nrepresented in plate III and described in their proper places, are\ndisposed between the beams to strengthen the deck The water-ways\nare then laid on the ends of the beams throughout the ship’s length,\nand the spirketting fixed close above them The upper-deck is then\nplanked, and the string placed under the gunnel or plansheer in the\nwaist The disposition of those latter pieces on the timbers, viz the\nwater-ways, spirketting, upper-deck, string, and gunnel, are also\nrepresented in the Midship-Frame They proceed next to plank the quarter-deck and forecastle, and to\nfix the partners of the masts and capsterns with the coamings of the\nhatches The breast-hooks are then bolted across the stem and bow\nwithin-board, the step of the fore-mast placed on the kelson; and the\nriders, exhibited in the Midship-Frame, fayed on the inside of the\ntimbers to reinforce the sides in different places of the ship’s length The pointers, if any, are afterwards fixed across the hold diagonally to\nsupport the beams; and the crotches stationed in the after-hold to unite\nthe half-timbers The steps of the main-mast and capsterns are next\nplaced; the planks of the lower-decks and orlop laid; the navel hoods\nfayed on the hawse-holes; and the knee of the head, or cutwater,\nconnected to the stem The figure of the head is then erected, and the\ntrail-board and cheeks fixed on the sides of the knee The taffarel and quarter pieces, which terminate the ship abaft, the\nformer above, and the latter on each side, are then disposed; and the\nstern and quarter galleries framed and supported by their brackets The pumps, with their well, are next fixed in the hold; the limber-\nboards laid on each side of the kelson, and the garboard strake fixed on\nthe ship’s bottom next to the keel without The hull being thus fabricated, they proceed to separate the\napartments by bulk-heads, or partitions; to frame the port-lids; to fix\nthe catheads and chess-trees; to form the hatchways and scuttles, and fit\n\n\nthem with proper covers or gratings They next fix the ladders whereby\nto mount or descend the different hatchways, and build the manger on\nthe lower deck, to carry off the water that runs in at the hawse-holes\nwhen the ship rides at anchor in a sea The bread-room and magazines\nare then lined, and the gunnel, rails, and gangways, fixed on the upper\npart of the ship The cleats, kevels, and ranges, by which the ropes are fastened, are afterwards bolted or nailed to the sides in different\nplaces The rudder, being fitted with its irons, is next hung to the stern-post;\nand the tiller, or bar, by which it is managed, let into a mortise at its\nupper-end The scuppers, or leaden tubes, that carry the water off from\nthe decks, are then placed in holes cut through the ship’s sides; and\nthe standards, represented in the Midship-Frame, bolted to the beams\nand sides above the decks to which they belong The poop-lanthorns\nare last fixed upon their cranes over the stern, and the bilge-ways, or\ncradles, placed under the bottom, to conduct the ship steadily into the\nwater whilst lanching As the various pieces, which have been mentioned above, are\nexplained at large in their proper places, with references to their\nfigures according to the plan of this work, it would have been\nsuperfluous to have entered into a more particular description of them\nhere It is perhaps necessary to observe, that as the theory ought\nalways to precede the practice, this article would probably be much\nbetter understood by previously reading that of Naval Architecture,\nwhich may be considered as a proper introduction to it BUILT, fabrique, the particular form or structure of a ship, by which\nshe is distinguished from others of a different class or nation Thus a\nship is said to be frigate-built, galley-built, a hag-boat, a pink, a cat,\n&c or to be English-built, French-built, American-built, &c BULK-HEADS, certain partitions, or walls, built up in several places\nof a ship between two decks, either lengthwise or across, to form and\nseparate the various apartments Some of those which are built across\nthe ship are remarkably strong See the article Close-Quarters BULL’S-EYE, cosse a sort of small pulley in the form of a ring,\nhaving a rope spliced round the outer edge of it, (which is hollowed\nto admit of the rope) and a large hole in the middle for another rope\nto slide in It is seldom used but for the main and fore bowline-bridles\nof some ships, particularly the colliers of Northumberland, &c It is\nspliced in the outer-end of the bowline, and sliding along the bridle,\nto rest in the most apposite place, draws it tight above and below This implement is more frequently used by Dutch than English\nseamen BUMKIN, or Boomkin, boute-lof, a short boom or bar of timber,\nprojecting from each bow of a ship, to extend the lower-edge of the\nfore-sail to windward; for which purpose there is a large block fixed\non its outer end, through which the rope is passed that is fastened to\nthe lower-corner of the sail to windward, called the tack; and this\nbeing drawn tight down, brings the corner of the sail close to the\nblock, which being performed, the tack is said to be aboard The bumkin is secured by a strong rope which confines it\ndownward to the ship’s bow, to counter-act the strain it bears from\nthe fore-sail above, dragging it upwards BUNT, the middle part, or cavity of the principal square sails, as the\nmain-sail, fore-sail, top-sails, and top-gallant-sails If one of those sails\nis supposed to be divided into four equal parts, from one side to the\nother, then may the two middle divisions, which comprehend half of\nthe sail, be properly called the limits of the bunt BUNTINE, etamine, a thin woollen stuff, of which the colours and\nsignals of a ship are usually formed BUNTLINES, cargues fond, are ropes fastened to the bottoms of the\nsquare sails, to draw them up to the yards: they are inserted through\ncertain blocks above, or on the upper-part of the yard, whence passing\ndown-wards on the fore-part of the sail, they are fastened below to the\nlower-edge in several places of the bolt-rope BUOY, (bouée, Fr ) a sort of close cask, or block of wood, fastened\nby a rope to the anchor, to determine the place where the anchor is\nsituated, that the ship may not come too near it, to entangle her cable\nabout the stock, or the flukes of it Buoys are of various kinds; as,\nCan-Buoys; these are in the form of a cone, (see plate II fig 8 ) and\nof this construction are all the buoys which are floated over\ndangerous banks and shallows, as a warning to passing ships, that\nthey may avoid them They are extremely large, that they may be seen\nat a distance, and are fastened by strong chains to the anchors which\nare sunk for this purpose at such places Nun-Buoys, are shaped like the middle frustum of two cones,\nabutting upon one common base, (plate II fig 9 ) being casks, which\nare large in the middle, and tapering, nearly to a point, at each end Wooden Buoys, are solid pieces of timber, sometimes in the shape\nof a cylinder, and sometimes of a nun-buoy; they are furnished with\n\n\none or two holes, in which to fix a short piece of rope, whose two\nends being spliced together make a sort of circle or ring called the\nstrop Cable-Buoys, common casks employed to buoy up the cable in\ndifferent places from any rocky ground In the harbour of Alexandria,\nin Egypt, every ship is moored with at least three cables, and has\nthree or four of these buoys on each cable for this purpose BUOY-ROPE, the rope which fastens the buoy to the anchor: it\nshould be little more than equal in length to the depth of the water\nwhere the anchor lies, as it is intended to float near, or immediately\nabove the bed of it, that the pilot may at all times know the situation\nthereof See plate I fig 6 b is the anchor, c the buoy-rope, and d the\nbuoy floating on the surface of the water The Buoy-Rope is often extremely useful otherways, in drawing up\nthe anchor when the cable is broke It should therefore be always of\nsufficient strength for this purpose, or else the anchor may be lost\nthrough negligence Slings of the Buoy, the ropes which are fastened about it, and by\nwhich it is hung: they are curiously spliced round it, something\nresembling the braces of a drum To stream the Buoy, is to let it fall from the ship’s side into the\nwater, which is always done before they let go the anchor, that it may\nnot be retarded by the buoy-rope as it sinks to the bottom BURTHEN, or Burden, port, (byrthen, Sax ) the weight or measure\nof any species of merchandize that a ship will carry when fit for sea To determine the burthen, or, in other words, the tonnage, of a\nship, it is usual to multiply the length of the keel into the extreme\nbreadth of the ship within-board, taken along the midship-beam, and\nmultiply the product by the depth in the hold from the plank joining\nto the kelson upwards, to the main-deck, and divide the last product\nby 94, then will the quotient be the burden required, in tons BURTON, bredindin, a sort of small tackle, formed by two blocks or\npullies, till the rope becomes three or four fold, and acquires an\nadditional power in proportion It is generally employed to tighten the shrouds of the top-masts, but\nmay be otherways used to move or draw along any weighty body in\nthe hold, or on the deck, as anchors, bales of goods, large casks, &c BUSS, buche, (busse, Germ ) a ship of two masts, used by the English\nand Dutch in their herring fisheries It is generally from fifty to\nseventy tons burthen; being furnished with two small sheds or cabins,\n\n\none at the prow and the other at the stern; the former of which is\nemployed as a kitchen BUTT, about, the end of any plank in a ship’s side which unites with\nthe end of another, continuing its length: when a plank is loosened at\nthe end by the ship’s weakness or labouring, she is said to have\nstarted or sprung a butt BUTTOCK, the convexity of a ship behind, under the stern; it is\nterminated by the counter above, and by the after part of the bilge\nbelow, by the rudder in the middle, and by the quarter on the side BUTTONS See the article Bonnet C CABIN, cabane, a room or apartment in a ship where any of the\nofficers usually reside There are many of these in a large ship; the principal of which is\ndesigned for the captain, or commander In ships of the line, this\nchamber is furnished with an open gallery in the ships stern, as also a\nlittle gallery on each quarter The apartments where the inferior\nofficers or common sailors sleep and mess, are usually called births;\nwhich see The bed-places built up for the sailors at the ships side in\nmerchantmen, are also called cabins CABLE, (cable, Fr ) a large, strong rope of a considerable length,\nused to retain a ship at anchor in a road, bay, or haven Cables are of various sorts and sizes In Europe they are usually\nmanufactured of hemp; in Africa they are more frequently composed\nof bass, which is a sort of long straw or rushes; and in Asia of a\npeculiar sort of Indian grass Cables, of what thickness soever, are generally formed of three\nropes twisted together, which are then called strands: each of these is\ncomposed of three smaller strands; and those last of a certain number\nof rope-yarns This number is therefore greater or smaller in\nproportion to the size of the cable required There are some cables, however, manufactured of four strands;\nwhich are chiefly the production of Italy and Provence All ships ought to be furnished with at least three good cables; the\nsheet cable, and the two bowers; best and small All cables ought to be one hundred and twenty fathoms in length;\nfor which purpose the threads or yarns must be one hundred and\neighty fathoms; inasmuch as they are diminished one third in length\nby twisting Besides this length, it is necessary to splice at least two\ncables together, in order to double the length when a ship is obliged\nto anchor in deep water For although it is not common to anchor in a\ngreater depth than forty fathoms, yet if there is only one cable, and\nthe ship rides in a storm and tempestuous sea, the anchor will of\nnecessity sustain the whole weight and violent jerking of the ship, in a\ndirection too nearly perpendicular By this effort it will unavoidably\nbe loosened from its hold, and dragged by the ship, which thus driven\nfrom her station, is in immediate danger of being wrecked on the\n\n\nnearest rocks or shallows; whereas it is evident, that if the cable, by\nits great length, were to draw more horizontally on the anchor, it\nwould bear a much greater force See Anchor The long cable is not so apt to break as the short one; because it\nwill bear a great deal more stretching before it comes to the greatest\nstrain: it therefore resembles a sort of spring, which may be very\neasily extended, and afterwards recovers its first state, as soon as the\nforce which extended it is removed Besides all this, a ship will ride\nmuch smoother with a long cable, and be less apt to pitch, or plunge\ndeep in the water with her fore-part On the contrary, the short cable, being too nearly vertical to the\nanchor, cannot bear such a strain, because it is charged with a greater\neffort; and, as it will not bear stretching, may break at the first violent\ntug The ship also rides with much greater difficulty, labours\nextremely, and often plunges all her fore-part under water By what has been said on this subject, we may see how very\nnecessary it is to furnish a ship with sufficiency of cables, or what is\ncalled ground-tackle; and what an inconsiderate policy it is in\nmerchants to expose their vessels to such evident dangers from the\nwant of them For we may venture to assert, without violation of\ntruth, that many good ships have been lost only on account of a\ndeficiency in this important article A cable ought neither to be twisted too much or too little; as in the\nformer state it will be extremely stiff, and difficult to manage; and in\nthe latter, it will be considerably diminished in its strength All cables are to each other as the cubes of their diameters The number of threads also, of which each cable is composed, being\nalways proportioned to its length and thickness, the weight and value\nof it are determined by this number Thus a cable of ten inches in\ncircumference, ought to consist of four hundred and eighty-five\nthreads; and weigh one thousand nine hundred and forty pounds: and\non this foundation is calculated the following table, very useful for all\npersons engaged in marine commerce, who equip merchant-ships on\ntheir own account, or freight them for the account of others A table of the number of threads and\nweight of cables of different\ncircumference Circumference in inches",

    "Robins The advantage of large cannon over those of a smaller bore is so\ngenerally acknowledged, that a particular discussion of it might\nperhaps be spared * * *\n“The most important advantage of heavy bullets is this, that with\nthe same velocity they break holes out in all solid bodies in a greater\nproportion than their weight; that is, for instance, a twenty-four\npound shot will, with the same velocity, break out a hole in any wall,\n\n\nrampart, or solid beam, in which it lodges, above eight times larger\nthan will be made by a three pound shot; for its diameter being\ndouble, it will make a superficial fracture above four times as great as\nthe three-pounder, (more of a smaller hole being closed up by the\nspringing of the solid body than of a great one) and it will penetrate\nto more than twice the depth; by this means the firmest walls of\nmasonry are easily cut through their whole substance by heavy shot,\nwhich could never be affected by those of a smaller caliber; and in\nships the strongest beams and masts are hereby fractured, which a\nvery great number of small bullets would scarcely injure “To this last advantage of large cannon, which is indeed a capital\none, there must be that of carrying the weight of their bullet in grape\nor lead shot, and thereby annoying the enemy more effectually than\ncould be done by ten times the number of small pieces “These are the principal advantages of large cannon, and hence it is\nno wonder that those entrusted with the care of the British navy have\nalways endeavoured to arm all ships with the largest cannon they\ncould with safety bear; and indeed, within these last hundred years,\ngreat improvements have been made on this head, by reducing the\nweight of many of the species of cannon, and thereby enabling the\nsame ships to carry guns of a larger bore: and, very lately, the six\npounders in some of the smaller ships have been changed for nine\npounders of a larger fabric than usual, which hath been justly\nesteemed a very great addition, to the strength of those ships “The importance then of allotting to all ships the largest cannon\nthey can with safety bear being granted, it remains to shew on what\nfoundation a change is proposed to be made in the fabric of all pieces\nfrom the present eighteen pounders downwards, so that they may be\nchanged for others of the same, or less weight, but of a larger bore This proposition turns on the following considerations —The species\nof cannon proper for each ship is limited by the weight of the pieces;\nand when the charge and effort of the bullet are assigned, this weight\nin each species is, or ought to be determined by the following\ncircumstances;\nThat they shall not be in danger of bursting;\nThat they shall not recoil too boisterously;\nAnd that they shall not heat too much in frequent firing “All this is to be done by a proper quantity of metal properly\ndisposed; and when the pieces are secured from these accidents, all\n\n\nadditional weight of metal, is not only useless but prejudicial “Now what dimensions and weight of metal are more than\nsufficient for these purposes, we may learn from the present practice\nof the navy, in the fabric of the thirty-two pounders, the heaviest guns\nin common use; these are made to weigh (if the author’s information\nbe right) from fifty-two to fifty-three hundred weight; that is\nsomewhat less than an hundred and two-thirds for each pound of\nbullet “From this then the author concludes, that any smaller piece, made\nupon the model of these thirty-two pounders, and having their weight\nproportioned in the same manner to the weight of their bullet, will\nfully answer all the purposes recited above, and will be of\nunexceptionable service “And he founds his opinions on these two principles: first, that the\nstrength of iron, or of any other metal, is in proportion to its\nsubstance; so that, for instance, where it has one half the substance, it\nhas one half the strength; and this supposition, he presumes, will be\nscarcely contested Secondly that the force of different quantities of\npowder fired in spaces which they respectively fill, is not exactly in\nthe proportion of those quantities; but the lesser quantity has in\nproportion the least force: that is, for instance, the force of one pound\nof powder, in like circumstances, is less than one half the force of two\npounds And this principle the author has deduced from many\nrepeated and diversified trials of his own; and he believes it will be\nfound agreeable to all the observations which have been made, or\nshall be made, on this subject “From these two considerations, he hopes, it will be granted him,\nthat, if two pieces, a large one and a small one, are made with all\ntheir dimensions in proportion to the diameter of their respective\nbullets, and consequently their weights in the same proportion with\nthe weights of their bullets, then the larger piece, with the same\nproportion of powder, will be more strained, will heat more, and\nrecoil more than the smaller “Hence then, as we are assured, that the present thirty-two\npounders are of a sufficient strength and weight for all marine\npurposes, we have the greatest reason to suppose, that, if all the\npieces of an inferior caliber were formed upon the same model,\nmeasuring by the diameter of the bullet, these smaller pieces would\nnot be defective, either in strength or weight, but would be to the full\nas serviceable on ship-board, as the present pieces, which are so much\n\n\noverloaded with metal “The author’s scheme then for augmenting the force of the present\nsea-batteries, is no more than this plain principle, that all ship-guns\nshould be cast upon the model of the thirty-two pounders, measuring\nby the diameter of the respective bullet; so that for each pound of\nbullet, there should be allowed one hundred and two thirds of metal\nonly “The advantages of this scheme will appear, by the following\ncomparison of the weight of the present pieces with their weight\nproposed by this new fabric Pieces Weight now in hundreds Ditto by new fabric",
    "Ditto by new fabric 24\n48 to 46\n40\n18\n41 to 39\n30\n12\n34 to 31\n20\n9\n29 to 26\n15\n6\n24 to 18\n10\n“Hence then it appears, that the twenty-four-pounders will be eased\nof six or eight hundred of useless metal; and instead of an inferior\ncaliber now used, much larger ones of the same weight may be borne,\nespecially when it is remembered, that this computation exceeds even\nthe present proportion of the thirty-two-pounders; so that from the\nabove projected eighteen pounders, for instance, two or three hundred\nweight may be safely taken ”\nThe changes then proposed by the author are these:\nPounders Hundreds Pounders Hundreds For\n6\nof\n24\nand\n18\nnew\n12\nof\n20\n9\n \n29 and 26\n \n18\nof\n28\n12\n \n34 and 31\n \n18\nof\n28\n18\n \n41 and 39\n \n24\nof\n40\n“The nine pounders lately cast, being, as the author is informed,\nstill lighter than what is here represented, they may perhaps be only\ntransformed into twelve pounders; but this will be a very great\naddition of strength, and the twelve-pounders thus borne will be\nconsiderably lighter than the smallest nine-pounders now in use The\n\n\nweight of the present three-pounders are not remembered exactly by\nthe author; but he doubts not, but they are heavier than the proposed\nsix-pounders, and may therefore be changed for them “That many objections will be made to the present proposal is not\nto be questioned; but, as they will equally hold against the use of the\npresent thirty-two-pounders, which are known to be guns of\nunexceptionable service, that alone, it is conceived, will be an answer “If it be supposed (as ancient practice is always favourably heard)\nthat the excesses in the proportionate weight of the small pieces must\nhave been originally founded on some approved principle, or\notherwise they could not have been brought into use, it may be\nanswered, that a hundred years since there were four-pounders made\nuse of, which were heavier than some of the present nine-pounders,\nand had the same prescription to plead in their behalf —Perhaps the\norigin of this excess in the smaller pieces may be accounted for by\nsupposing, that when guns are used in batteries on shore, their length\ncannot be in proportion to the diameter of their bore; because the\nparapet being of a considerable thickness, a short piece would, by its\nblast, ruin the embrasures; and the smaller pieces being for this reason\nmade nearly of the same length with the larger, did hence receive\ntheir additional weight of metal But this reason holds not at sea,\nwhere there is no other exception to the shortness of a piece, but the\nloss of force, which, in the instances here proposed, is altogether\ninconsiderable; for the old twelve-pounders, for example, being in\nlength from nine feet to nine feet, and a half, the new ones here\nproposed will be from seven feet to seven and a half long The\ndifference in the force of the bullet, fired from these different pieces,\nis but little; and it will hereafter appear, that in the present subject\nmuch greater differences than these are of no consequence “If it should be said, that the new fabric here proposed must have\nthe present allowance of powder (which in the smaller pieces is half\nthe weight of the ball) diminished, and that it must be reduced to the\nrate of the thirty-two-pounders, which is only seven-sixteenths of the\nweight of the ball; it is answered, that if the powder in all ship-cannon\nwhatever, was still farther reduced to one-third of the weight of the\nball, or even less, it would be a considerable advantage, not only by\nthe saving of ammunition, but by keeping the guns cooler and more\nquiet, and at the same time more effectually injuring the ships of the\nenemy[3]; for with the present allowance of powder the guns are\nheated, and their tackles and furniture strained, and this only to\n\n\nrender the bullet less efficacious than it would prove if impelled by a\nsmaller charge Indeed in battering of walls, which are not to be\npenetrated by a single shot from any piece whatever, the velocity of\nthe bullet, how much soever augmented, still produces a\nproportionate effect, by augmenting the depth to which it penetrates:\nbut the sides of the strongest ships, and the greater part of her\ntimbers, are of a limited thickness, insufficient to stop the generality\nof cannon bullets, fired at a reasonable distance, even with a less\ncharge than is here proposed And it is a matter of experiment, that a\nbullet, which can but just pass through a piece of timber, and loses\nalmost all its motion thereby, has a much better chance of rending\nand fracturing it, than if it passed through it with a much greater\nvelocity “That a much better judgment may be made of the reasonableness\nof this speculation, the author thinks proper to add (and he believes\nfuture experience will not contradict him) that a twelve-pounder, as\nhere proposed, which is one of the smallest pieces at present under\nconsideration, when charged with one-third of the weight of the bullet\nin powder, will penetrate a beam of the best seasoned toughest oak, to\nmore than twenty inches depth; and if, instead of one solid beam,\nthere are a number of small ones, or of planks laid together; then\nallowing for rending and tearing, frequent in such cases, he doubts\nnot, but it will often go through near double that thickness, and this\nany where within a hundred yards distance: that is, any where within\nthat distance, which the most experienced officers have recommended\nfor naval engagements In the same distance, a bullet from the twelve-\npounders now in use, charged with half the weight of powder, will\npenetrate about one-third part deeper: but if the efforts of each piece\nare compared together at five hundred yards distance, the differences\nof their forces will not be considerable If this be so, it will not be\nasserted, I imagine, that the twelve-pounder here proposed is less\nuseful, or less efficacious, for all naval purposes, than the weightier\ntwelve-pounder hitherto made use of “The author has in this proposal fixed on the thirty-two pounders,\nas the standard for the rest; because experience has long authorised\nthem But from the trials he has made, he is well satisfied, a much\ngreater reduction of weight, than is here proposed, might safely take\nplace; and that one fourth, or even one fifth of the weight of the bullet\nin powder, if properly disposed, is abundantly sufficient for every\nspecies of ship-guns[4] However, the author is far from desiring, that\n\n\nhis speculations should be relied on in an affair of this nature, where\nhe pretends not to have tried the very matter he proposes, but founds\nhis opinion on certain general principles and collateral experiments,\nwhich he conceives, he may apply to the present case without error He would himself recommend an experimental examination of this\nproposal, as the only one to which credit ought to be given What he\nintends by the present paper, is to represent it as a matter worthy of\nconsideration, and really such as it appeared to him: if those to whose\ncensure he submits it, are of the same opinion, there is an obvious\nmethod of determining how far his allegations are conclusive; and\nthat is by directing one of these pieces to be cast, a twelve-pounder\nfor instance, and letting it be proved with the same proportion of\npowder allotted for the proof of the thirty-two-pounders: Then if this\npiece be fired a number of times successively on a carriage, and its\nrecoil, and degree of heat be attended to, and if the penetration of its\nbullet into a thick butt of oak-beams or plank be likewise examined, a\njudgment may thence be formed, of what may be expected from the\npiece in real service; and the result of these trials will be the most\nincontestable confutation or confirmation of this proposal ”\nCANNONADE, as a term of the marine, may be defined the\napplication of artillery to the purposes of naval war, or the direction\nof its efforts against some distant object intended to be seized or\ndestroyed, as a ship, battery, or fortress Cannonading is therefore used in a vessel of war to take, sink, or\nburn the enemy’s ships, or to drive them from their defences ashore,\nand to batter and ruin their fortifications Since a large man of war may be considered as a combination of\nfloating batteries, it is evident that the efforts of her artillery must in\ngeneral be greatly superior to those of a fortress on the sea-coast: I say\nin general, because on some particular occasions her situation may be\nextremely \ndangerous, \nand \nher \ncannonading \nineffectual Her\nsuperiority consists in several circumstances, as, the power of bringing\nher different batteries to converge to one point; of shifting the line of\nher attack so as to do the greatest possible execution against the\nenemy; or to lie where she will be the least exposed to his shot: and\nchiefly because, by employing a much greater number of cannon\nagainst a fort than it can possibly return, the impression of her\nartillery against stone-walls soon, becomes decisive and irresistible Besides these advantages in the attack, she is also greatly superior in\npoint of defence: because the cannon shot passing with rapidity\n\n\nthrough her sides, seldom do any execution out of the line of their\nflight, or occasion much mischief by their splinters: whereas they very\nsoon shatter and destroy the faces of a parapet, and produce\nincredible havoc amongst the men, by the fragments of the stones, &c A ship may also retreat when she finds it too dangerous to remain\nlonger exposed to the enemy’s fire, or when her own fire cannot\nproduce the desired effect Finally, the fluctuating situation of a ship,\nand of the element on which she rests, renders the efforts of bombs\nvery uncertain, and altogether destroys the effect of the ricochet, or\nrolling and bounding shot, whose execution is so pernicious and\ndestructive in a fortress or land-engagement; both of which, however,\na ship may apply with great success See Range The chief inconveniency to which a ship is exposed, on the\ncontrary, is, that the low-laid cannon in a fort near the brink of the\nsea, may strike her repeatedly, on or under the surface of the water,\nso as to sink her before her cannonade can have any considerable\nefficacy CANOE, a sort of Indian boat or vessel, formed of the trunk of a tree\nhollowed, and sometimes of several pieces of the bark fastened\ntogether Canoes are of various sizes, according to the uses for which they\nmay be designed, or the countries wherein they are formed The\nlargest are made of the cotton tree, some of which will carry between\ntwenty and thirty hogsheads of sugar or molasses Some are made to\ncarry sail, and for this purpose are steeped in water till they become\npliant, after which their sides are extended, and strong beams placed\nbetween them, on which a deck is afterwards laid that serves to\nsupport their sides The other sorts very rarely carry sail, unless when\ngoing before the wind: their sails are made of a sort of silk grass or\nrushes They are commonly rowed with paddles, which are pieces of\nlight wood somewhat resembling a corn-shovel; and instead of rowing\nwith it horizontally, like an oar, they manage it perpendicularly The\nsmall canoes are very narrow, having only room for one person in\nbreadth, and seven or eight lengthways The rowers, who are\ngenerally negroes or American savages, are very expert in managing\ntheir paddles uniformly, and in ballancing the canoes properly with\ntheir bodies, which would be difficult for a stranger to do, how well\naccustomed soever to the conducting of European boats, because the\ncanoes are extremely light, and liable to be overturned The American Indians, when they are under the necessity of landing\n\n\nto avoid a water-fall, or of crossing the land from one river to another,\ncarry their canoes on their heads; till they arrive at a place where they\ncan lanch them again The following curious account of the canoes of the Esquimaux\nIndians in Labrador, has been lately transmitted to the author, which\nhe apprehends will not be displeasing to his readers The Esquimaux canoe has a light wooden frame, and the shell,\ninstead of plank, is made with seal-skins sewed together, which are\nnot only extended round the bottom and sides, but likewise over the\ntop; forming a compleat deck, and having only one opening,\nconveniently framed and situated to admit the Indian into his seat A\nflat hoop is fitted to this hole, rising about four inches, to which the\nsurrounding skin is sewed The Indian’s seal-skin jacket, being of a\nproper length, he can occasionally bind the skirt of it round the\noutside of this hoop; by which means he keeps the canoe free from\nwater, and is enabled to pursue his game far from land or in stormy\nseas His paddle is about ten feet long, light, and flat at each end, with\nwhich he both rows and steers with great velocity and exactness Mr Crantz, in his History of Greenland, informs us, that the young men in\ntheir exercise are taught to overset their canoes, and when the bottom\nis upward, to recover, by the dextrous management of their paddle,\ntheir former upright position, the men rising again either on the side\nby which they went down, or on the contrary, as they please The\nconstruction of this extraordinary little vessel, so admirably well\nadapted to the purposes of its owner, does the greatest credit to the\ningenuity of this savage people Though natives of the extensive\ncountry of Labrador, they inhabit only the sea-coasts, particularly the\nislands, the interior parts being no less barren, and possessed by other\nwandering tribes, their perpetual enemies and superiors at land; so\nthat they are reduced to almost an entire dependance upon the sea for\nthe common necessaries of life Seals-flesh and oil are amongst the\nchief articles of their food; and with the skins they make tents, canoes,\nand apparel Those islands on which the sea-fowl breed, they visit for\ntheir eggs and young; and kill birds in the water with their darts We\nare surprised, that provided thus, they should do so much execution\namongst these creatures; but when we behold a party of savages, each\nin his canoe, with only his harpoon and his lance, pursue, attack, and\nkill the largest whale, how justly are we filled with admiration The\nwhale’s flesh and oil they eat; and the tough substance of the gills,\ncommonly called whalebone, they apply very ingeniously to a great\n\n\nvariety of uses; trafficking with the overplus for such European goods\nas they want In their language, the canoe is called kaiak, or man’s-\nboat, to distinguish it from umiak, the woman’s boat The latter is a\nlarge boat managed by the women for transporting their families and\npossessions, when they shift their encampment from place to place, as\nmost convenient for the particular hunting of the season A kind of\nwolf-dog, natural to that country, is the only animal they breed for\nfood The same canoes, language, customs, and way of life, being\ncommon to the Greenlanders with the Esquimaux, it is evident they\nhave been originally one people There is a Greenland canoe in the Repository of the Royal Society,\ncovered with seal-skins, and exactly conformable to the above\ndescription CANTING, as a sea-phrase, denotes the act of turning any thing\nabout CANT-Timbers, in ship-building, those timbers which are situated\nat the two ends of a ship They derive their name from being canted,\nor raised obliquely from the keel; in contradistinction to those whose\nplanes are perpendicular to it The upper-ends of those on the bow, or\nfore-part of the ship, are inclined to the stem; as those in the after, or\nhind-part, incline to the stern-post above See the articles Timber and\nNaval Architecture The principal of these last is the fashion-piece, which forms the\noutline of the counter, terminating it on the sides CAP, chouquet, a strong, thick block of wood, used to confine two\nmasts together, when the one is erected at the head of the other, in\norder to lengthen it It is for this purpose furnished with two holes\nperpendicular to its length and breadth, and parallel to its thickness;\none of these is Square, and the other round; the former being solidly\nfixed upon the upper-end of the lower-mast, whilst the latter receives\nthe mast employed to lengthen it, and Secures it in this position The principal caps of a ship are those of the lower-masts, which are\nfitted with a strong eye-bolt on each side, wherein to hook the block\nby which the top-mast is drawn up through the cap; the process of\nwhich is explained in the article Mast The breadth of all caps is equal to twice the diameter of the top-\nmast, and the length to twice the breadth The thickness of the main\nand fore-caps is half the diameter of their breadths; the mizen-cap\nthree-sevenths, and the top-mast-caps two-fifths of their respective\nbreadths In the same manner as the top-mast slides up through the cap of the\nlower-mast, the top-gallant mast slides up through the cap of the top-\nmast The cap is represented by fig 9 plate II CAPE, a promontory, or head-land, which projects into the sea\nfarther than the rest of the coast CAPPANUS, a name given by some authors to the worm which\nadheres to, and gnaws the bottom of a ship The cappanus is extremely pernicious to ships, particularly in the\nEast and West Indies: to prevent this, several ships have lately been\nsheathed with copper; the first trial of which was made on his\nmajesty’s frigate Alarm CAP-SQUARE See the article Cannon CAPSTERN, or Capstan, (cabestan, Fr ) a strong, massy column of\ntimber, formed like a truncated cone, and having its upper extremity\npierced with a number of holes to receive the bars or levers It is let\ndown perpendicularly through the decks of a ship, and is fixed in such\nmanner, that the men, by turning it horizontally with their bars, may\nperform any work which requires an extraordinary effort A capstern is composed of several parts, (see plate II fig 11 ) where\nA is the barrel, b the whelps, c the drum-head, and d the spindle The whelps rise out from the main body of the capstern like\nbuttresses, to enlarge the sweep; so that a greater portion of the cable,\nor whatever rope encircles the barrel, may be wound about it at one\nturn, without adding much to the weight of the capstern The whelps\nreach downwards from the lower part of the drum-head to the deck Plate II fig 10",
    "10 The drum-head is a broad cylindrical piece of wood,\nresembling a mill-stone, and fixed immediately above the barrel and\nwhelps On the outside of this piece are cut a number of square holes,\nparallel to the deck, to receive the bars The pivot, or spindle, d, which is shod with iron, is the axis or foot\nupon which the capstern rests, and turns round in the saucer, which is\na sort of iron socket let into a wooden stock or standard, called the\nstep, resting upon, and bolted to the beams Besides the different parts of the capstern above explained, it is\nfurnished with several appurtenances, as the bars, the pins, the pawls,\nthe swifter, and the saucer, already described The bars are long pieces of wood, or arms, thrust into a number of\nsquare holes in the drum-head all round, in which they are as the\nradii of a circle, or the spokes to the nave of a wheel They are used to\nheave the capstern round, which is done by the men setting their\n\n\nbreasts against them and walking about, like the machinery of a\nhorse-mill, till the operation is finished The pins, e, are little bolts of iron thrust perpendicularly through\nthe holes of the drum-head, and through a correspondent hole in the\nend of the bar, made to receive the pins when the bars are fixed They\nare used to confine the bars, and prevent them from working out as\nthe men heave, or when the ship labours Every pin is fastened to the\ndrum-head with a small iron chain; and, that the bars may exactly fit\ntheir respective holes, they are all numbered The pawls, f, fig 10 are situated on each side of the capstern, being\ntwo short bars of iron, bolted at one end through the deck to the\nbeams close to the lower part of the whelps; the other end, which\noccasionally turns round on the deck, being placed in the intervals of\nthe whelps, as the capstern turns, prevents it from recoiling or turning\nback by any sudden jerk of the cable as the ship rises on the sea,\nwhich might greatly endanger the men who heave There are also\nhanging pawls g, g, fig 12, used for the same purposes, reaching from\nthe deck above to the drum-head immediately beneath it Plate ii To pace Capstern The swifter, is a rope passed horizontally through holes in the outer\nends of the bars, and drawn very tight: the intent of this is to keep the\nmen steddy as they walk round, when the ship rocks, and to give\nroom for a greater number to assist by pulling upon the swifter itself The most frequent use of the capstern is to heave in the cable, and\nthereby remove the ship, or draw up the anchor It is also used to\nwind up any weighty body, as the masts, artillery, &c In merchant-\nships it is likewise frequently employed to discharge or take in the\ncargo, particularly when consisting of weighty materials that require a\ngreat exertion of mechanical powers to be removed There are commonly two capsterns in a ship of war, the main and\nthe gear capstern; the former of which has two drum-heads, and may\nbe called a double one This is represented by fig 12 of plate II the\nlatter is exhibited in fig 11",
    "11 Formerly the bars of the capstern went intirely through the head of\nit, and consequently were more than twice the length of the present\nones; the holes were therefore formed at different heights, as\nrepresented in fig Formerly the bars of the capstern went intirely through the head of\nit, and consequently were more than twice the length of the present\nones; the holes were therefore formed at different heights, as\nrepresented in fig 10 plate II But this machine had several\ninconveniencies, such as the persons who heaved at the higher bars\nincommoding those at the lower ones; the bars being lifted or lowered\nby the persons who heaved at their opposite ends; some of the bars\nbeing too high, and others two low, &c It has therefore been long\nintirely disused in the navy Some of these sort of capsterns, however,\nare still retained in merchant ships, and are usually denominated\ncrabs The situation of the bars in a crab, as ready for heaving, is\nrepresented in fig 13 plate II To rig the Capstern, garnir, is to fix the bars in their respective\nholes, and thrust in the pins in order to confine them Surge the Capstern, choquer, is the order to slacken the rope\nheaved round upon it, of which there is generally two turns and a half\nabout the barrel at once, and sometimes three turns To heave the Capstern, virer au cabestan, is to go round with it\nheaving on the bars, and drawing in any rope of which the purchase is\ncreated To come up the Capstern, is to let go the rope upon which they had\nbeen heaving See the French term Cabestan, and the phrases\nannexed thereto To pawl the Capstern, is to fix the pawls to prevent it from\nrecoiling during any pause of heaving CAPTAIN of a ship of war, capitaine du haut bord, the officer who\ncommands a ship of the line of battle, or a frigate carrying twenty or\nmore cannon The charge of a captain in his majesty’s navy is very\ncomprehensive, inasmuch as he is not only answerable for any bad\nconduct in the military government, navigation, and equipment of the\nship he commands; but also for any neglect of duty, or ill\nmanagement in his inferior officers, whose several charges he is\nappointed to superintend and regulate On his first receiving information of the condition and quality of the\nship he is appointed to command, he must attend her constantly, and\nhasten the necessary preparations to fit her for sea So strict indeed\nare the injunctions laid on him by the lord high admiral, or\ncommissioners of the admiralty, that he is forbid to lie out of his ship,\nfrom his arrival on board, till the day of his discharge, unless by\nparticular leave from the admiralty, or his commander in chief He is enjoined to shew a laudable example of honour and virtue to\nthe officers and men, and to discountenance all dissolute, immoral,\nand disorderly practices, and such as are contrary to the rules of\ndiscipline and subordination, as well as to correct those who are\nguilty of such offences, as are punishable according to the usage of the\nsea He is ordered particularly to survey all the military stores which are\nsent on board, and to return whatsoever is deemed unfit for service His diligence and application are required to procure his complement\nof men; observing carefully to enter only such as are fit for the\nnecessary duty, that the government may not be put to improper\nexpence When his ship is fully manned, he is expected to keep the\nestablished number of men complete, and superintend the muster\nhimself, if there is no clerk of the check at the port When his ship is employed on a cruising station, he is expected to\nkeep the sea the whole length of time previously appointed; but if he\nis compelled by some unexpected accident to return to port sooner\nthan the limited time, he ought to be very cautious in the choice of a\ngood situation for anchoring, ordering the master, or other careful\nofficers, to sound, and discover the depths of water, and dangers of\n\n\nthe coast Previous to any possibility of engagement with an enemy, he is to\nquarter the officers and men to the necessary stations according to\ntheir office or abilities, and to exercise them in the management of the\nartillery, that they may be more expert in the time of battle See the\narticles Exercise and Quarters His station in an engagement is on the quarter-deck;

    "27 It is used to suspend the\nawnings; or to keep the top-sails from striking violently and fretting\nagainst the edges of the tops CROWNING, the finishing part of a knot made on the end of a rope It is performed by interweaving the ends of the different brands\nartfully amongst each other, so as that they may not become loosened\nor untwisted The design of these knots is to keep the end of the rope\nfast in some place assigned for it: they are more particularly useful in\nall kinds of stoppers CRUISE, campaigne (croiser, Fr ), a voyage or expedition in quest of\nvessels or fleets of the enemy, which may be expected to sail through\nany particular tract of the sea at a certain season of the year The\nregion in which these cruises are performed, is usually termed the\nrendezvous or cruising-latitude When the ships employed for this\npurpose, which are accordingly called cruisers, have arrived at their\ndestined station, they traverse the sea backward and forward, under\nan easy sail, and within a limited space, conjectured to be nearly in\nthe tract of their expected adversaries CUDDY, coqueron, a sort of cabin, or cook-room, in the fore-part, or\nnear the stern, of a lighter or barge of burden CUNNING, faire gouverner, the art of directing the steersman to\nguide the ship in her proper course: the officer who performs this duty\nis either the pilot or quarter-master CURRENT, in navigation, courans, (currens, Lat ) a certain\n\n\nprogressive movement of the water of the sea, by which all bodies\nfloating therein are compelled to alter their course, or velocity, or\nboth, and submit to the laws imposed on them by the current In the sea, currents are either natural and general, as arising from\nthe diurnal rotation of the earth about its axis; or accidental and\nparticular, caused by the waters being driven against promontories, or\ninto gulfs and streights; where, wanting room to spread, they are\ndriven back, and thus disturb the ordinary flux of the sea “Currents are various, and directed towards different parts of the\nocean, of which some are constant, and others periodical The most\nextraordinary current of the sea is that by which part of the Atlantic\nor African ocean moves about Guinea from Cape Verd towards the\ncurvature or bay of Africa, which they call Fernando Poo, viz from\nwest to east, contrary to the general motion And such is the force of\nthis current, that when ships approach too near the shore, it carries\nthem violently towards that bay, and deceives the mariners in their\nreckoning “There is a great variety of shifting currents, which do not last, but\nreturn at certain periods; and these do, most of them, depend upon,\nand follow the anniversary winds or monsoons, which by blowing in\none place may cause a current in another[8] ” Varenius In the streights of Gibraltar the currents almost constantly drive to\nthe eastward, and carry ships into the Mediterranean: they are also\nfound to drive the same way into St George’s-channel The setting, or progressive motion of the current, may be either\nquite down to the bottom, or to a certain determinate depth As the knowledge of the direction and velocity of currents is a very\nmaterial article in navigation, it is highly necessary to discover both,\nin order to ascertain the ship’s situation and course with as much\naccuracy as possible The most successful method which has been\nhitherto attempted by mariners for this purpose, is as follows A\ncommon iron pot, which may contain four or five gallons, is\nsuspended by a small rope fastened to its ears or handles, so as to\nhang directly upright, as when placed upon the fire This rope, which\nmay be from 70 to 100 fathoms in length, being prepared for the\nexperiment, is coiled in the boat, which is hoisted out of the ship at a\nproper opportunity, when there is little or no wind to ruffle the\nsurface of the sea The pot being then thrown overboard into the\nwater, and immediately sinking, the line is slackened till about\nseventy or eighty fathoms run out, after which the line is fastened to\n\n\nthe boat’s stem, by which she is accordingly restrained, and rides as at\nanchor The velocity of the current is then easily tried by the log and\nhalf-minute glass, the usual method of discovering the rate of a ship’s\nsailing at sea The course of the stream is next obtained by means of\nthe compass provided for this operation Having thus found the setting and drift of the current, it remains to\napply this experiment to the purposes of navigation If the ship sails\nalong the direction of the current, then the motion of the ship is\nincreased by as much as is the drift or velocity of the current If a current sets directly against the ship’s course, then her motion is\nretarded in proportion to the strength of the current Hence it is plain,\n1",
    "Hence it is plain,\n1 If the velocity of the current be less than that of the ship, then\nthe ship will advance so much as is the difference of these velocities 2 If the velocity of the current be more than that of the ship, then\nwill the ship fall as much astern as is the difference of these velocities 3 If the velocity of the current be equal to that of the ship, then\nwill the ship stand still, the one velocity destroying the other If the current thwarts the course of a ship, it not only diminishes or\nincreases her velocity, but gives her a new direction, compounded of\nthe course she steers, and the setting of the current, as appears by the\nfollowing\nLEMMA If a body at A be impelled by two forces at the same time, the one\nin the direction A B, carrying it from A to B in a certain space of time,\nand the other in the direction A D, pushing it from A to D in the same\ntime; complete the parallelogram ABCD, and draw the diagonal A C:\nthen the body at A, (which let us suppose a ship agitated by the wind\nand current; A B, being the line along which she advances as\nimpressed by the wind, and A D the line upon which she is driven by\nthe current) will move along the diagonal A C, and will be in the\npoint C, at the end of the time in which it would have moved along A\nD or AB, as impelled by either of those forces (the wind or current)\nseparately CUTTER, bateau, a small vessel commonly navigated in the channel\nof England;

an operation which by mariners is called fishing the anchor The anchors being situated on both the bows, the davit may be\noccasionally shifted so as to project over either side of the ship,\naccording to the position of that anchor on which it is to be employed The inner-end of the davit is secured by being thrust into a square\nring of iron b, which is bolted to the deck, and fore-locked under the\nbeams This ring, which is called the span-shackle, exhibited at large\nby fig 34, is fixed exactly in the middle of the deck, and close behind\nthe fore-mast Upon the outer-end of the davit is hung a large block c,\nthrough which a strong rope traverses, called the fish-pendant d, to\nwhose foremost end is fitted a large iron hook e, and to its after end a\ntackle or complication of pullies f, the former of which is called the\nfish-hook, and the latter the fish-tackle The davit therefore, according to the sea-phrase, is employed to fish\nthe anchor, which being previously catted, the fish-hook is fastened\nupon its flukes; and the effort of the tackle, being transmitted to the\nhook by means of the fish-pendant, draws up that part of the anchor\nsufficiently high upon the bow to fasten it, which is done by the\nShank-painter See that article There is also a davit of a smaller kind, occasionally fixed in the\nlongboat, and employed to weigh the anchor therein DAY’S-WORK, cinglage, the reckoning or account of the ship’s\ncourse, during twenty-four hours, or between noon and noon,\naccording to the rules of trigonometry See Dead-Reckoning DEAD-EYE, cap de mouton, a sort of round, flattish, wooden block,\nsee fig 30, plate II It is usually encircled with the end of a rope, or\nwith an iron band, fig 31, b, and pierced with three holes through the\nflat, in order to receive the rope called a laniard c, which\ncorresponding with three holes in another dead-eye a, creates a\npurchase employed for various uses, but chiefly to extend the shrouds\nand stays, otherwise called the standing-rigging In order to form this purchase, one of the dead-eyes is fastened in\nthe lower-end of each shroud, and the opposite one in the upper-link\nof each chain on the ship’s side, which is made round to receive and\n\n\nencompass the hollowed outer-edge of the dead-eye After this the\nlaniard is passed alternately through the holes in the upper and lower\ndead-eyes till it becomes six-fold;

only to remark, that it is most\nreligiously observed, both in merchant-ships and his majesty’s navy To Ease off, or Ease away, molir, filer, to slacken gradually any\nsingle rope, or complication of ropes, formed into a tackle EBB, jussant, the reflux of the tide, or the return of it into the sea\nafter the highest of the flood, usually termed full-sea, or high-water EDDY, remoux, (ed, backward, again, and ea, water, Sax ) the water\nthat, by some interruption in its course, runs contrary to the direction\nof any river, or current, and appears like the motion of a whirlpool To EDGE away, in navigation, abattre, to decline gradually from the\nshore, or from the line of the course which the ship formerly steered:\nit is particularly applied when a ship changes her course, by sailing\nnearer the direction of the wind;

or an action of hostility between single ships, or\ndetachments, or squadrons of men of war In order to have a clearer idea of this article, it will, therefore, be\nnecessary that the reader who is little acquainted with the subject,\nshould previously refer to the explanation of those terms, as also to\nthe articles Cannon, Division, Exercise, Fleet, and Line of Battle The sea-fights of the ancients were usually carried on in two\ndifferent manners Advanced by the force of their oars, the gallies ran\nviolently aboard of each other, and by the mutual encounter of their\nbeaks and prows, and sometimes of their sterns, endeavoured to dash\nin pieces, or sink their enemies The prow, for this purpose, was commonly armed with a brazen\npoint or trident, nearly as low as the surface of the sea, in order to\npierce the enemy’s ships under the water Some of the gallies were\nfurnished with large turrets, and other accessions of building, either\nfor attack or defence The soldiers also annoyed their enemies with\ndarts and slings, and, on their nearer approach, with swords and\njavelins; and, in order that their missive weapons might be directed\nwith greater force and certainty, the ships were equipped with several\nplatforms, or elevations above the level of the deck[9] The sides of the\nship were fortified with a thick fence of hides, which served to repel\nthe darts of their adversaries, and to cover their own soldiers, who\nthereby annoyed the enemy with greater security As the invention of gun-powder has rendered useless many of the\nmachines employed in the naval wars of the ancients, the great\ndistance of time has also consigned many of them to oblivion: some\nfew are, nevertheless, recorded in ancient authors, of which we shall\nendeavour to present a short description And first,\nThe Δελφιν was a large and massy piece of lead or iron, cast in the\nform of a dolphin This machine being suspended by blocks at their\nmast-heads or yard-arms, ready for a proper occasion, was let down\nviolently from thence into the adverse ships, and either penetrated\nthrough their bottom, and opened a passage for the entering waters,\nor by its weight immediately sunk the vessel The Δρήπαναν an engine of iron crooked like a sickle, and fixed on\nthe top of a long pole It was employed to cut asunder the slings of the\nsail-yards, and, thereby letting the sails fall down, to disable the vessel\nfrom escaping, and incommode her greatly during the action Similar\nto this was another instrument, armed at the head with a broad two-\nedged blade of iron, wherewith they usually cut away the ropes that\nfastened the rudder to the vessel[10] Δόρατα ναύμαχα, a sort of spears or maces of an extraordinary\nlength, sometimes exceeding twenty cubits, as appears by the 15th\nIliad of Homer[11], by whom they are also called μακρὰ Κιραῖαι were certain machines used to throw large stones into the\nenemies ships Vegetius mentions another engine, which was suspended to the\nmain-mast, and resembled a battering-ram: for it consisted of a long\nbeam, and an head of iron, and was, with great violence, pushed\nagainst the sides of the enemies gallies They had also a grappling-iron, which was usually thrown into the\nadverse ship by means of an engine: this instrument facilitated the\nentrance of the soldiers appointed to board, which was done by means\nof wooden bridges, that were generally kept ready for this purpose in\nthe fore-part of the vessel[12] The arms used by the ancients rendered the disposition of their\nfleets very different, according to the time, place and circumstances They generally considered it an advantage to be to windward, and to\nhave the sun shining directly on the front of their enemy The order of\nbattle chiefly depended on their power of managing the ships, or of\ndrawing them readily into form; and on the schemes which their\nofficers had concerted The fleet being composed of rowing-vessels,\nthey lowered their sails previous to the action: they presented their\n\n\nprows to the enemy, and advanced against each other by the force of\ntheir oars[13] Before they joined battle, the admirals went from ship to\nship, and exhorted their soldiers to behave gallantly All things being\nin readiness, the signal was displayed by hanging out of the admiral’s\ngalley a gilded shield, or a red garment or banner During the\nelevation of this the action continued, and by its depression, or\ninclination towards the right or left, the rest of the ships were directed\nhow to attack, or retreat from their enemies To this was added the\nsound of trumpets, which began in the admiral’s galley, and continued\nround the whole navy The light was also begun by the admiral’s\ngalley, by grappling, boarding, and endeavouring to overset, sink, or\ndestroy, the adversary, as we have above described[14] Sometimes, for\nwant of grappling irons, they fixed their oars in such a manner as to\nhinder the enemy from retreating [15] If they could not manage their\noars as dexterously as their antagonists, or fall along-side so as to\nboard him, they penetrated his vessel with the brazen prow The\nvessels approached each other as well as their circumstances would\npermit, and the soldiers were obliged to fight hand to hand, till the\nbattle was decided: nor indeed could they fight otherwise with any\ncertainty, since the shortest distance rendered their slings and arrows,\nand almost all their offensive weapons, ineffectual, if not useless The\nsquadrons were sometimes ranged in two or three right lines, parallel\nto each other; being seldom drawn up in one line, unless when formed\ninto an half moon This order indeed appears to be the most\nconvenient for rowing vessels that engage by advancing with their\nprows towards the enemy At the battle of Ecnomus, between the\nRomans and the Carthaginians, the fleet of the former was ranged into\na triangle, or a sort of wedge in front, and towards the middle of its\ndepth, of two right parallel lines That of the latter was formed into a\nrectangle, or two sides of a square, of which one branch extended\nbehind, and, as the opening of the other prosecuted the attack, was\nready to fall upon the flank of such of the Roman gallies as should\nattempt to break their line Ancient history has preserved many of\nthese orders, of which some have been followed in later times Thus,\nin a battle in A D",
    "D 1340, the English fleet was formed in two lines, the\nfirst of which contained the larger ships, the second consisted of all\nthe smaller vessels, used as a reserve to support the former whenever\nnecessary In 1545 the French fleet under the command of the\nMareschal d’Annebault, in an engagement with the English in the\nChannel, was arranged in the form of a crescent The whole of it was\n\n\ndivided into three bodies, the center being composed of thirty-six\nships, and each of the wings of thirty He had also many gallies; but\nthese fell not into the line, being designed to attack the enemy\noccasionally This last disposition was continued down to the reigns of\nJames I and Louis XIII[16] Meanwhile the invention of gun-powder, in 1330, gradually\nintroduced the use of fire-arms into naval war, without finally\nsuperseding the ancient method of engagement The Spaniards were\narmed with cannon in a sea-fight against the English and the people of\nPoitou abreast of Rochelle in 1372; and this battle is the first wherein\nmention is made of artillery in our navies Many years elapsed before\nthe marine armaments were sufficiently provided with fire-arms[17] So\ngreat a revolution in the manner of fighting, and which necessarily\nintroduced a total change in the construction of ships, could not be\nsuddenly effected In short, the squadrons of men of war are no longer\nformed of rowing-vessels, or composed of gallies and ships of the line,\nbut entirely of the latter, which engage under sail, and discharge the\nwhole force of their artillery from their sides Accordingly they are\nnow disposed in no other form than that of a right line parallel to the\nenemy; every ship keeping close-hauled upon a wind on the same tack Indeed the difference between the force and manner of fighting of\nships and gallies rendered their service in the same line incompatible When we consider therefore the change introduced, both in the\nconstruction and working of ships, occasioned by the use of cannon, it\nnecessarily follows, that squadrons of men of war must appear in the\norder that is now generally adopted Finally, the ships ought to\npresent their broad-sides to the enemy; and to sail close upon a wind\nin the wake of each other; as well to retain their own uniformity, as to\npreserve or acquire the advantage which the weather-gage gives them\nover their adversary[18] The machines which owe their rise to the invention of gun powder\nhave now totally supplanted the others; so that there is scarce any but\nthe sword remaining, of all the weapons used by the ancients Our\nnaval battles are therefore almost always decided by fire-arms, of\nwhich there are several kinds, known by the general name of artillery In a ship of war fire-arms are distinguished into cannon mounted on\ncarriages, swivel-cannon, grenadoes, and musquetry The first has\nbeen already described at large in its proper place The second is a\nsmall piece of artillery, carrying a shot of half a pound, and fixed in a\nsocket on the top of the ships side, stern or bow, and also in her tops The trunnions of this piece are contained in a sort of iron crotch,\nwhose lower-end terminates in a cylindrical pivot resting in the\nsocket, so as to support the weight of the cannon The socket is bored\nin a strong piece of oak, reinforced with iron hoops, in order to enable\nit to sustain the recoil By means of this frame, which is called the\nswivel, and an iron handle on its cascabel, the gun may be directed by\nhand to any object It is therefore very necessary in the tops,\nparticularly when loaded with musket-balls, to fire down on the\nupper-decks of the adversary in action ——The grenado is a kind of\nlittle bomb of the same diameter as a four pound bullet; it weighs\nabout two pounds, being charged with four or five ounces of powder ——Grenadoes are thrown from the tops by the hands of the seamen They have a touch-hole in the same manner as a bomb, and a fuse of\nthe same composition See Mortar The sailor fires the fuse with a\nmatch, and throws the grenado as he is directed: the powder being\ninflamed, the shell instantly bursts into splinters, that kill or maim\nwhomsoever they reach on the decks of the enemy As this machine\ncannot be thrown by hand above fifteen or sixteen fathoms, the ship\nmust be pretty near, to render it useful in battle ——The musket or\nfirelock is so well known, that it appears unnecessary to describe it in\nthis place —Besides these machines, there are several others used in\nmerchant-ships and privateers, as coehorns, carabines, fire-arrows,\norgans, powder-flasks, stink-pots, &c[19] Since a general engagement of fleets or squadrons of men of war is\nnothing else than a variety of particular actions of single ships with\neach other, in a line of battle; it appears necessary, according to the\nplan of this work, to begin by describing the latter, and then proceed\nto represent the usual manner of conducting the former The whole oeconomy of a naval engagement may be arranged\nunder the following heads, viz the preparation; the action; and the\nrepair, or refitting, for the purposes of navigation The preparation is began by issuing the order to clear the ship for\naction, which is repeated by the boatswain and his mates at all the\nhatchways or stair-cases, leading to the different batteries As the\nmanagement of the artillery in a vessel of war requires a considerable\nnumber of men, it is evident that the officers and sailors must be\nrestrained to a narrow space in their usual habitations, in order to\npreserve the internal regularity of the ship Hence the hammocs, or\nhanging-beds, of the latter are crowded together as close as possible\nbetween the decks, each of them being limited to the breadth of\n\n\nfourteen inches They are hung parallel to each other, in rows\nstretching from one side of the ship to the other, nearly throughout\nher whole length, so as to admit of no passage but by stooping under\nthem As the cannon therefore cannot be worked while the hammocs\nare suspended in this situation, it becomes necessary to remove them\nas quick as possible By this circumstance a double advantage is\nobtained: the batteries of cannon are immediately cleared of an\nincumbrance, and the hammocs are converted into a sort of parapet,\nto prevent the execution of small-shot on the quarter-deck, tops, and\nfore-castle At the summons of the boatswain, Up all hammocs every\nsailor repairs to his own, and, having stowed his bedding properly, he\ncords it up firmly with a lashing, or line provided for that purpose He\nthen carries it to the quarter-deck, poop, or forecastle, or wherever it\nmay be necessary As each side of the quarter-deck and poop is\nfurnished with a double net-work, supported by iron cranes fixed\nimmediately above the gunnel or top of the ship’s-side; the hammocs\nthus corded are firmly stowed by the quarter-master between the two\nparts of the netting, so as to form an excellent barrier The tops,\nwaiste, and fore-castle, are then fenced in the same manner Whilst these offices are performed below, the boatswain and his\nmates are employed in securing the sail-yards, to prevent them from\ntumbling down when the ship is cannonaded, as she might thereby be\ndisabled, and rendered incapable of attack, retreat, or pursuit The\nyards are now likewise secured by strong chains, or ropes, additional\nto those by which they are usually suspended The boatswain also\nprovides the necessary materials to repair the rigging, wherever it\nmay be damaged by the shot of the enemy; and to supply whatever\nparts of it may be entirely destroyed The carpenter and his crew in\nthe meanwhile prepare his shot-plugs and mauls, to close up any\ndangerous breaches that may be made near the surface of the water;\nand provide the iron-work necessary to refit the chain-pumps, in case\ntheir machinery should be wounded in the engagement The gunner\nwith his mates and quarter-gunners is busied in examining the cannon\nof the different batteries, to see that their charges are thoroughly dry\nand fit for execution: to have every thing ready for furnishing the\ngreat guns and small arms with powder, as soon as the action begins:\nand to keep a sufficient number of cartridges continually filled, to\nsupply the place of those expended in battle The master and his\nmates are attentive to have the sails properly trimmed, according to\nthe situation of the ship; and to reduce or multiply them, as occasion\n\n\nrequires, with all possible expedition The lieutenants visit the\ndifferent decks, to see that they are effectually cleared of all\nincumbrance, so that nothing may retard the execution of the\nartillery: and to enjoin the other officers to diligence and alertness, in\nmaking the necessary dispositions for the expected engagement, so\nthat every thing may be in readiness at a moment’s warning When the hostile ships have approached each other to a competent\ndistance, the drums beat to arms The boatswain and his mates pipe,\nall hands to quarters at every hatchway All the persons appointed to\nmanage the great guns, immediately repair to their respective\nstations The crows, handspikes, rammers, spunges, powder-horns,\nmatches, and train tackles, are placed in order by the side of every\ncannon The hatches are immediately laid, to prevent any one from\ndeserting his post by escaping into the lower apartments The marines\nare drawn up in rank and file, on the quarter-deck, poop, and fore-\ncastle The lashings of the great guns are cast loose, and the tompions\nwithdrawn The whole artillery, above and below, is run out at the\nports, and levelled to the point-blank range ready for firing The necessary preparations being completed, and the officers and\ncrew ready at their respective stations, to obey the order, the\ncommencement of the action is determined by the mutual distance\nand situation of the adverse ships, or by the signal from the\ncommander in chief of the fleet or squadron The cannon being\nlevelled in parallel rows, projecting from the ship’s side, the most\nnatural order of battle is evidently to range the ships abreast of each\nother, especially if the engagement is general The most convenient\ndistance is probably within the point-blank range of a musket, so that\nall the artillery may do effectual execution The combat usually begins by a vigorous cannonade, accompanied\nwith the whole efforts of the swivel-guns and the small arms The\nmethod of firing in platoons, or vollies of cannon at once, appears\ninconvenient in the sea-service, and perhaps should never be\nattempted, unless in the battering of a fortification The sides and\ndecks of the ship, although sufficiently strong for all the purposes of\nwar, would be too much shaken by so violent an explosion and recoil The general rule observed on this occasion throughout the ship, is to\nload, fire, and spunge, the guns with all possible expedition, yet\nwithout confusion or precipitation The captain of each gun is\nparticularly enjoined to fire only when the piece is properly directed\nto its object, that the shot may not be fruitlessly expended The\n\n\nlieutenants who command the different batteries, traverse the deck to\nsee that the battle is prosecuted with vivacity; and to exhort and\nanimate the men to their duty The midshipmen second these\ninjunctions, and give the necessary assistance wherever it may be\nrequired, at the guns committed to their charge The gunner should be particularly attentive that all the artillery is\nsufficiently supplied with powder, and that the cartridges are carefully\nconveyed along the decks in covered boxes The havoc produced by a\ncontinuation of this mutual assault may be readily conjectured by the\nreader’s imagination: battering, penetrating, and splintering the sides\nand decks; shattering or dismounting the cannon; mangling and\ndestroying the rigging; cutting asunder, or carrying away the masts\nand yards; piercing and tearing the sails so as to render them useless;\nand wounding, disabling, or killing the ship’s company The\ncomparative vigour and resolution of the assailants to effect these\npernicious consequences in each other, generally determine their\nsuccess or defeat: I say generally, because the fate of the combat may\nsometimes be decided by an unforeseen incident, equally fortunate for\nthe one and fatal to the other The defeated ship having\nacknowledged the victory, by striking her colours, is immediately\ntaken possession of by the conqueror, who secures her officers and\ncrew as prisoners in his own ship; and invests his principal officer\nwith the command of the prize until a captain is appointed by the\ncommander in chief The engagement being concluded, they begin the repair: the cannon\nare secured by their breechings and tackles, with all convenient\nexpedition Whatever sails have been rendered unserviceable are\nunbent; and the wounded masts and yards struck upon the deck, and\nfished, or replaced by others The standing rigging is knotted, and the\nrunning rigging spliced wherever necessary Proper sails are bent in\nthe room of those which have been displaced as useless The carpenter\nand his crew are employed in repairing the breaches made in the\nship’s hull, by shot-plugs, pieces of plank, and sheet-lead The gunner\nand his assistants are busied in replenishing the allotted number of\ncharged cartridges, to supply the place of those which have been\nexpended, and in refitting whatever furniture of the cannon may have\nbeen damaged by the late action Such is the usual process and consequences of an engagement\nbetween two ships of war, which may be considered as an epitome of\na general battle between fleets or squadrons, The latter, however,\n\n\ninvolves a greater variety of incidents, and necessarily requires more\ncomprehensive skill and judgment in the commanding officer When the admiral, or commander in chief, of a naval armament has\ndiscovered an enemy’s fleet, his principal concern is usually to\napproach it, and endeavour to come to action as soon as possible Every inferior consideration must be sacrificed to this important\nobject; and every rule of action should tend to hasten and prepare for\nso material an event The state of the wind, and the situation of his\nadversary, will, in some measure, dictate the conduct necessary to be\npursued with regard to the disposition of his ships on this occasion To\nfacilitate the execution of the admiral’s orders, the whole fleet is\nranged into three squadrons, each of which is classed into three\ndivisions, under the command of different officers Before the action\nbegins, the adverse fleets are commonly drawn up in two lines\nparallel to each other, and close-hauled We have endeavoured to\nexplain the propriety and necessity of this disposition in the article\nLine As soon as the admiral displays the signal for the line of battle,\nthe several divisions separate from the columns, in which they were\ndisposed in the usual order of sailing, and every ship crouds into its\nstation in the wake, of the next a-head: and a proper distance from\neach other, which is generally about fifty fathom, is regularly\nobserved from the van to the rear The admiral, however, will,\noccasionally, contract or extend his line, so as to conform to the\nlength of that of his adversary, whose neglect, or inferior skill, on this\noccasion, he will naturally convert to his own advantage; as well as to\nprevent his own line from being doubled, a circumstance which might\nthrow his van and rear into confusion When the adverse fleets approach each other, the courses are\ncommonly hauled up in the brails, and the top-gallant sails and stay\nsails furled The movement of each ship is chiefly regulated by the\nmain and fore-top sails, and the jib; the mizen-top sail being reserved\nto hasten or retard the course of the ship, and, in fine, by filling or\nbacking, hoisting or lowering it, to determine her velocity The frigates, tenders, and fire-ships, being also hauled upon a wind,\nlie at some distance, ready to execute the admiral’s orders, or those of\nhis seconds, leaving the line of battle between them and the enemy If\nthere are any transports and store-ships attendant on the fleet, these\nare disposed still further distant from the action If the fleet is superior\nin number to that of the enemy, the admiral usually selects a body of\nreserve from the different squadrons, which will always be of use to\n\n\ncover the fire-ships, bomb-vessels, &c and may fall into the line in\nany case of necessity: these also are stationed at a convenient distance\nfrom the line, and should evidently be opposite to the weakest parts\nthereof And here it may not be improper to observe, with an ingenious\nFrench author[20], that order and discipline give additional strength\nand activity to a fleet If thus a double advantage is acquired by every\nfleet, it is certainly more favourable to the inferior, which may\nthereby change its disposition with greater facility and dispatch than\none more numerous, yet without being separated When courage is\nequal to both, good order is then the only resource of the smaller\nnumber Hence we may infer that a smaller squadron of men of war,\nwhose officers are perfectly disciplined in working their ships, may,\nby its superior dexterity, vanquish a more powerful one, even at the\ncommencement of the fight; because the latter being less expert in the\norder of battle, will, by its separation, suffer many of the ships to\nremain useless, or not sufficiently near, to protect each other[21] The signal for a general engagement is usually displayed when the\nopposite fleets are sufficiently within the range of point-blank shot, so\nthat they may level the artillery with certainty of execution, which is\nnear enough for a line of battle The action is begun and carried on\nthroughout the fleet, in the manner we have already described\nbetween single ships, at which time the admiral carries little sail,\nobserving, however, to regulate his own motions by those of the\nenemy The ships of the line mean while keep close in their stations,\nnone of which should hesitate to advance in their order, although\ninterrupted by the situation of some ship a-head, which has\nnegligently fallen astern of her station Such is now the practice of naval war, that the necessary order of\nbattle, and the fabric of our ships, very seldom permit the assault of\nboarding, unless in single actions No captain ought therefore to\nabandon his station in the line, under any pretence whatsoever, unless\nhis ship is too much disabled to continue the combat The small\nquantity of sail carried on this occasion will permit the bulk of the\nfleet, altho’ somewhat impaired, to continue their cannonade a long\ntime without quitting the line An ambition to distinguish himself should never seduce any captain\nto break the line, in order to atchieve any distant enterprize, however\nthe prospect may flatter him with success He ought to wait the signal\nof the admiral or his commanding officer; because it is more essential\n\n\nto preserve the regularity of a close line, which constitutes the\nprincipal force of the fleet, than to prosecute a particular action,\nwhich, although brilliant in itself, has seldom any material\nconsequences, unless its object is to seize a flag-ship, and even this\ncan only be justified by success[22] The various exigencies of the combat call forth the skill and\nresources of the admiral, to keep his line as complete as possible,\nwhen it has been unequally attacked; by ordering ships from those in\nreserve, to supply the place of others which have suffered greatly by\nthe action; by directing his fire-ships at a convenient time to fall\naboard the enemy; by detaching ships from one part of the line or\nwing which is stronger, to another which is greatly pressed by\nsuperior force, and requires assistance His vigilance is ever necessary\nto review the situation of the enemy from van to rear, every motion of\nwhom he should, if possible, anticipate and frustrate He should seize\nthe favourable moments of occasion, which are rapid in their\nprogress, and never return Far from being disconcerted by any\nunforeseen incident, he should endeavour, if possible, to make it\nsubservient to his design His experience and reflection will naturally\nfurnish him with every method of intelligence to discover the state of\nhis different squadrons and divisions Signals of enquiry and answers;\nof request and assent; of command and obedience; will be displayed\nand repeated on this occasion Tenders and boats will also continually\nbe detached between the admiral and the commanders of the several\nsquadrons or divisions As the danger presses on him, he ought to be fortified by resolution\nand presence of mind, because the whole fleet is committed to his\ncharge, and the conduct of his officers may, in a great degree, be\ninfluenced by his intrepidity and perseverance In short, his renown or\ninfamy may depend on the fate of the day If he conquers in battle, he ought to prosecute his victory as much\nas possible, by seizing, burning, or destroying the enemies ships If he\nis defeated, he should endeavour by every resource his experience can\nsuggest, to have as many of his fleet as possible; by employing his\ntenders, &c to take out the wounded and put fresh men in their\nplaces; by towing the disabled ships to a competent distance, and by\npreventing the execution of the enemies fire-ships In order to retreat\nwith more security, he may judge it expedient to range his fleet into\nthe form of an half-moon, placing himself in the center By this\ndisposition the enemy’s ships which attempt to fall upon his rear, will\n\n\nat once expose themselves to the fire of the admiral, and his seconds,\nin a disadvantageous situation; a circumstance which will serve to\nfacilitate the escape of his own ships, and retard the pursuit of those\nof his adversary If his fleet is too much extended by this arrangement, the wings or\nquarters are easily closed, and the half-moon rendered more complete;\nin the midst of which may be placed his store-ships, tenders, &c In\nflying, or retreating, the uncertainty of the weather is to be\nconsidered: it may become calm, or the wind may shift in his favour His schemes may be assisted by the approach of night, or the\nproximity of the land; since he ought rather to run the ships ashore, if\npracticable, than suffer them to be taken afloat, and thereby transfer\nadditional strength to the enemy In short, nothing should be\nneglected that may contribute to the preservation of his fleet, or\nprevent any part of it from falling into the hands of the conqueror By what we have observed, the real force, or superiority, of a fleet\nconsists less in the number of vessels, and the vivacity of the action,\nthan in good order, dexterity in working the ships, presence of mind,\nand skilful conduct in the captains ENSIGN, pavillon de pouppe, (enseigne, Fr ) a large standard, or\nbanner, hoisted on a long pole erected over the poop, and called the\nensign-staff The ensign is used to distinguish the ships of different nations from\neach other, as also to characterise the different squadrons of the navy The British ensign in ships of war is known by a double cross, viz",

fire-barrels are placed under the four fire-trunks;\nand the other four between them, two on each side the fire-skuttles,\nwhere they are securely cleated to the deck The longest reeds[26] are\n\n\nput into the fore and aft troughs, and tied down: the shortest reeds are\nlaid in the troughs athwart, and tied down also The bavins[27], dipped\nat one end, are tied fast to the troughs over the reeds and the curtains\nare nailed up to the beams, in equal quantities, on each side of the\nfire-room The remainder of the reeds are placed in a position nearly upright,\nat all the angles of every square in the fire-room, and there tied down If any reeds are left, they are to be put round the fire-barrels, and\nother vacant places, and there tied fast Instructions to prime Take up all your reeds, one after another, and strow a little\ncomposition at the bottom of all the troughs under the reeds, and then\ntye them gently down again: next strow composition upon the upper\npart of the reeds throughout the fire-room, and upon the said\ncomposition lay double quick-match[28] upon all the reeds, in all the\ntroughs: the remainder of the composition strow over all the fire-\nroom, and then lay your bavins loose Cast off all the covers of the fire-barrels, and hang the quick-match\nloose over their sides, and place leaders of quick-match from the reeds\ninto the barrels, and from thence into the vent of the chambers, in\nsuch a manner as to be certain of their blowing open the ports, and\nsetting fire to the barrels Two troughs of communication from each\ndoor of the fire-room to the sally-ports, must be laid with a strong\nleader of quick-match, four or five times double: also a cross-piece to\ngo from the sally-port, when the ship is fired, to the communication\ntrough, laid with leaders of quick-match, that the fire may be\ncommunicated to both sides at once What quick-match is left, place so that the fire may be\ncommunicated to all parts of the room at once, especially about the\nports and fire-barrels, and see that the chambers are well and fresh\nprimed N B The port-fires[29] used for firing the ship, burns about twelve\nminutes Great care must be taken to have no powder on board when\nthe ship is fired The sheer-hooks represented by fig 3, plate IV are fitted so as to\nfasten on the yard-arms of the fire-ship, where they hook the enemies\n\n\nrigging The fire-grapplings, fig 4, are either fixed on the yard-arms,\nor thrown by hand, having a chain to confine the ships together, or\nfasten those instruments wherever necessary When the commanding officer of a fleet displays the signal to\nprepare for action, the fire-ships fix their sheer-hooks, and dispose\ntheir grapplings in readiness The battle being begun, they proceed\nimmediately to prime, and prepare their fire-works When they are\nready for grappling, they inform the admiral thereof by a particular\nsignal To avoid being disabled by the enemy’s cannon during a general\nengagement, the fire-ships continue sufficiently distant from their line\nof battle, either to windward or to leeward They cautiously shun the openings, or intervals, of the line, where\nthey would be directly exposed to the enemy’s fire, from which they\nare covered by lying on the opposite side of their own ships They are\nattentively to observe the signals of the admiral, or his seconds, in\norder to put their designs immediately in execution Although no ship of the line should be previously appointed to\nprotect any fire-ship, except a few of the smallest particularly destined\nto this service, yet the ship before whom she passes in order to\napproach the enemy, should escort her thither, and assist her with an\narmed boat, or whatever succour may be necessary in her situation[30] The captain of the fire-ship should himself be particularly attentive\nthat the above instructions are punctually executed, and that the\nyards may be so braced, when he falls along-side of the ship intended\nto be destroyed, that the sheer-hooks and grapplings fastened to the\nyardarms, &c may effectually hook the enemy He is expected to be\nthe last person who quits the vessel, and being furnished with every\nnecessary assistance and support, his reputation will greatly depend\non the success of his enterprise FISH, a machine employed to hoist or draw up the flukes of the\nship’s anchor towards the top of the bow in order to stow it, after\nhaving been heaved up by the cable It is composed of four parts, viz the pendant, the block, the hook, and the tackle; which, together with\ntheir several uses, are described in the article Davit Fish, jumelle, is also a long piece of oak, convex on one side, and\nconcave on the other It is used to fasten upon the outside of the lower\nmasts, either as an additional security, to strengthen them when it\nbecomes necessary to carry an extraordinary pressure of sail, in\npursuit of, or flight from, an enemy, or to reinforce them after they\n\n\nhave received some damage in battle, tempestuous weather, &c The fishes are also employed for the same purpose on any yard,\nwhich happens to be sprung or fractured Thus their form, application,\nand utility are exactly like those of the splinters applied to a broken\nlimb in surgery FISH-GIG, foesne, an instrument used to strike fish at sea,\nparticularly dolphins It consists of a staff, three or four barbed\nprongs, and a line fastened to the end, on which the prongs are fixed:\nto the other end is fitted a piece of lead, which serves to give\nadditional force to the stroke when the weapon flies, and to turn the\npoints upward after the fish is penetrated FITTING-OUT, equiper, the act of providing a ship with a sufficient\nnumber of men, to navigate and arm her for attack or defence: also to\nfurnish her with proper masts, sails, yards, ammunition, artillery,\ncordage, anchors, and other naval furniture; together with sufficient\nprovisions for the ship’s company FLAG, pavillon, (flag, Dutch) a certain banner or standard, by which\nan admiral is distinguished at sea from the inferior ships of his\nsquadron; also the colours by which one nation is distinguished from\nanother In the British navy flags are either red, white, or blue, and are\ndisplayed from the top of the main-mast, fore-mast, or mizen-mast,\naccording to the rank of the admiral The first flag in Great Britain is the royal standard, which is only to\nbe hoisted when the king or queen are aboard the vessel: the second is\nthat of the anchor of hope, which characterizes the lord high admiral,\nor lords commissioners of the admiralty: and the third is the union\nflag, in which the crosses of St George and St Andrew are blended",
    "Andrew are blended This last is appropriated to the admiral of the fleet, who is the first\nmilitary officer under the lord high admiral When a flag is displayed from the flag-staff on the main-mast, the\nofficer distinguished thereby, is known to be an admiral; when from\nthe fore-mast, a vice-admiral; and when from the mizen-mast, a rear-\nadmiral The next flag after the union is that of the white squadron, at the\nmain-mast, and the last, which characterizes an admiral, is the blue,\nat the same mast-head For a vice-admiral, the first flag is the red; the second, the white;\nthe third, the blue, at the flag-staff on the fore-mast The same order proceeds with regard to the rear-admirals, whose\n\n\nflags are hoisted on the top of the mizen-mast: the lowest flag in our\nnavy is accordingly the blue on the mizen-mast FLAG-OFFICER, a term synonimous to admiral FLAG-SHIP, the ship on which any flag is displayed FLAG-STAFF, baton, a pole erected at the head of a top-gallant-\nmast, or top-mast, whereon to hoist and display the flag or pendant FLAKE, echafaud, a sort of scaffold or platform, formed of hurdles\nand supported by stanchions, and used for drying cod-fish in\nNewfoundland These flakes are usually placed near the shores of\nfishing-harbours FLAT, plain, a level ground lying at a small depth under the surface\nof the sea, and otherwise called a shoal or shallow To Flat-in, the action of drawing in the aftmost lower-corner, or\nclue of a sail towards the middle of the ship, to give the sail the\ngreater power of turning the vessel Thus if the mizen, or after-sails\nare flatted-in, it is evident that the intention is to carry the stern to\nleeward, and turn the head nearer to the direction of the wind: and if\nthe head-sails are slatted-in, the intention is accordingly to make the\nship fall off, when by design or accident she has come so near the\nwind as to make the sails shiver Hence\nFlat-in forward, traverse misaine, is the order to draw in the fore-\nsheet, jib-sheet, and fore-stay-sail-sheet, towards the middle of the\nship This operation is seldom performed, except in light breezes of\nwind, when the helm has not sufficient government of the ship FLEET, vaisseaux du roi, (flota, Sax ) a general name given to his\nmajesty’s navy, or to any part thereof destined on a particular\nenterprise or expedition: also a convoy or company of merchant ships,\nflotte, conserve, with or without ships of war to defend them The admirals of his majesty’s fleet are classed into three squadrons,\nviz the red, the white, and the blue When any of these officers are\ninvested with the command of a squadron or detachment of men of\nwar, the particular ships are distinguished by the colours of their\nrespective squadron: that is to say, the ships of the red squadron wear\nan ensign, whose union is displayed on a red field; the ensigns of the\nwhite squadron have a white field; and those of the blue squadron, a\nblue field; the union being common to all three The ships of war\ntherefore are occasionally annexed to any of the three squadrons, or\nshifted from one to another Of whatsoever number a fleet of ships of war is composed, it is\nusually divided into three squadrons; and these, if numerous, are\n\n\nagain separated into divisions The admiral, or principal officer,\ncommands the centre; the vice-admiral, or second in command,\nsuperintends the van-guard; and the operations of the rear are\ndirected by the rear-admiral, or the officer next in rank See the article\nDivision The disposition of a fleet, while proceeding on a voyage, will in\nsome measure depend on particular circumstances; as the difficulty of\nthe navigation; the necessity of dispatch, according to the urgency or\nimportance of the expedition; or the expectation of an enemy in the\npassage The most convenient order is probably to range it into three\nlines or columns, each of which is parallel to a line close-hauled\naccording to the tack, on which the line of battle is designed to be\nformed This arrangement is more used than any, because it contains\nthe advantages of every other form, without their inconveniences The\nfleet being thus more inclosed, will more readily observe the signals,\nand with greater facility form itself into the line of battle; a\ncircumstance which should be kept in view in every order of sailing FLEETING, the act of changing the situation of a tackle, when the\nblocks are drawn together; or what is called block and block by sailors The use of fleeting is accordingly to replace the mechanical powers\ninto a state of action; the force by which they operated before being\ndestroyed by the meeting of the blocks or pullies Fleeting therefore is nearly similar to the winding up of a watch or\nclock See the article Tackle FLOAT, a raft, or quantity of timber fastened together across, to be\nwafted along a river with the tide or current FLOATING, (flotter, Fr ) the state of being borne up, or wafted along\nwith the tide on the surface of the water, the theory of which is\nexplained in the article Trim FLOOR, the bottom of a ship; or all that part on each side of the\nkeel, which approaches nearer to an horizontal, than a perpendicular\nsituation, and whereon she rests when aground Thus it is common to\nsay, a sharp floor, a flat floor, a long floor, &c Whence\nFloor-timbers, varangues, are those parts of the ship’s timbers\nwhich are placed immediately across the keel, and upon which the\nbottom of the ship is framed: to these the upper parts of the timbers\nare united, being only a continuation of floor-timbers upwards See\nNaval Architecture FLOWING, the position of the sheets, or lower corners of the\nprincipal sails, when they are loosened to the wind, so as to receive it\n\n\ninto their cavities in a direction more nearly perpendicular than when\nthey are close-hauled, although more obliquely than when the vessel is\nsailing before the wind A ship is therefore said to have a flowing sheet when the wind\ncrosses the line of her course nearly at right angles: that is to say, a\nship steering due north, with the wind at east, or directly on her side,\nwill have a flowing sheet; whereas if the sheets were extended close\naft, she would sail two points nearer the wind, viz N N E See the\narticles Close-hauled, Large, and Trim FLY of an ensign, battant, the breadth or extent from the staff to the\nextremity or edge that flutters loose in the wind FLY-BOAT, or FLIGHT, a large flat-bottomed Dutch vessel, whose\nburthen is generally from four to six hundred tons It is distinguished\nby a stern remarkably high, resembling a Gothic turret, and by very\nbroad buttocks below Plate v FOOT of a sail, fond de voile, lower edge or bottom Foot-rope, the rope to which the foot of a sail is sewed See Bolt-\nRope Foot-ropes are also the same with horses of the yards See that\narticle FOOT-WALEING, the whole inside planks or lining of a ship, used\nto prevent any part of the ballast or cargo from falling between the\nfloor-timbers See Midship-Frame FORE, the distinguishing character of all that part of a ship’s frame\nand machinery which lies near the stem Fore and Aft, throughout the ship’s whole length, or from end to\nend Fore Bowline, the bowline of the fore-sail See Bowline Fore-castle, gaillard d’avant, a short deck placed in the fore part\nof the ship, above the upper deck It is usually terminated, both before\nand behind, by a breast-work in vessels of war; the foremost end\nforming the top of the beak-head, and the hind part reaching to the\nafter part of the fore-chains Fore-cat-harpings, a complication of ropes used to brace in the\nupper part of the fore-shrouds See Cat-harpings Fore-foot, brion, a piece of timber which terminates the keel at\nthe fore end It is connected by a scarf to the extremity of the keel, of\nwhich it makes a part: and the other end of it, which is incurvated\nupwards into a sort of knee or crotch, is attached to the lower end of\nthe stem, of which it also makes a part, being also called the gripe As the lower arm of the fore-foot lies on the same level with the\nkeel, so the upper one coincides with the middle line of the stem: its\nbreadth and thickness therefore correspond to the dimensions of those\npieces, and the heel of the cut-water is scarfed to its upper end The form of this piece, and its disposition and connexion with the\nadjacent pieces, appears by the letter i, in plate I Pieces of the\nHull Fore-Hooks, the same with breast-hooks, which see Foreland, a cape or promontory projecting into the sea;

to this is fastened a long pole, by\nwhich it is plunged repeatedly in the water, as close as possible to the\nplace where the leak is conjectured to lie The oakum, or chopped\nrope-yarns, being thus gradually shaken through the twigs, or over the\ntop of the basket, are frequently sucked into the hole along with the\nwater, so that the leak becomes immediately choaked, and the future\nentrance of the water is thereby prevented FOUL, empecheé, as a sea-term, is generally used in opposition to\nclear, and implies intangled, embarrassed, or contrary, in the\nfollowing senses:\n\n\nA ship ran foul of us in the river, i e entangled herself amongst our\nrigging",
    "entangled herself amongst our\nrigging Foul, when expressed of a ship’s bottom, denotes that it is very\ndirty; as being covered with grass, sea-weeds, shells, or other filth\nwhich gathers to it during the course of a long voyage When\nunderstood of the ground or bottom of a road, bay, sea-coast, or\nharbour, mal sain, it signifies rocky, or abounding with shallows, or\notherwise dangerous When spoken of the hawse, it means that the cables are turned\nround each other, by the winding or turning about of the ship while\nshe rides at anchor See Elbow and Hawse Foul, when applied to the wind, is used to express that it is\nunfavourable, or contrary to the ship’s course, as opposed to large or\nfair To FOUNDER, sancir, to sink at sea, as being rendered, by the\nviolence and continuation of a storm, and the excess of the leaks,\nunable to keep the ship afloat above the water FOX, a sort of strand, formed by twisting several rope-yarns\ntogether, and used as a seizing, or to weave a mat or paunch, &c FRAME See Timber FRAPPING, the act of crossing and drawing together the several\nparts of a tackle, or other complication of ropes, which had already\nbeen straitened to their utmost extent: in this sense it exactly\nresembles the operation of bracing up a drum, &c The frapping\nalways increases the tension, and of course adds to the security\nacquired by the purchase Hence the cat-harpings are no other than\nfrappings to the shrouds Frapping a ship, ceintrer, the act of passing three, four, or five turns\nof a cable round the hull, or frame of a ship, in the middle, to support\nher in a great storm, when it is apprehended that she is not strong\nenough to resist the violent efforts of the sea This expedient however\nis rarely put in practice, unless in very old ships, which their owners\nare willing to venture to sea as long as possible, by ensuring them\ndeeply FREEING, affranchir, the act of pumping, or otherwise throwing out\nthe water which has leaked into a ship’s bottom at sea, &c FREEZING, a sort of ornamental painting on the upper part of a\nship’s quarter, stern, or bow It consists generally of armour,\ninstruments of war, marine emblems, &c FREIGHT, or fraight of a ship (affretement) the hire, or a part thereof,\n\n\nusually paid for the carriage and conveyance of goods; or the sum\nagreed, upon between the owner and the merchant for the hire and\nuse of a vessel Freight also implies the lading or cargo which she has aboard FRESH, when applied to the wind, generally signifies strong, but\nnot violent or dangerous: hence when the gale increases, it is said to\nfreshen To FRESHEN the hawse, refraichir, to relieve that part of the cable\nwhich for some time has been exposed to the friction in one of the\nhawse-holes, produced by the rocking and pitching of a ship as she\nrides at anchor in a high sea When a ship remains in such a situation, it is always necessary to\nwrap some old canvas, mat, leather, or such like material, round that\npart of the cable which rubs against the stem, &c The matter used for\nthis purpose is called service: but as the violent agitation of the ship,\nproduced by the tempest, or sea, as she rides in an open road, must\ncommunicate a great friction to the cable, the service will\nconsequently be soon worn through: it is necessary therefore to have\nit frequently renewed by a fresh application of the like materials,\nbehind the former, for the preservation of the cable, on which every\nthing depends; and this renewal of service is called freshening the\nhawse, a circumstance which cannot be too vigilantly observed FRESHES, souberme, imply the impetuosity of an ebb-tide, increased\nby heavy rains, and flowing out into the sea, which it often discolours\nto a considerable distance from the shore; inasmuch as the line, which\ndivides the two colours, may be perceived distinctly for a great length\nalong the coast FRIGATE, (fregate, Fr ) in the navy, a light nimble ship built for the\npurposes of sailing swiftly These vessels mount from twenty to thirty-\neight guns, and are esteemed excellent cruizers Frigate-built, fregaté, implies the disposition of the decks of such\nmerchant ships as have a descent of four or five steps from the\nquarter-deck and fore-castle into the waist, in contra-distinction to those\nwhose decks are on a continued line for the whole length of the ship,\nwhich are called galley-built See the article Flush Formerly the name of frigate was only known in the Mediterranean,\nand applied to a kind of long vessel, navigated in that sea with sails\nand oars The English were the first who appeared on the ocean with\nthose ships, and equipped them for war as well as commerce FULL AND BY, pres & plein, the situation of a ship with regard to the\n\n\nwind, when she is close-hauled, and sailing in such a manner as\nneither to steer too nigh the direction of the wind, nor to deviate to\nleeward; both of which movements are unfavourable to her course, as\nin the former her sails will shiver, and render the effort of the wind\nprecarious and ineffectual; and in the latter she will advance in a\ndirection widely distant from her real course Hence, keep her full defie du vent is the order from the pilot or other officer to the\nhelmsman, not to incline too much to windward, and thereby shake\nthe sails so as to retard the course FURLING, (ferler, Fr ) the operation of wrapping or rolling a sail\nclose up to the yard, stay, or mast to which it belongs, and winding a\ngasket or cord about it to fasten it thereto And hence\nFURLING-LINE denotes a cord employed in this office: those which\nare used for the larger sails are generally flat, and are known by the\nname of gaskets FUTTOCKS, the middle division of a ship’s timbers; or those parts\nwhich are situated between the floor and the top-timbers See this\nfully explained in the article Timber As the epithet hooked is frequently applied in common language to\nany thing bent or incurvated, and particularly to several crooked\ntimbers in a ship, as the breast-hooks, fore-hooks, after-hooks, &c this\nterm is evidently derived from the lowest part or foot of the timber,\nand from the shape of the piece Hence\nFuttock-Shrouds, or rather Foot-hook Shrouds See the article\nShrouds G GAFF, a sort of boom or pole, frequently used in small ships, to extend\nthe upper edge of the mizen; and always employed for the same\npurpose on those sails whose foremost edges are joined to the mast by\nhoops or lacings, and which are usually extended by a boom below Such are the main-sails of all sloops, brigs, and schooners The foremost, or inner extremity of the gaff, is furnished with two\ncheeks forming a semi-circle, which incloses the after-part of the mast\nso as to confine the gaff close to its respective mast whilst the sail is\nhoisting or lowering It is further secured in this situation by a rope\npassing from one of the cheeks to the other on the fore side of the\nmast; and to prevent the friction of this rope upon the mast, by\nhoisting or lowering, several little wooden balls, called trucks, are\nhung upon it, in the same manner as the holy beads are hung upon a\ncatholic’s rosary GAGE See Weather-Gage To GAIN the wind, in navigation, gagner au vent, to arrive on the\nweather-side, or to windward of, some other vessel in sight, when\nboth are plying to windward, or sailing as near the wind as possible GALE of wind, a phrase used by sailors to express a storm or\ntempest It is more particularly termed a hard gale, or strong gale GALEON, a name formerly given to ships of war, furnished with\nthree or four batteries of cannon It is now retained only by the\nSpaniards, and applied to the largest size of their merchant ships,\nemployed on West-Indian voyages, and usually furnished with four\ndecks They likewise bestow the same name on those vessels, whether\ngreat or small, which proceed annually to La Vera Cruz The\nPortugueze also have several ships which they send to India and the\nBrazils, nearly resembling the galeons, and by them called caragues GALLED, raqué, the state of a mast, yard, cable, or other rope, when\nit is deprived of the surface, and chafed by friction To preserve those\narticles from being damaged by this effect, it is therefore usual to\ncover them with skins, mats, canvas, or such materials, in the places\nwhere they are the most exposed to it by the rocking of the vessel See\nthe article Service GALLERY, a balcony projecting from the stern or quarter of a ship of\nwar, or large merchantman In the former, the stern-gallery is usually\ndecorated with a ballustrade, extending from one side of the ship to\n\n\nthe other; the fore-part is limited by a partition called the skreen-bulk\nhead, in which are framed the cabin windows; and the roof of it is\nformed by a sort of vault, termed the cove, which is frequently\nornamented with sculpture See Stern The quarter gallery of a ship of 74 guns is represented at large, in\nthe plate referred to from the article Quarter GALLEY, galere, a kind of low flat-built vessel, furnished with one\ndeck, and navigated with sails and oars, particularly in the\nMediterranean The largest sort of these vessels, galeasse, is employed only by the\nVenetians They are commonly 162 feet long above, and 133 feet by\nthe keel; 32 feet wide, with 23 feet length of stern-post They are\nfurnished with three masts, and thirty-two banks of oars; every bank\ncontaining two oars, and every oar being managed by six or seven\nslaves, who are usually chained thereto In the fore-part they have\nthree little batteries of cannon, of which the lowest is of two 36\npounders, the second of two 24 pounders, and the uppermost of two 2\npounders: three 18 pounders are also planted on each quarter The\ncompliment of men for one of these galleys is generally 1000 or 1200 They are esteemed extremely convenient for bombarding or making a\ndescent upon an enemy’s coast, as drawing but little water; and\nhaving by their oars frequently the advantage of a ship of war, in light\nwinds or calms, by cannonading the latter near the surface of the\nwater; by scouring her whole length with their shot, and at the same\ntime keeping on her quarter or bow, so as to be out of the direction of\nher cannon The gallies next in size to these, which are also called half-gallies,\nare from 120 to 130 feet long, 18 feet broad, and 9 or 10 feet deep They have two masts, which may be struck at pleasure, and are\nfurnished with two large lateen sails, and five pieces of cannon They\nhave commonly 25 banks of oars, as described above A size still less\nthan these are called quarter-gallies, carrying from twelve to sixteen\nbanks of oars There are very few gallies now besides those in the\nMediterranean, which are found by experience to be of little utility,\nexcept in fine weather; a circumstance which renders their service\nextremely precarious They generally keep close under the shore, but\nsometimes venture out to sea to perform a summer cruise See the\narticles Quarter and Vessel GAMMONING, lieure, a rope used to bind the inner quarter of the\nbowsprit close down to the ship’s stem, in order to enable it the better\n\n\nto support the stays of the fore-mast, and carry sail in the fore part of\nthe vessel Seven or eight turns of this rope, fig 7 plate IV are passed\nover the bowsprit A, and through a large hole in the stem or knee of\nthe head Y alternately: after all the turns are drawn as firm as\npossible, the opposite ones are braced together under the bowsprit by\na frapping, as exhibited in the same figure GANG, a select number of a ship’s crew appointed on any particular\nservice, and commanded by an officer suitable to the occasion GANG-BOARD, planche, a board or plank with several cleats or steps\nnailed upon it for the convenience of walking into, or out of, a boat\nupon the shore, where the water is not deep enough to float the boat\nclose to the landing-place GANGWAY, passe-avant, a narrow platform, or range of planks, laid\nhorizontally along the upper part of a ship’s side, from the quarter-\ndeck to the forecastle, for the convenience of walking more\nexpeditiously, fore and aft, than by descending into the waist This\nplatform is therefore peculiar to ships which are deep-waisted It is\nfenced on the outside by several small iron pillars, and a rope\nextended from one to the other; and sometimes by a netting, to\nprevent any one from falling off into the sea when the ship is in\nmotion This is frequently called the gang-board in merchant vessels Gangway, echelle, is also that part of a ship’s side, both within and\nwithout, by which the passengers enter and depart It is for this\npurpose provided with a sufficient number of steps, or cleats, nailed\nupon the ship’s side, nearly as low as the surface of the water; and\nsometimes furnished with a railed accommodation-ladder, whose\nlower end projects from the ship’s side, being secured in this position\nby iron braces, so as to render the ascent and descent extremely\nconvenient Gangway, accoursie, is likewise used to signify a passage left in the\nhold, when a ship is laden, in order to arrive at any particular place\ntherein, occasionally; as to examine the situation of the provisions or\ncargo; to discover and stop a leak; or to bring out any article required\nfor service; &c Finally, a gangway implies a thoroughfare, or narrow\npassage of any kind GARLAND, a sort of net, whose opening is extended by a wooden\nhoop of sufficient size to admit a bowl or platter within it It is\naccordingly used by the sailors as a locker or cupboard to contain\ntheir provisions, being hung up to the deck within the birth, where\nthey commonly mess between-decks Shot-Garland, epitie, a piece of timber nailed horizontally along\nthe ship’s side from one gun-port to another, and used to contain the\nround-shot ready for charging the great guns in battle For this\npurpose it is furnished with several semi-globular cavities,\ncorresponding to the size of the cannon-balls which it is employed to\ncontain GARNET, garant, a sort of tackle fixed to the main-stay of a\nmerchant ship, and used to hoist in and out the goods of which the\ncargo is composed Garnet is also a small tackle fastened to the clues or lower corners\nof the main-sail or fore-sail, for the purpose of trussing up those sails,\nas occasion requires; and hence it is called Clue-Garnet, which see GARBOARD-STREAK, gabord, in ship-building, the first range or\nstreak of planks laid upon a ship’s bottom next to the keel, throughout\nthe whole length of the floor The edge of this plank is let into a\ngroove or channel in the side of the keel, which is called the rabbit of\nthe garboard-streak GASKET, garcet, a sort of platted cord fastened to the sail-yards of a\nship, and used to furl or tie up the sail firmly to the yard This is\nperformed by wrapping the gasket round the yard and sail six or\nseven times, the turns being at a competent distance from each other GAUNTLOPE, pronounced gauntlet, a race which a criminal is\nsentenced to run in a vessel of war, as a punishment for felony, or\nsome other heinous offence It is executed in the following manner: the whole ship’s crew is\ndisposed in two rows, standing face to face on both sides of the deck,\nso as to form a lane, whereby to go forward on one side, and return aft\non the other; each person being furnished with a small twisted cord,\ncalled a knittle, having two or three knots upon it The delinquent is\nthen stripped naked above the waist, and ordered to pass forward\nbetween the two rows of men, and aft on the other side, a certain\nnumber of times, rarely exceeding three; during which every person\ngives him a stripe as he runs along In his passage through this painful\nordeal he is sometimes tripped up, and very severely handled while\nincapable of proceeding This punishment, which is called running the\ngauntlet, courir la bouline, is seldom inflicted except for such crimes as\nwill naturally excite a general antipathy amongst the seamen;

so that as she veers, or\nendeavours to swing about, her side bears upon one of the cables,\nwhich catches on her heel, and interrupts her in the act of traversing In this position she must ride with her broadside or stern to the wind\nor current, till one or both of the cables are slackened so as to sink\nunder the keel;

as, “He has\nanchored in our hause;” the “brig fell athwart our hause,” &c A ship is said to ride with a clear hause, when the cables are\ndirected to their anchors, without lying athwart the stem; or crossing,\nor being twisted round each other, by the ships winding about,\naccording to the change of the wind, tide, or current A foul hause, on the contrary, implies that the cables lie across the\nstem, or bear upon each other, so as to be rubbed and chafed by the\nmotion of the vessel The hause accordingly is foul, by having either a cross, an elbow, or\na round turn If the larboard cable, lying across the stem, points out\non the starboard side, while the starboard cable at the same time\ngrows out on the larboard side, there is a cross in the hause If, after\nthis, the ship, without returning to her former position, continues to\nwind about the same way, so as to perform an entire revolution, each\nof the cables will be twisted round the other, and then directed out\nfrom the opposite bow, forming what is called a round turn An elbow\nis produced when the ship stops in the middle of that revolution, after\nhaving had a cross: or, in other words, if she rides with her head\nnorthward with a clear hause, and afterwards turns quite round so as\nto direct her head northward again, she will have an elbow See the\narticles Elbow and Riding Hause-holes, ecubiers, certain cylindrical holes cut through the\nbows of a ship on each side of the item, through which the cables pass\n\n\nin order to be drawn into, or let out of the vessel, as occasion\nrequires They are represented by d d in fig 10 plate IV being\nfortified on each side by the\nHause-pieces, a name given to the foremost timbers of a ship,\nwhose lower ends rest upon the knuckle-timber, or the foremost of the\ncant-timbers They are generally parallel to the stem, having their\nupper ends sometimes terminated by the lower part of the beak-head,\nand otherwise, by the top of the bow, particularly in small ships and\nmerchantmen HEAD, an ornamental figure erected on the continuation of a ship’s\nstem, as being expressive of her name, and emblematical of war,\nnavigation, commerce, &c The heads which have any affinity to war or navigation, are in\ngeneral either historical, as referring to some of the deities or heroes\nof antiquity; or allegorical, as alluding to some of the natural\nconsequences of battle, or the virtues most essential to a life exposed\nto perpetual danger Thus, in the former sense, they represent a\nNeptune, an Alcides; a Mars, an Achilles; a Minerva, or a Jason; and\nin the latter they produce a Magnanime, an Intrepid, a Revenge, or a\nVictory The head of a ship however has not always an immediate relation\nto her name, at least in the British navy Various instances might be\nproduced to shew, that our artists, as it suits their conveniency or\njudgment, can dispense with this supposed idea of propriety Hence\nwe sometimes observe the place of a Jason supplied by a Medea; or a\nbest of prey made the representative of an illustrious lady The same\nliberty of design may therefore, with equal propriety, be allowed to\nsymbolize the successes of our arms, by a groupe of heterogeneous\nfigures, of sundry shapes and sizes, according to the artists opinion of\ntheir superiority or subordination Their attitude and situation, as well\nas their size, must accordingly depend, in a great measure, on the\nspace into which they are to be crowded: for although the figures may\nbe of equal importance in themselves, yet as there is not room for\nthem all, as large as the life, on a ship’s head, it becomes expedient to\ndiminish a few, in order to give place to others The emblems by\nwhich allegorical figures are usually characterized in painting, poetry,\nand sculpture, are not always thought necessary in a work of this\nkind, nor even the postures in which these figures are exhibited And\nindeed, if we reflect with how much labour and application the\nworkman has endeavoured to fill up every vacancy with some little\n\n\nfigure of a convenient form and size, we ought rather to admire his\ningenuity than censure him for a violation of those general rules of\nart, by which it is supposed necessary, on such occasions, to relieve\nthe eye from a scene of perplexity and confusion The heads of many of our ships of war have undoubtedly great\nbeauty and propriety; and candour must acknowledge that some of\nthe most elegant and judicious have been borrowed from the French\ndesigns, which are never left to the invention of illiterate mechanics A multitude of ornaments appears rather unnecessary in any building\ncalculated for the purposes of war If there be any general rule to\ndetermine the subjects, and the quantity of sculpture employed in\nship-building, it seems to be connected with the ideas of dignity and\nsimplicity These too are the genuine characteristics of the Grecian\nand Roman orders of architecture, as opposed to that perplexity, and\nrage for embellishment, which peculiarly distinguish the Gothic It is\nhardly possible for us to recollect the various disasters to which a\nsingle hero, or goddess, on the head of a ship, is exposed by\ntempestuous weather, battle, and the unexpected encounter of ships,\nwithout trembling for the havoc and indecency that may happen in an\nassemblage of gods and conc-shells, princesses and satyrs; heroes,\nblunder-buffes, sea-monsters, little children, globes and thunder-bolts,\nand all the apparatus necessary to constitute the head of a ship of the\nfirst class in our navy In plate IV we have sketched four heads, which are calculated for\nvessels of different sizes and constructions Fig 6 exhibits an image of\nHercules brandishing his club over the heads of Cerberus, calculated\nfor a ship of the line Fig 7 represents Jupiter riding on his eagle, and\narmed with his thunders, being a suitable head for a capital ship The\neagle displayed by fig 8 may serve for a frigate;

and this fluid pushes it towards the\nopposite side, whilst it is retained in this position: so that the stern, to\nwhich the rudder is confined, receives the same impression, and\naccordingly turns from B to b about some point c whilst the head of\nthe ship passes from A to a It must be observed, that the current of\nwater falls upon the rudder obliquely, and only strikes it with that\npart of its motion which acts according to the sine of incidence,\npushing it in the direction N P, with a force which not only depends\non the velocity of the ship’s course, by which this current of water is\nproduced, but also upon the extent of the sine of incidence This force\nis by consequence composed of the square of the velocity with which\nthe ship advances, and the square of the sine of incidence, which will\nnecessarily be greater or smaller according to circumstances; so that if\nthe vessel runs three or four times more swiftly, the absolute shock of\nthe water upon the rudder will be nine or sixteen times stronger under\nthe same incidence: and, if the incidence is increased, it will yet be\naugmented in a greater proportion, because the square of the sine of\nincidence is more enlarged This impression, or, what is the same\nthing, the power of the helm, is always very feeble, when compared\nwith the weight of the vessel; but as it operates with the force of a\nlong lever, its efforts to turn the ship are extremely advantageous For\nthe helm being applied to a great distance from the centre of gravity,\nG, or from the point about which the vessel turns horizontally, if the\ndirection P N of the impression of the water upon the rudder be\nprolonged, it is evident that it will pass perpendicularly to R, widely\ndistant from the centre of gravity G: thus the absolute effort of the\nwater is very powerful It is not therefore surprizing that this machine\nimpresses the ship with a considerable circular movement, by pushing\nthe stern from B to b, and the head from A to a; and even much\nfarther, whilst the sails with rapidity: because the effect of the helm\nalways keeps pace with the velocity with which the vessel\nadvances[31] Amongst the several angles that the rudder makes with the keel,\nthere is always one position more favourable than any of the others,\nas it more readily produces the desired effect of turning the ship, in\norder to change her course To ascertain this, it must be considered,\nthat if the obliquity of the rudder with the keel is greater than the\nobtuse angle A B D, so as to diminish that angle, the action of the\nwater upon the rudder will increase, and at the same time oppose the\ncourse of the ship in a greater degree; because the angle of incidence\nwill be more open, so as to present a greater surface to the shock of\nthe water, by opposing its passage more perpendicularly But at that\ntime the direction N P of the effort of the helm upon the ship will\npass, with a smaller distance from the centre of gravity G towards R,\nand less approach the perpendicular N L, according to which it is\nabsolutely necessary that the power applied should act with a greater\neffect to turn the vessel Thus it is evident that if the obtuse angle A B\nD is too much enclosed, the greatest impulse of the water will not\ncounterbalance the loss sustained by the distance of the direction N P\nfrom N L; or by the great obliquity, which is given to the same\ndirection N P of the absolute effort of the helm with the keel A B If,\non the contrary, the angle A B D is too much opened, the direction N\nP of the force of action of the helm will become more advantageous to\nturn the vessel, because it will approach nearer the perpendicular N L;\nso that the line prolonged from N P will increase the line G R, by\nremoving R to a greater distance from the centre of gravity G: but\nthen the helm will receive the impression of the water too obliquely,\nfor the angle of incidence will be more acute; so that it will only\npresent a small portion of its breadth to the shock of the water, and\nby consequence will only receive a feeble effort By this principle it is\neasy to conceive, that the greatest distance G R from the centre of\ngravity G is not sufficient to repair the diminution of force occasioned\nby the too great obliquity of the shock of the water Hence we may\nconclude, that when the water either strikes the helm too directly, or\ntoo obliquely, it loses a great deal of the effect it ought to produce Between the two extremes there is therefore a mean position, which is\nthe most favourable to its operations The diagonal N P of the rectangle I L represents the absolute\ndirection of the effort of the water upon the helm N I expresses the\nportion of this effort which is opposed to the ship’s head-way, or\nwhich pushes her astern, in a direction parallel to the keel It is easily\nperceived that this part N I of the whole power of the helm\n\n\ncontributes but little to turn the vessel; for if I N is prolonged, it\nappears that its direction approaches to a very small distance G V\nfrom the centre of gravity G, and that the arm of the lever B N=G V,\nto which the force is applied, is not in the whole more than equal to\nhalf the breadth of the rudder: but the relative force N L, which acts\nperpendicular to the keel, is extremely different If the first N I is\nalmost useless, and even pernicious, by retarding the velocity; the\nsecond N L is capable of a very great effect, because it operates at a\nconsiderable distance from the centre of gravity G of the ship, and\nacts upon the arm of a lever G E, which is very long Thus it appears,\nthat between the effects N L and N I, which result from the absolute\neffort N P, there is one which always opposes the ship’s course, and\ncontributes little to her motion of turning; whilst the other produces\nonly this movement of rotation, without operating to retard her\nvelocity[32] Geometricians have determined the most advantageous angle made\nby the helm with the line prolonged from the keel, and fixed it at 54°\n44´ presuming that the ship is as narrow at her floating-line, or at the\nline described by the surface of the water round her bottom, as at the\nkeel But as this supposition is absolutely false, inasmuch as all vessels\naugment their breadth from the keel upward to the extreme breadth,\nwhere the floating-line or the highest water-line is terminated; it\nfollows that this angle is too large by a certain number of degrees For\nthe rudder is impressed by the water, at the height of the floating-line,\nmore directly than at the keel, because the fluid exactly follows the\nhorizontal outlines of the bottom; so that a particular position of the\nhelm might be supposed necessary for each different incidence which\nit encounters from the keel upwards But as a middle position may be\ntaken between all these points, it will be sufficient to consider the\nangle formed by the sides of the ship, and her axis, or the middle-line\nof her length, at the surface of the water, in order to determine\nafterwards the mean point, and the mean angle of incidence It is evident that the angle 54° 44´ is too open, and very\nunfavourable to the ship’s head-way, because the water acts upon the\nrudder there with too great a sine of incidence, as being equal to that\nof the angle which it makes with the line prolonged from the keel\nbelow: but above, the shock of the water is almost perpendicular to\nthe rudder, because of the breadth of the bottom, as we have already\nremarked If then the rudder is only opposed to the fluid, by making\nan angle of 45° with the line prolonged from the keel, the impression,\nby becoming weaker, will be less opposed to the ship’s head-way, and\nthe direction N P, fig",
    "If then the rudder is only opposed to the fluid, by making\nan angle of 45° with the line prolonged from the keel, the impression,\nby becoming weaker, will be less opposed to the ship’s head-way, and\nthe direction N P, fig 1 plate V of the absolute effort of the water\nupon the helm drawing nearer to the lateral perpendicular, will be\nplaced more advantageously, for the reasons above mentioned[33] On\nthe other hand, experience daily testifies, that a ship steers well when\nthe rudder makes the angle D B E equal to 35° only It has been already remarked, that the effect of moving the wheel to\ngovern the helm increases in proportion to the length of the spokes;\nand so great is the power of the wheel, that if the helmsman employs\na force upon its spokes equivalent to 30 pounds, it will produce an\neffect of 90 or 120 pounds upon the tiller On the contrary, the action\nof the water is collected into the middle of the breadth of the rudder,\nwhich is very narrow in companion with the length of the tiller; so the\neffort of the water is very little removed from the fulcrum B upon\nwhich it turns; whereas the tiller forms the arm of a lever ten or\n\n\nfifteen times longer, which also increases the power of the helmsman\nin the same proportion that the tiller bears to the lever upon which\nthe impulse of the water is directed This force then is by consequence\nten or fifteen times stronger, and the effort of 30 pounds, which at\nfirst gave the helmsman a power equal to 90 or 120 pounds, becomes\naccumulated to one of 900 or 1800 pounds upon the rudder This\nadvantage then arises from the shortness of the lever upon which the\naction of the water is impressed, and the great comparative length of\nthe tiller, or lever, by which the rudder is governed; together with the\nadditional power of the wheel that directs the movements of the tiller,\nand still farther accumulates the power of the helmsman over it Such\na demonstration ought to remove the surprize with which the\nprodigious effect of the helm is sometimes considered, from an\ninattention to its mechanism: for we need only to observe the pressure\nof the water, which acts at a great distance from the centre of gravity\nG, about which the ship is supposed to turn, and we shall easily\nperceive the difference there is between the effort of the water against\nthe helmsman, and the effect of the same impulse against the vessel With regard to the person who steers, the water acts only with the\narm of a very short lever N B, of which B is the fulcrum: on the\ncontrary, with regard to the ship, the force of the water is impressed\nin the direction N P, which passes to a great distance from G, and acts\nupon a very long lever E G, which renders the action of the rudder\nextremely powerful in turning the vessel; so that, in a large ship, the\nrudder receives a shock from the water of 2700 or 2800 pounds,\nwhich is frequently the case, when she sails at the rate of three or four\nleagues by the hour; and this force being applied in E, perhaps 100 or\n110 feet distant from the centre of gravity G, will operate upon the\nship, to turn her about, with 270000 or 308000 pounds; whilst, in the\nlatter case, the helmsman acts with an effort which exceeds not 30\npounds upon the spokes of the wheel After what has been said of the helm, it is easy to judge, that the\nmore a ship increases her velocity with regard to the sea, the more\npowerful will be the effect of the rudder, because it acts against the\nwater with a force, which increases as the square of the swiftness of\nthe fluid, whether the ship advances or retreats; or, in other words,\nwhether she has head-way or stern-way; with this distinction, that in\nthese two circumstances the effects will be contrary For if the vessel\nretreats, or moves astern, the helm will be impressed from I to N, fig 1 plate V and, instead of being pushed, according to N P, it will\n\n\nreceive the effort of the water from N towards R; so that the stern wall\nbe transported according to the same movement, and the head turned\nin a contrary direction When the helm operates by itself, the centre of rotation of the ship,\nand her movement, are determined by estimating the force of this\nmachine; that is to say, by multiplying the surface of the rudder by\nthe square of the ship’s velocity[34] See the articles Rudder, Sailing,\nSteering, Trim, and Working HIGH AND DRY, a phrase which implies the situation of a ship,\nwhen she has run aground, so as to be seen dry upon the strand HIGH WATER, haute marée, the greatest height of the flood-tide, See\nFlood and Tide",

because a great number of turns of a large rope would soon\ncover the whole barrel, and utterly destroy the effect of this motion,\ntill those turns could be removed; a circumstance which might be\nattended with very bad consequences On the contrary, when there\nare only a few turns, the capstern or windlass is always kept\nsufficiently clear for action for it is evident, that every revolution of\neither will heave-in a quantity of the rope, upon which it is employed,\nequal to the circumference of its barrel Now as there are only a few\nturns upon the barrel at once, an equal quantity of the rope will\nnecessarily come off from the capstern at the same time; and this is\naccordingly pulled back as strongly as possible, to prevent it from\nsurging or jerking round the barrel, by being held too loosely This is\ncalled holding-on, which therefore may be defined, the act of retaining\nany quantity of rope, acquired by the effort of a capstern, windlass, or\ntackle, as being employed in hoisting as well as heaving Holding water, the operation of stopping a boat in her course, by\nholding the oars in the water and bearing the blade, or flat part,\nstrongly against the current made along-side, by her passing swiftly\nthrough the water See Back-astern, Oar, and Rowing HOLLOA commande an exclamation of answer, to any person, who\ncalls to another to ask some question, or to give a particular order Thus, if the master intends to give any order to the people in the\nmain-top, he previously calls, Main-top, hoay To which they answer,\nHolloa to shew that they hear him, and are ready It is also the first\nanswer in hailing a ship at a distance See Hailing HOME, in a naval sense, either implies the situation of some object,\nwhere it retains its full force of action;

and indeed the security, or\n\n\nfirmness of the stowage, greatly depends on this circumstance Home, when spoken of the anchor, seems to imply the station of\nthe ship, with regard to her anchor; which is accordingly said to come\nhome when it loosens from the ground, by the effort of the cable, and\napproaches the place where the ship floated, at the length of her\nmoorings See the article Anchor HOMMOC, tertre, a name given by mariners to a hillock, or small\neminence of land resembling the figure of a cone, and appearing on\nthe sea-coast of any country HOOD, tremue, a sort of low wooden porch, resembling the\ncompanion, and placed over the stair-case or ladder, which leads into\nthe steerage or apartments, where the crew generally reside in a\nmerchant-ship The use of the hood is to admit the air and light, and\nat the same time prevent the rain from falling into the steerage HOOK, a crooked piece of iron, of which there are several of\ndifferent shapes and sizes, used at sea, as boat-hooks, can-hooks, cat-\nhooks, fish-hooks, foot-hooks, &c See the articles Boat-hook, Can-\nhook, &c HORSE, marche-pied, a rope reaching from the middle of a yard to\nits extremity, or what is called the yard-arm, and depending about\ntwo or three feet under the yard for the sailors to tread upon, whilst\nthey are loosing, reefing or furling the sails, rigging out the studding-\nsail booms, &c In order therefore to keep the horse more parallel to\nthe yard, it is usually suspended thereto, at proper distances, by\ncertain ropes called stirrups, which hang about two feet under the\nyard, having an eye in their lower ends through which the horse\npasses See the article Rigging Horse is also a thick rope, extended in a perpendicular direction\nnear the fore or after-side of a mast, for the purpose of hoisting or\nextending some sail thereon When it is fixed before a mast, it is\ncalculated for the use of a sail called the square-sail, whose yard being\nattached to the horse, by means of a traveller, or bull’s-eye, which\nslides up and down occasionally, is retained in a steddy position,\neither when the sail is set, or whilst it is hoisting or lowering When\nthe horse is placed abaft or behind a mast, it is intended for the try-sail\nof a snow, and is accordingly very rarely fixed in this position, except\nin those sloops of war which occasionally assume the form of snows,\nin order to deceive the enemy HOUNDS, a name given to those parts of a mast-head, which\ngradually project on the right and left side, beyond the cylindrical or\n\n\nconical surface, which it preserves from the partners upwards The\nhounds, whose upper parts are also called cheeks, are used as\nshoulders to support the frame of the top, together with the top-mast\nand the rigging of the lower-mast See the article Mast HOUSED, à la serre, the situation of the great guns of a ship, when\nthey are secured at sea by their tackles and breechings See Cannon HOWKER, a vessel in the Dutch marine, commonly navigated with\ntwo masts, viz a main-mast and a mizen-mast, and being from sixty to\nupwards of two hundred tons in burthen HOUSING, or HOUSE-LINE, a small line, formed of three fine\nstrands, or twists of hemp, smaller than rope-yarn It is chiefly used to\nseize blocks into their strops, to bind the corners of the sails, or to\nfasten the bottom of a sail to its bolt-rope, &c See Bolt-rope HOY, a small vessel, chiefly used in coasting, or carrying goods to\nor from a ship, in a road or bay, where the ordinary lighters cannot be\nmanaged with safety or convenience It would be very difficult to describe, precisely, the marks of\ndistinction between this vessel and some others of the same size,\nwhich are also rigged in the same manner; because what is called a\nhoy in one place, would assume the name of a sloop or smack in\nanother: and even the people, who navigate these vessels, have, upon\nexamination, very vague ideas of the marks by which they are\ndistinguished from those above mentioned In Holland, the hoy has\ntwo masts; in England it has but one, where the main-sail is\nsometimes extended by a boom, and sometimes without it Upon the\nwhole, it may be defined a small vessel, usually rigged as a sloop, and\nemployed for carrying passengers and luggage from one place to\nanother, particularly on the sea-coast HULK, an old ship of war, fitted with an apparatus, to fix or take\nout the masts of his majesty’s ships, as occasion requires The mast of this vessel, a a, fig 2 plate V is extremely high, and\nwithal properly strengthened by shrouds and stays, in order to secure\nthe sheers, machine à mater, which serve, as the arm of a crane, to\nhoist out or in the masts of any ship lying alongside The sheers, b b,\nare composed of several long masts, whose heels rest upon the side of\nthe hulk, and having their heads declining outward from the\nperpendicular, so as to hang over the vessel whose masts are to be\nfixed or displaced The tackles, c c, which extend from the head of the\nmast to the sheer-heads, are intended to pull in the latter towards the\nmast-head, particularly when they are charged with the weight of a\n\n\nmast after it is raised out of any ship, which is performed by strong\ntackles depending from the sheer-heads The effort of these tackles is\nproduced by two capsterns, fixed on the deck for this purpose Hulk is also a name bestowed on any old vessel laid by, as unfit for\nfurther service: it is probably derived from the ολκαδες, or vessels of\nburthen of the ancient Grecians HULL, corps d’un vaisseau, the frame, or body of a ship, exclusive of\nher masts, yards, sails, and rigging: it is usually expressed of a ship\neither before she is furnished with masts, &c or after she is dismasted\nand stripped of the aforesaid machinery To Hull a ship, is to fire cannon-balls into her hull within the point-\nblank range Hull-to, the situation of a ship when she is trying a-hull, or with all\nher sails furled;

but in merchant ships this union is bordered with a\nred field See the article Union JAMMING, the act of inclosing any object between two bodies, so\nas to render it immoveable, whilst they continue in the same position This expression is usually applied to the situation of some running-\nrope, when it happens to be squeezed by the compression of the\nstanding-rigging, &c and by consequence incapable of performing its\noffice, by traversing in the blocks, till it is released from this\nconfinement In this sense jamming is opposed to rendering, which see A cask, box, &c is also said to be jammed, when it is in the same\nmanner wedged in between weighty bodies, so as not to be dislodged\nwithout great difficulty JEARS, or GEERS, drisse, an assemblage of tackles, by which the\nlower yards of a ship are hoisted up along the mast to their usual\nstation, or lowered from thence as occasion requires; the former of\nwhich operations is called swaying, and the latter, striking See those\narticles In a ship of war, the jears are usually composed of two strong\ntackles, each of which has two blocks, viz one fastened to the lower-\nmast-head, and the other to the middle of the yard The two blocks\nwhich are lashed to the middle, or slings of the yard, are retained in\nthis situation by means of two cleats, nailed on each side, whose arms\nenclose the ropes by which the blocks are fastened to the yard The\ntwo ropes, which communicate with these tackles, lead down to the\ndeck on the opposite side of the mast, according to the situation of the\nupper jear-blocks The jears, in merchant-ships, have usually two large single blocks\non the opposite side of the mast-head, and another of the same size in\nthe middle of the yard The rope, which communicates with these,\npasses through one of the blocks hanging at the mast-head, then\nthrough the block on the yard, and afterwards through the other\nhanging-block upon the mast To the two lower ends of this rope, on\nthe opposite sides of the mast, are fixed two tackles, each of which is\nformed of two double blocks, the lower one being hooked to a ring-\n\n\nbolt in the deck, and the upper one spliced, or seized into the lower\nend of the great rope above, which is called the tye By this\ncontrivance the mechanical power of the tackle below is transmitted\nto the tye, which, communicating with blocks on the yard, readily\nsways up, or lowers it, either by the effort of both jears at once, on the\nopposite sides of the mast, or by each of them separately, one after\nthe other JETTY-HEAD, a name usually given, in the royal dock-yards, to that\npart of a wharf which projects beyond the rest; but more particularly\nthe front of a wharf, whose side forms one of the cheeks of a dry or\nwet dock JEWEL-BLOCKS, a name given to two small blocks, which are\nsuspended at the extremity of the main and fore-top-sail-yards, by\nmeans of an eye-bolt, driven from without into the middle of the yard-\narm, parallel to its axis The use of these blocks is to retain the upper-\npart of the topmast studding-sails beyond the skirts of the top-sails, so\nthat each of those sails may have its full force of action, which would\nbe diminished by the incroachment of the other over its surface The\nhaliards, by which those studding-sails are hoisted, are accordingly\npassed through the jewel-blocks; whence, communicating with a block\non the top-mast-head, they lead downwards to the top or decks, where\nthey may be conveniently hoisted See the article Sail JIB, foc, the foremost sail of a ship, being a large stay-sail extended\nfrom the outer end of the bowsprit, prolonged by the jib-boom,\ntowards the fore-top-mast-head See Sail The jib is a sail of great command with any side-wind, but\nespecially when the ship is close-hauled, or has the wind upon her\nbeam; and its effort in casting the ship, or turning her head to leeward,\nis very powerful, and of great utility, particularly when the ship is\nworking through a narrow channel See Sailing Jib-Boom, a boom run out from the extremity of the bowsprit,\nparallel to its length, and serving to extend the bottom of the jib, and\nthe stay of the fore-top-gallant-mast This boom, which is nothing\nmore than a continuation of the bowsprit forward, to which it may be\nconsidered as a top-mast, is usually attached to the bowsprit by means\nof two large boom-irons, (see the article Iron-Work) or by one\nboom-iron, and a cap on the outer-end of the bowsprit; or, finally, by\nthe cap without, and a strong lashing within, instead of a boom-iron;\nwhich is generally the method of securing it in small merchant-ships It may therefore be drawn in upon the bowsprit, as occasion requires,\n\n\nwhich is usually practised when the ship enters a harbour, where it\nmight very soon be broke, or carried away, by the vessels which are\nmoored therein, or passing by under sail JIBING See Gybing JIGGER, a machine, consisting of a piece of rope about five feet\nlong, with a block at one end and a sheave at the other; and used to\nhold-on the cable, when it is heaved into the ship by the revolution of\nthe windlass See Holding-on The jigger is particularly useful when the cable is either slippery\nwith mud or ooze, or when it is stiff and unwieldy; in both of which\ncases it is very difficult to stretch it back from the windlass by hand,\nwhich however is done with facility and expedition, by means of the\njigger, as follows: the end of the rope, to which the sheave is fastened\nby a knot, is passed round the cable close to the windlass, and the\nhind part of the rope coming over the sheave, is stretched aft by\nmeans of another rope passing through the jigger-block As soon as\nthe last rope is extended, the turn of the former about the cable is\nfirmly retained in its position, by the compression of its hind part\nunder the sheave, acting upon what may be called the neck of the\njigger But as the cable continues to be heaved into the ship, it is\nevident that the jigger, which is fastened on a particular part thereof,\nstretching it back, will be removed further aft, by every turn of the\nwindlass, and the effort of the jigger will be lessened in proportion to\nits distance from the windlass: this circumstance renders it necessary\nto fleet it, or replace in a proper state of action, as occasion requires The man who performs this office accordingly calls out, fleet, jigger one of the men, at the windlass, instantly fixes his handspec between\nthe deck and the cable, so as to jam the latter to the windlass, and\nprevent it from running out till the jigger is refixed Jigger-Tackle, a light small tackle, consisting of a double and\nsingle block, and used on sundry occasions by seamen See Tackle IN, dedans, the state of any of a ship’s sails, when they are furled or\nstowed It is used in this sense also in opposition to out, which implies\nthat they are set, or extended to assist the ship’s course INSURANCE, assurance, a certain contract, by which an individual,\nor company, agrees to indemnify whatever losses or damages may\nhappen to a ship or cargo, during a voyage, provided they are not\noccasioned by default of the person insured For this agreement the\nlatter pays a certain sum in advance, called the præmium, which\naccordingly falls to the insurer, in case the ship arrives in a safe\n\n\nharbour; but if the ship is lost, the insurer renders the stipulated sum\nto the merchant JOURNAL, in navigation, a sort of diary, or daily register of the\nship’s course, winds, and weather; together with a general account of\nwhatever is material to be remarked in the period of a sea-voyage In all sea-journals, the day, or what is called the 24 hours,\nterminates at noon, because the errors of the dead-reckoning are at\nthat period generally corrected by a solar observation The daily\ncompact usually contains the state of the weather; the variation,\nincrease, or diminution of the wind; and the suitable shifting,\nreducing, or enlarging the quantity of sail extended; as also the most\nmaterial incidents of the voyage, and the condition of the ship and her\ncrew; together with the discovery of other ships or fleets, land, shoals,\nbreakers, soundings, &c The form of keeping journals is very different in merchant-ships;\nbut one method appears to be invariably pursued in the navy, which\nnevertheless is certainly capable of improvement, because no form\ncan be properly called perfect, that leaves as great a space for one\nday’s work, the matter of which may be contained in very few lines,\nas for another that abounds with important incidents, so as to occupy\nten times the space If therefore there be any such thing as propriety\nof method on this occasion, it seems to imply, that the space\ncontaining, should conform to the matter contained, which will\nnecessarily be greater or less, according to circumstances IRON-WORK, ferrure, a general name for all the pieces of iron, of\nwhatsoever figure or size, which are used in the construction of a\nship: as bolts, boom-irons, nails, spikes, chains and chain-plates,\nblock-strops, cranks, braces, pintles, and googings The most material of these articles are explained in their proper\nplaces; but as the article bolt, of which the figures are represented in\nplate II was accidentally omitted in the proper place, according to the\nplan of this work, it may not be improperly introduced here A bolt then is generally a cylindrical pin of iron, of which there are\nvarious sorts, used for sundry occasions in ship-building The bolts are principally employed either to unite several members\nof a ship’s frame into one solid piece, or to fasten any moveable body\non a particular occasion Those which are calculated for the former\npurpose have commonly small round heads, somewhat flatted, as in\nfig 1 & 2 plate II On the contrary, the bolts which are intended for\nthe latter use, have either a large round head, as those of the chains,\n\n\nfig",

as the keel forms and unites\nthe bottom by timbers The keel is generally composed of several thick pieces, (A, plate I Pieces of the Hull) placed lengthways, which, after being scarfed\ntogether, are bolted, and clinched upon the upper side When these\npieces cannot be procured large enough to afford a sufficient depth to\nthe keel, there is a strong thick piece of timber bolted to the bottom\nthereof, called the false keel, which is also very useful in preserving\nthe lower-side of the main keel In our largest ships of war, the false\nkeel is generally composed of two pieces, which are called the upper\nand the lower false keels See Midship-Frame The lowest plank in a ship’s bottom, called the garboard-streak, has\nits inner-edge let into a groove, or channel, cut longitudinally on the\nside of the keel: the depth of this channel is therefore regulated by the\n\n\nthickness of the garboard-streak Keel is also a name given to a low flat-bottomed vessel, used in the\nriver Tyne to bring the coals down from Newcastle, and the adjacent\nparts, in order to load the colliers for transportation Upon an even Keel, the position of a ship when her keel is parallel\nto the plane of the horizon, so that she is equally deep in the water at\nboth ends Keel-hauling, a punishment inflicted for various offences in the\nDutch navy It is performed by plunging the delinquent repeatedly\nunder the ship’s bottom on one side, and hoisting him up on the\nother, after having passed under the keel The blocks, or pullies, by\nwhich he is suspended, are fastened to the opposite extremities of the\nmain-yard, and a weight of lead or iron is hung upon his legs to sink\nhim to a competent depth By this apparatus he is drawn close up to\nthe yard-arm, and thence let fall suddenly into the sea, where, passing\nunder the ship’s bottom, he is hoisted up on the opposite side of the\nvessel As this extraordinary sentence is executed with a serenity of\ntemper peculiar to the Dutch, the culprit is allowed sufficient intervals\nto recover the sense of pain, of which indeed he is frequently deprived\nduring the operation In truth, a temporary insensibility to his\nsufferings ought by no means to be construed into a disrespect of his\njudges, when we consider that this punishment is supposed to have\npeculiar propriety in the depth of winter, whilst the flakes of ice are\nfloating on the stream; and that it is continued till the culprit is almost\nsuffocated for want of air, benumbed with the cold of the water, or\nstunned with the blows his head receives by striking the ship’s\nbottom To KEEP, a term used on several occasions in navigation: as,\nTo Keep the land aboard, is to keep within sight of land as much as\npossible See also Hold To Keep the luff, to continue close to the wind, i e sailing with a\ncourse inclined to the direction of the wind, as much as possible,\nwithout deviating to leeward This is also called, keeping the wind See\nClose-hauled To Keep off, alargeer, tenir le largue, to sail off, or keep at a distance\nfrom the shore See also Offing Boat-Keeper, one of the rowers, who remains as a centinel in his\nturn, to take care of any boat and her contents, either when she lies\nby the shore, or along-side of the ship;

as this\npiece is always called the cut-water by seamen, if we except a few,\nwho affecting to be wiser than their brethren, have adopted this\nexpression probably on the presumption that the other is a cant\nphrase, or vulgarism It appears a material part of the province of this\nwork to call the several articles contained therein by their proper\nnames, and to reject those which are spurious, however sanctified by\nthe authority of official dulness, or seconded by the adoption of\ndignified ignorance Accordingly we cannot help observing, that when\na term of art has been established from time immemorial, and besides\nbeing highly expressive, produces the testimony of foreign nations[36]\nto its propriety, nothing more certainly betrays a superficial\nunderstanding, than the attempt to change it, without being able to\nassign the shadow of a reason for this alteration For although knee of\nthe head, being invariably used by the artificers, is of course explained\nin this work as a term of naval architecture, wherein practice has\nindeed rendered it natural and intelligible; it is nevertheless very\nrarely used by seamen, especially in common discourse, unless when\nit is intended to impress the hearer with an idea of the speaker’s\nsuperior judgment KNIGHT-HEAD, or Bollard-Timber See the article Head Knight-Heads, two strong pieces of timber, fixed on the opposite\nsides of the main-deck, a little behind the fore-mast, in a merchant-\nship They are used to support and inclose the ends of the windlass,\nwhich accordingly is turned therein as upon an axis As each of the\nknight-heads is formed of two pieces, they may be occasionally\nseparated in order to take off the turns of the cable from the windlass,\nor replace them upon it They are sometimes called the bits, and in\nthis sense their upper-parts only are denominated knight-heads, which\n\n\nbeing formerly embellished with a figure designed to resemble a\nhuman head, gave rise to the name they have ever since retained See\nthe article Windlass Knight-heads, sep de drisse, was also a name formerly given to the\nlower jear-blocks, which were then no other than bits, containing\nseveral sheaves, and nearly resembling our present top-sail-sheet bits KNITTLE, eguillette, (from knit) a small line, which is either plaited\nor twisted, and used for various purposes at sea; as to fasten the\nservice on the cable, to reef the sails by the bottom, and to hang the\nhammocs between decks, &c KNOT, a large knob formed on the extremity of a rope, by\nuntwisting the ends thereof, and interweaving them regularly amongst\neach other There are several sorts of knots, which differ in their form\nand size, according to the uses for which they are designed: the\nprincipal of these are the diamond-knot, the rose-knot, the wall-knot\nor walnut, some of which are single, and others double The knots are generally used to fasten one rope to another, by\nmeans of a small cord attached to the neck of the knot, called the\nlaniard, which is firmly tied about both ropes They are also designed\nto prevent the end of a rope from sliding through an eye, which the\nknot is intended to confine in a particular situation See Beckets L TO LABOUR, travailler, as a sea-term, implies to roll or pitch heavily\nin a turbulent sea; an effect, by which the masts and hull of the ship\nare greatly endangered, because by the rolling motion the masts strain\nupon their shrouds with an effort, which increases as the sine of their\nobliquity: and the continual agitation of the vessel gradually loosens\nher joints, and often makes her extremely leaky LADDER, echelle, a well-known convenience, of which there are a\ngreat number in a ship, formed of two pieces of plank joined together\nby crosspieces, which serve as steps, whereby to mount or descend\nfrom one deck to another The ladders derive their names from the several hatchways, or other\nparts of a ship, wherein they are situated Besides these, there are, of\na particular construction, the accommodation-ladder and the quarter-\nladders Accommodation-Ladder, is a sort of light stair-case, occasionally\nfixed on the gangway of the admiral, or commander in chief, of a\nfleet It is furnished with rails and entering-ropes, covered with red\nbays, and the lower-end of it is retained at a competent distance from\nthe ship’s side by iron bars, or braces, to render the passage more\nconvenient to those who enter or depart from the ship See the article\nGangway Quarter-Ladders, two ladders of rope, depending from the right\nand left side of a ship’s stern, whereby to descend into the boats\nwhich are moored astern, in order to bring them up along-side of the\nship; or to use them for any other occasion LADEN, chargée, the state of a ship when she is charged with a\nweight or quantity of any sort of merchandizes, or other materials,\nequal to her tonnage or burthen If the cargo with which she is laden\nis extremely heavy, her burthen is determined by the weight of the\ngoods; and if it is light, she carries as much as she can stow, to be fit\nfor the purposes of navigation As a ton in measure is generally\nestimated at 2000 lb in weight, a vessel of 200 tons ought\naccordingly to carry a weight equal to 400,000 lb when the matter of\nwhich the cargo is composed is specifically heavier than the water in\nwhich she floats; or, in other words, when the cargo is so heavy that\nshe cannot float high enough, with so great a quantity of it, as her\nhold will contain Laden in bulk, the state of being freighted with a cargo which is\nneither in casks, boxes, bales, or cases, but lies loose in the hold;\nbeing defended from the moisture, or wet of the hold, by a number of\nmats and a quantity of dunnage Such are usually the cargoes of corn,\nsalt, or such materials LAID-UP, the situation of a ship when she is either moored in a\nharbour during the winter season, or laid by, for want of employment:\nor when by age and craziness she is rendered incapable of further\nservice LANCH, a peculiar sort of long-boat, used by the French, Spanish,\nand Italian shipping; and in general by those of other European\nnations, when employed in voyaging in the Mediterranean sea A lanch is proportionably longer, lower, and more flat-bottomed\nthan the long-boat; it is by consequence less fit for sailing, but better\ncalculated for rowing and approaching a flat shore Its principal\nsuperiority to the long-boat, however, consists in being, by its\nconstruction, much fitter to under-run the cable, which is a very\nnecessary employment in the harbours of the Levant sea, where the\ncables of different ships are fastened across each other, and frequently\nrender this exercise extremely necessary Lanch is also the movement by which a ship or boat descends from\nthe shore, either when she is at first built, or at any time afterwards To facilitate the operation of lanching, and prevent any interruption\ntherein, the ship is supported by two strong platforms, laid with a\ngradual inclination to the water, on the opposite sides of her keel, to\nwhich they are parallel Upon the surface of this declivity are placed\ntwo corresponding ranges of planks, which compose the base of a\nframe called the cradle, whose upper-part envelops the ship’s bottom,\nwhereto it is securely attached Thus the lower surface of the cradle,\nconforming exactly to that of the frame below, lies flat upon it,\nlengthways, under the opposite sides of the ship’s bottom; and as the\nformer is intended to slide downwards upon the latter, carrying the\nship along with it, the planes or faces of both are well daubed with\nsoap and tallow The necessary preparations for the lanch being made, all the blocks\nand wedges, by which the ship was formerly supported, are driven out\nfrom under her keel, till her whole weight gradually subsides upon\nthe platforms above described, which are accordingly called the ways The shores and stanchions by which she is retained upon the stocks till\nthe period approaches for lanching, are at length cut away, and the\n\n\nscrews applied to move her, if necessary The motion usually begins\non the instant when the shores are cut, and the ship slides downward\nalong the ways, which are generally prolonged under the surface of\nthe water, to a sufficient depth, to float her as soon as she arrives at\nthe farthest end thereof When a ship is to be lanched, the ensign, jack, and pendant, are\nalways hoisted, the last being displayed from a staff erected in the\nmiddle of the ship Plate V fig 4 represents a ship of war ready to be\nlanched from the stocks The largest ship that ever was lanched in England, is the Britannia,\nof 100 guns, built at Portsmouth Ships of the first rate are commonly\nconstructed in dry docks, and afterwards floated out, by throwing\nopen the flood-gates, and suffering the tide to enter, as soon as they\nare finished LAND-FALL, atterrage, the first land discovered after a sea-voyage:\nhence it is common for ships, who accost each other at sea, to wish a\ngood land-fall at parting, by which they imply a discovery of land, at\nor near the place whither their course is directed, and which they\nexpect to make by their journals Land-locked, bouclé, the situation of a ship which is environed by\nthe land on all sides in a road, bay, or haven; so as to exclude the\nprospect of the sea, unless over some intervening land See the French\nword terre, and the phrases following it LANGREL, or LANGRAGE, mitrailles, a particular kind of shot,\nformed of bolts, nails, bars, or other pieces of iron tied together, and\nforming a sort of cylinder, which corresponds with the bore of the\ncannon, from which it is intended to be discharged This contrivance\nis particularly designed to wound or carry away the masts, or tear the\nsails and rigging of the adversary, so as to disable him from flight or\npursuit It is never used in royal ships, but very often by privateers\nand merchantmen LANIARD, (lanier, Fr ) a short piece of cord or line, fastened to\nseveral machines in a ship, and serving to secure them in a particular\nplace, or to manage them more conveniently Such are the laniards of\nthe gun-ports, the laniard of the buoy, the laniard of the cat-hook, &c The principal laniards used in a ship, however, are those employed\nto extend the shrouds and stays of the masts, by their communication\nwith the dead-eyes, so as to form a sort of mechanical power,\nresembling that of a tackle See Dead-Eyes These laniards, rides, are fixed in the dead-eyes as follows: One end\n\n\nof the laniard is thrust through one of the holes in the upper dead-eye,\nand then knotted, to prevent it from drawing out; the other end is\nthen passed through one of the holes in the lower dead-eye, whence,\nreturning upward, it is inserted through the second hole in the upper\ndead-eye, and next through the second in the lower dead-eye, and\nfinally through the third holes in both dead-eyes The end of the\nlaniard being then directed upwards from the lowest dead-eye, is\nstretched as stiff as possible by the application of tackles; and that the\nseveral parts of it may slide with more facility through the holes in\nthe dead-eyes, it is well smeared with hog’s lard or tallow, so that the\nstrain is immediately communicated to all the turns at once LANTHORN, a well-known machine, of which there are many used\nin a ship, particularly for the purpose of directing the course of other\nships in a fleet or convoy: such are the poop and top-lanthorns, &c LAP-SIDED, bordier, the state of a ship, which is built in such a\nmanner as to have one side heavier than the other; and, by\nconsequence, to retain a constant heel, or inclination towards the\nheaviest side; unless when she is brought upright, by placing a greater\nquantity of the cargo, or ballast, on the other side See Ballast LARBOARD, babord, a name given by seamen to the left side of a\nship, wherein the right and left are apparently determined by the\nanalogy of a ship’s position, on the water, to that of a fish LARGE, a phrase applied to the wind, when it crosses the line of a\nship’s course in a favourable direction, particularly on the beam or\nquarter To understand this more clearly, let us suppose a ship steering\nwest; then the wind, in any point of the compass to the eastward of\nthe south or north, may be called large, unless indeed when it is\ndirectly east, and then it is said to be right aft Sailing Large, aller vent largue, is therefore advancing with a large\nwind, so as that the sheets are slackened and flowing, and the bowlines\nentirely disused This phrase is generally opposed to sailing close-\nhauled, or with a scant wind, in which situation the sheets and\nbowlines are extended as much as possible LASHING, amarrage, a piece of rope employed to fasten or secure\nany moveable body in a ship, or about her masts, sails, and rigging:\nalso the act of fastening or securing any thing by means of the rope\nused for this purpose LATEEN-SAIL, a long triangular sail extended by a lateen-yard, and\nfrequently used by xebecs, polacres, settees, and other vessels\nnavigated in the Mediterranean sea LAYING the Land, in navigation, the state of motion which\nincreases the distance from the coast, so as to make it appear lower\nand smaller; a circumstance which evidently arises from the\nintervening convexity of the surface of the sea It is used in\ncontradistinction to raising the land, which is produced by the\nopposite motion of approach towards it LEAK, a chink or breach in the decks, sides, or bottom of a ship,\nthrough which the water passes into her hull When a leak first\ncommences, the vessel is said to have sprung a leak LEAKY, the state of a ship when abounding with leaks LEE, an epithet used by seamen to distinguish that part of the\nhemisphere to which the wind is directed, from the other part whence\nit arises; which latter is accordingly called to windward This\nexpression is chiefly used when the wind crosses the line of a ship’s\ncourse, so that all on one side of her is called to-windward, and all on\nthe opposite side, to leeward: and hence,\nUnder the Lee, implies farther to the leeward, or farther from that\npart of the horizon from whence the wind blows; as,\nUnder the Lee of the shore; i e at a short distance from the shore\nwhich lies to windward This phrase is commonly understood to\nexpress the situation of a vessel, anchored, or sailing under the\nweather-shore, where there is always smoother water, and less danger\nof heavy seas, than at a great distance from it[37] Lee-larches, the sudden and violent rolls which a ship often takes\nto the leeward in a high sea, particularly when a large wave strikes\nher on the weather-side Lee-side, all that part of a ship or boat which lies between the\nmast, and the side farthest from the direction of the wind; or\notherwise, the half of a ship, which is pressed down towards the water\nby the effort of the sails, as separated from the other half, by a line\ndrawn through the middle of her length That part of the ship, which\nlies to windward of this line, is accordingly called the weather-side Thus admit a ship to be sailing southward, with the wind at east,\nthen is her starboard, or right-side, the lee-side; and the larboard, or\nleft, the weather-side Leeward-ship, a vessel that falls much to-leeward of her course,\nwhen sailing close-hauled, and consequently loses much ground To Leeward, towards that part of the horizon which lies under the\nlee, or whither the wind bloweth Thus, “We saw a fleet under the\nlee,” and, “We saw a fleet to-leeward,” are synonimous expressions Lee-way, is the lateral movement of a ship to-leeward of her\ncourse, or the angle which the line of her way makes with the keel\nwhen she is close-hauled",
    "Lee-way, is the lateral movement of a ship to-leeward of her\ncourse, or the angle which the line of her way makes with the keel\nwhen she is close-hauled See that article This movement is produced by the mutual effort of the wind and\nsea upon her side, forcing her to-leeward of the line upon which she\nappears to sail; and in this situation her course is necessarily a\ncompound of the two motions by which she is impelled, of which the\none presses forward, according to the line of her keel, from H to K,\nfig 5 plate V whilst the other, acting in the line B A, pushes her to\nleeward of the course from B towards A, with a motion which is\nusually in proportion to the force of the wind, and the rate of her\nvelocity, as appears by the following theory When a ship is close-hauled, and the head-sails are in perfect\nequilibrio with those abaft, the resistance of the water from A to B fig 5 plate V is equal to the impulse of the sails, whether it is\nimpressed upon the centre of gravity H of the ship, or any other point\nof her length before or abaft it In this situation, the ship will as\nreadily bear away as come nearer to the wind, with regard to the\nresistance of the water upon her bottom on one side, and the\nimpulsion of the wind upon the sails on the other But it must be\nobserved, that the united effort of the sails acts upon the ship\naccording to a direction B A, perpendicular to their surfaces, and\ncommencing its action in some point H, being the mean d between the\ndifferent effects C G, of the sails afore and abaft, which should exactly\ncorrespond with the resistance of the water from A towards B; so that\nthe vessel is pushed to leeward of the course I K, which she steers in\nthe direction B A of the effort of the sails But the resistance of the\nwater, acting upon the lee-side of her bottom, counterbalances this\neffort, and becomes stronger, in proportion to the greater facility with\nwhich she divides the fluid with her stem; so that she will really\nadvance in the course N R, which lies nearer the line of her keel than\nB A Thus the angle K H R of the lee-way is proportional to the greater\nor less resistance the ship meets with from the fluid upon her lee side,\nrespectively with her greater or less facility of dividing it with her\nfore-part; so that the lee-way is very inconsiderable, except, when the\nship is close-hauled, and is accordingly disregarded whenever the\nwind, is large This demonstration might be pushed farther by a fact founded on\ndaily experience, which proves that not only the lee-way depends on\nthe form of the vessel, but also the degree of velocity with which she\n\n\nadvances; and perhaps never, intirely, upon the greater or less\nobliquity of the sails with the keel, as some authors have pretended For when a swift-sailing ship is close-hauled, with all her sails out, in a\nvery light wind, and scarcely having steerage-way, the lee-way is\nconsiderable even in smooth water This is occasioned by the tardy\nmotion of the vessel, which being feebly pushed forward, cannot\nimpress the water with a forcible effect, and by consequence feels no\nresistance from it, but is accordingly carried with facility by her sails,\nin the direction of their effort B A: and if we consider the situation of\nthe ship’s side, which presents a great surface of sail above the water,\nit appears that the lee-way will become yet more perpendicular to the\nkeel But when the wind makes a forcible impression, the velocity of\nmoving forward is considerably augmented; the ship strikes the fluid\nwith a force, expressed by the square of two or three leagues of\nswiftness, from B towards A, in the space of an hour, whilst the water\nrepels her effort in a contrary direction The resistance of the water is\nthen, in the ratio of this square, to the square of her first velocity, or\nhead-way; and in this state will not readily yield to its effort The lee-\nway immediately decreases, and will be still farther diminished, if the\nship’s course is accelerated If then at the moment when the ship\nadvances with great rapidity, she bears away 12 or 15 degrees, or even\ntwo points, without altering the general arrangement of her sails,\ntheir obliquity remains the same, the ship therefore ought to have the\nsame lee-way, according to the opinion of those who have written on\nthe theory of sailing The velocity is augmented, because the sails then\nreceive the wind by a greater sine of incidence, and thereby acquire a\nmore powerful effort, whilst the ship’s head is always struck by the\nwater in the same parts, and by the same sine of incidence; so that the\nlee-way is also diminished, because the water resists more, in\nconsequence of the accelerated swiftness; and because the resistance\nis more exerted on the ship’s side than on her head, which is less\nopposed to its impulsion Hence we may conclude, that the lee-way of\na ship does not entirely depend on the disposition of her sails; that it\nis different in different vessels, because they are neither formed alike,\nnor are their sails equally trimmed in the same oblique courses: and\nfinally, because they have always a different velocity, at the same\ntime, and under the same sail Thus it is evident, that the lee-way is\nalways composed of the ship’s comparative velocity; of her form,\nwhich gives more or less proportional resistance upon the side than on\nthe fore-part; and of the disposition of her sails, as forming a greater\n\n\nor smaller obliquity with the keel See also Close-hauled, Drift,\nand Sailing LEECHES, bords, the borders or edges of a sail, which are either\nsloping or perpendicular See Goring The leeches of all sails, whose tops and bottoms are parallel to the\ndeck, or at right angles with the mast, are denominated from the\nship’s side, and the sail to which they belong; as the starboard leech of\nthe main-sail, the lee leech of the fore-top-sail, &c but the sails which\nare fixed obliquely upon the masts, have their leeches named from\ntheir situation with respect to the ship’s length; as the fore-leech of\nthe mizen, the after-leech of the jib, or fore-stay-sail, &c Leech-Lines, cargues-bouline, certain ropes fastened to the middle\nof the leeches of the main-sail and fore-sail, and communicating with\nblocks under the opposite sides of the top, whence they pass\ndownwards to the deck, serving to truss up those sails to the yard, as\noccasion requires See Brails Leech-rope, ralingue, a name given to that part of the bolt-rope, to\nwhich the border, or skirt of a sail is sewed In all sails, whose\nopposite leeches are of the same length, it is terminated above by the\nearing, and below by the clue See Bolt-rope, Clue, and Earing LENGTHENING, the operation of cutting a ship down across the\nmiddle, and adding a certain portion to her length It is performed by\nsawing her planks asunder, in different places of her length, on each\nside of the midship frame, to prevent her from being weakened too\nmuch in one place The two ends are then drawn apart, to a limited\ndistance, which must be equal to the proposed addition of length An\nintermediate piece of timber is next added to the keel, upon which a\nsufficient number of timbers are erected, to fill up the vacancy\nproduced by the separation The two parts of the kelson are\nafterwards united, by an additional piece which is scored down upon\nthe floor-timbers; and as many beams as may be necessary, are fixed\nacross the ship in the new interval Finally, the planks of the side are\nprolonged, so as to unite with each other, and those of the ceiling\nrefitted in the same manner; by which the whole process is completed To Let in, enclaver, amongst shipwrights, is to fix a diminished part\nof one plank or piece of timber into a vacancy, formed in another for\nthis purpose",

so that they are, according to the sea-phrase, in\nthe wake of each other In the line, or order of battle, all the ships of which it is composed\nare close-hauled, upon the starboard or larboard-tack, about 50\nfathoms distant from each other See plate V fig 5 where a b\nrepresents the elevation, and A B the plan of this order, upon the\nstarboard-tack; the direction of the wind in both being expressed by\nthe arrow in the latter A fleet is more particularly drawn up in the line when in presence\nof an enemy It ought to be formed in such a manner as that the ships\nshould mutually sustain and reinforce each other, and yet preserve a\nsufficient space in their stations, to work or direct their movements\nwith facility during the action Thus they will be enabled effectually\nto cannonade the enemy, without incommoding the ships of their own\nsquadron The line close-hauled is peculiarly chosen as the order of battle,\nbecause if the fleet, which is to windward, were arranged in any other\nline, the enemy might soon gain the weather-gage of it; and even if he\nthinks it expedient to decline that advantage, it will yet be in his\npower to determine the distance between the adverse fleets, in an\nengagement, and to compel the other to action The fleet to leeward,\nbeing in a line close-hauled, parallel to the enemy, can more readily\navail itself of a change of the wind, or of the neglect of its adversary,\nby which it may, by a dextrous management, get to windward of him:\nor, should it fail in this attempt, it will nevertheless be enabled, by the\nfavourable state of the wind, to avoid coming to action, if the enemy\nis greatly superior; or to prevent him from escaping, if he should\n\n\nattempt it Besides these advantages, this order of battle is singularly\nconvenient and proper in other respects The sails of each ship are\ndisposed in such a manner as to counter-act each other, so that the\nships in general neither advance or retreat during the action By this\ncircumstance they are enabled to retain their stations with greater\nstability, and to prosecute the battle with vigour and resolution, yet\nwithout perplexity and disorder The uniformity of the line will be\npreserved, so that the admiral’s orders may be readily communicated\nby signals from the van to the rear The distress of any particular ship,\nthat is disabled and rendered incapable to continue the action, will be\npresently discovered, and her place accordingly supplied by one of the\nships in reserve The circumstances and situation of the enemy’s line\nwill be ever open to the view of the commander in chief, so that he\nmay be enabled to convert any disaster that may happen therein to his\nown advantage It may be alledged indeed, that the same reasons hold good with\nregard to the enemy, to whom this arrangement will be equally\nbeneficial It may also be observed, that particular occasions have\nrendered it necessary to break the order of the line; and that\nsometimes this expedient has been practised with equal judgment and\nsuccess To the first of these allegations it may be answered, that in\nwar as well as politics, there are certain general rules absolutely\nnecessary to be observed by the hostile powers: rules which are\nfounded on mutual convenience, and authorised by the invariable\nexample of all ages Whatever tends to facilitate the designs of the\nadverse parties on each other, or whatever operates to shorten the\nperiod of war, and render it less destructive and fatal, are objects\nwhich ought never to be disregarded Disorder has not only a\ntendency to protract the war, but to make it more bloody and ruinous,\nand to aggravate all the calamities with which it is inseparably\nattended Perhaps this observation is particularly applicable to our\npresent purpose, unless the consequences of disorder in a sea-fight, as\nrelated below, should rather be considered as the creation of fancy,\nthan a recital of facts, naturally resulting from known causes Although peculiar circumstances have sometimes, by their success,\njustified the measure of engaging an enemy’s fleet, without forming\nthe line; or after the line has been separated; there is nevertheless\nvery few operations in war that require greater delicacy and vigilance,\nif the hostile fleets are very near to each other Perhaps no military\n\n\nenterprize can be attended with greater hazard, or with fewer hopes\nof success The incessant fire of so large an assembly of ships in a very\nshort time covers the scene of action with a cloud of smoke, which is\nconstantly accumulating The winds that enabled the two fleets to\napproach each other are soon become extremely feeble, or perhaps\nperfectly lulled, by the explosions of a vigorous cannonade: they are\nof course incapable any longer to dissipate the smoke, which then\ndarkens the air, and is almost impenetrable to the eye If in this\nsituation the hostile ships are promiscuously scattered amongst each\nother, it is easy to foretel the mischief, perplexity, and distraction, to\nwhich the whole will be inevitably exposed Not only is the most\ncomprehensive skill of the commander in chief rendered useless; the\nsmaller ships, abandoned to their ill fortune, may be torn to pieces by\nsuperior force, without relief or succour: and, what is infinitely worse\nthan all, the ships of the same fleet may cannonade each other, with\nall the resolution and spirit which they exert against their enemies If\nthe design of war is conquest, and not massacre, it is thus totally\nperverted The battle, instead of being brought to a speedy issue, and\ndecided by a victory and defeat, is unhappily protracted into a scene\nof slaughter and ruin, equally fatal and undecisive to both parties If then disorder and confusion are fraught with such dangerous\nconsequences in a naval armament, it is no less certain that the\nprincipal sinews of its strength are discipline, regularity, vigilance,\nand activity It has been already remarked, that the ships of the line\nshould be sufficiently close, to sustain each other; for if they are\nfarther apart than those of the enemy’s line, many single ships will\nsuffer the fire of two at once Hence the fleet is rendered inferior to\nthat of the enemy, at the onset of battle; a circumstance which evinces\nthe superiority of larger ships, accompanied with weightier metal the\nenemy is defeated by the efforts of a more numerous and more\npowerful artillery Besides these advantages, the larger ships are in other respects\nhighly preferable in a line of battle They overlook those of an inferior\nrate, which are accordingly laid open to the fire of their musquetry In\na high sea they can more safely employ the artillery of their lower\ndeck than a smaller ship; and if both are obliged to shut their lower\ndeck ports, the advantage of the three-decked ships, with regard to\ntheir cannon, will yet be considerable: they have three tier against\ntwo, and two against one The same superiority subsists, in case they\nare dismasted, when the upper-deck is encumbered with the ruins The large ships, being higher between-decks, are less incommoded\nwith the smoke; and their cannon is managed with greater facility The large ships, having greater solidity of frame, are better\ncalculated to resist the effects of battle and tempest In general also,\nthey sail better than the small ones, except in fine weather; for in a\nfresh wind, when the sea becomes agitated, they have always the\nsuperiority The fire-ships do not succeed so well against large ships as the\nsmaller ones: the artillery will sink them, or oblige them sooner to\nrelinquish their design; and they are easily towed away by the great\nlong boats The line of a fleet, which has abundance of capital ships, need not\nbe so much enclosed as that of an enemy who has fewer The former\nmay be also less numerous, without being weaker An open line will, on many occasions, work more easily than one\nwhich is more enclosed; and if it is less numerous, the movements\nthereof are more expeditious; the signals better attended; the general\norder more exactly preserved; and the ships less liable to be\nseparated Hence it will be less embarrassed by a change of wind, and\nthe order will be sooner re-established A less numerous line will more readily approach or escape from an\nenemy, or a hostile shore; and, finally, when cruizing in a smaller\nspace, it will not be so much contracted From the preceding reflections it results, that the line, which\ncontains more capital ships, will be stronger than one more numerous,\nif composed of smaller ships This reflection however does not exclude\na certain number of the third and fourth rates, which are necessary in\nall naval armaments[38] As the hostile fleets are drawn up in two opposite lines, with their\nsides to the wind, it is evident that one must be to the leeward of the\nother, as appears in fig 8 plate V Both situations however have their\ndefects as well as advantages The advantages of a weather-line are generally, that it may\napproach the enemy so as to determine the time and distance of\naction If it is more numerous than the lee-line, it may easily appoint a\ndetachment to fall upon the van and rear of the latter, and enclose it\nbetween two fires It is little incommoded by the fire or smoke of the\ncannon, and may dispatch the fire-ships, under cover of the smoke,\nupon the disabled ships of the lee-line; or wheresoever they may\noccasion perplexity and disorder, by obliging the enemy to break the\n\n\nline and bear away The weather-line has nevertheless its defects, which sometimes\ncounterbalance the advantages above recited If the sea is rough, and\nthe wind boisterous, it cannot readily fight with the lower-deck\nbattery It cannot decline the action without the dangerous expedient\nof forcing through the enemy’s line: and if it keeps the wind, the lee-\nline may enclose, and totally destroy it, especially if it is inferior in\nnumber to the latter; or if the ships thereof are in bad condition; for it\nthen can find no other resource but in the dexterity of its manœuvres,\nunless it is favoured by the wind, or any oversight of the enemy The\ndisabled ships of the weather-line must tack, to avoid falling into the\nenemy’s fleet; and if they are much shattered, they may be altogether\nseparated from their own fleet, particularly if they are in the rear of\nthe line The line to leeward has also its advantages, which have\noccasionally been preferred to those of the weather-line The ships of\nthe former may use the guns of their lower decks, without the hazard\nof taking in much water at the ports in stormy weather; whereas the\nline to windward dare not open them, without the greatest danger If\nthe lee-line, although more numerous, cannot so easily double upon\nthe van and rear of the enemy, and inclose them between two fires, it\nmay nevertheless have opportunities of tacking, and cutting off a part\nof the enemy’s rear, by obliging them to bear away, or separate from\nthe rest The disabled ships to leeward are much more readily\nremoved from the line than those to windward, without being obliged\nto tack and continue exposed to the enemy’s fire: they bear away, and\nremain at a competent distance from the fleet in a state of safety Finally, the lee-line can with more facility avoid the action than its\nadversary; a circumstance which is extremely favourable to an inferior\nsquadron The defects of the lee-line, on the contrary, are, that it cannot\ndecide the time and distance of the battle, which may commence\nbefore it is sufficiently formed; and it will perhaps be attacked by an\nenemy, who bears away upon it in regular order The fire and smoke\nof the weather-line are a great inconvenience to it; and it cannot\neasily break the enemy’s line with its fire-ships, which are very slowly\nand with great difficulty conveyed to windward It must be remarked, that the admiral’s ship attentively preserves\nher station in the centre of the line; for if the commander in chief\nshould give way to the caprice or inattention of any of those under his\n\n\ndirection, it would introduce an endless disorder into the squadron To illustrate this article, and enable the reader to form a clearer\nidea of the line, we have, in plate V represented several distinct\nviews, according to the different situations which it occasionally\nassumes Fig 7 exhibits a perspective view of the line of battle on the\nstarboard-tack, A B being the plan thereof Fig 8 a, represents the profile of the same line on the starboard-\ntack, as brought to action by the opposite line b The plan of these\nsquadrons, A B, appears immediately below It is necessary to remark here, that a fleet frequently retains the\norder of the same tack, occasionally, when the whole fleet goes about\nat once, as expressed by a, fig 9 of which A is the plan Or it goes\nabout gradually, the headmost ship having tacked first, and the next\ntacked as soon as she arrived in her wake; the rest following the same\nexample See c, fig 7 and C in the plan of the same figure It also frequently preserves the order of the line close-hauled,\nalthough steering with a large wind, either in pursuit of a flying\nenemy, or proceeding in a particular course Thus the fleet b, fig 10",
    "10 although ranged so as to be in a line upon the larboard-tack, if close\nto the wind, is chacing the fleet a to leeward, which is either parallel\nto the former and preserving the same order, or sails on a line abreast,\nas expressed by the plan C See also the article Abreast Fig 11 exhibits a fleet formed into a line, on the starboard-tack,\nbearing away upon the continuation of the same line astern Thus\nsupposing them to be formed on the starboard-tack, and sailing due\nnorth, in a line ahead; it is evident that if every ship, at one and the\nsame time, bears away and steers south, the whole fleet will again be\nupon a line ahead, with the wind upon the larboard-quarter, as\nexpressed in this figure, and in the plan under it Fig 12 represents a fleet bearing away, and having half of its ships\nranged on the starboard-tack, and the other half on the larboard-tack,\nso as to form the two sides of the angle b c a, of which the commander\nin chief a makes the central point This disposition is sometimes used\nto force through a passage which is guarded by an enemy See also the\nplan thereof, A B C below, where it is evident that the admiral is the\nforemost ship, whilst bearing away, although she would be the last in\nboth lines, if they were close-hauled Fig 13 expresses the order of retreat, which is frequently practised\nby the French, and is directly the reverse of this; because the angular\n\n\npoint is farthest to leeward in the former, whereas it is to windward of\nboth lines in the latter; being also the headmost of both, when close-\nhauled, although the sternmost ship while they are bearing away In an engagement, the ships are generally brought-to, with the main-\ntop-sails laid aback, and their fore-top-sails full, for the purpose of\nbearing away more readily, when occasion requires This disposition\nof the sails is represented in fig 13 plate III See also Lying-to The line is said to be formed abreast, when the ships sides are all\nparallel to each other, on a line which crosses their keels at right\nangles This is more frequently used in pursuing or retreating, with\nthe wind right aft, so that the line forms a perpendicular with the\ndirection of the wind, as exhibited by the ships C, in the plan annexed\nto fig",
    "This is more frequently used in pursuing or retreating, with\nthe wind right aft, so that the line forms a perpendicular with the\ndirection of the wind, as exhibited by the ships C, in the plan annexed\nto fig 10 10 Line is also a name given to several small cords, of different sizes,\nand used for various purposes at sea; as house-line, marline, rattling-\nline, &c Line is also a name given to several small cords, of different sizes,\nand used for various purposes at sea; as house-line, marline, rattling-\nline, &c See those articles LINTSTOCK, baton à feu, a staff about three feet long, having a\nsharp point at one end, and a sort of fork or crotch in the other; the\nlatter of which serves to contain a lighted match, and by the former\nthe lintstock is occasionally stuck in the deck, in an upright position It is frequently used in small vessels, in an engagement, where there is\ncommonly one fixed between every two guns, by which the match is\nalways kept dry and ready for firing LOADING See the articles Cargo and Lading Shot-LOCKER See Garland LOG, a machine used to measure the ship’s head-way, or the rate of\nher velocity as she advances through the sea It is composed of a reel\nand line, to which is fixed a small piece of wood, forming the\nquadrant of a circle The term log however is more particularly\napplied to the latter The log, fig 14, plate V is generally about a quarter of an inch\nthick, and five or six inches from the angular point a to the\ncircumference b It is balanced by a thin plate of lead, nailed upon the\narch, so as to swim perpendicularly in the water, with about ⅔\nimmersed under the surface The line is fastened to the log by means\nof two legs a and b, fig 15, one of which passes through a hole a at\nthe corner, and is knotted on the opposite side; whilst the other leg is\nattached to the arch by a pin b, fixed in another hole, so as to draw\nout occasionally By these legs the log is hung in equilibrio, and the\nline, which, is united to it, is divided into certain spaces, which are in\n\n\nproportion to an equal number of geographical miles, as a half minute\nor quarter minute is to an hour of time This instrument is employed to measure the ship’s course in the\nfollowing manner: The reel, fig 16, about which the log-line is\nwound, being held by one man, and the half-minute glass by another,\nthe mate of the watch at the same time fixes the pin, and throws the\nlog over the stern, which, swimming perpendicularly in the sea, feels\nan immediate resistance as the ship advances To prevent the pin from\nbeing drawn by the effort of this resistance, the person who heaves\nthe log continually slackens the line over the stern, or quarter, so that\nit becomes almost straight on the water, and the log continues nearly\nin the same place where it first alighted, and is considered as fixed\ntherein The knots are measured from a mark fastened at the distance\nof 12 or 15 fathoms from the log; the glass is therefore turned at the\ninstant when this mark passes over the stern, and as soon as the glass\nruns out, the line is accordingly stopped; when the water, acting\nforcibly on the surface of the log, immediately dislodges the pin, so\nthat the log, no longer resisting the effort of the water, is easily drawn\naboard The degree of the ship’s velocity is then readily determined,\nby examining the number of knots nearest to that part of the line,\nwhere it was stopped at the expiration of the glass, as the knots\nincrease in their natural order from the mark above mentioned The\nspace comprehended between that mark and the log is used to let the\nlatter be far enough astern, to be out of the eddy of the ship’s wake\nwhen the glass is turned If the glass runs thirty seconds, the distance between the knots\nshould be fifty feet When it runs more or less, it should therefore be\ncorrected by the following analogy: As 30 is to 50, so is the number of\nseconds of the glass to the distance between the knots upon the line As the heat or moisture of the weather has often a considerable effect\non the glass, so as to make it run slower or faster, it should be\nfrequently tried by the vibrations of a pendulum The line, being also\nliable to relax or shrink from the same cause, ought likewise to be\nmeasured, as occasion requires It is usual to heave the log once every hour in ships of war and\nEast-India men; and in all other vessels, once in two hours; and if at\nany time of the watch, the wind has increased or abated in the\nintervals, so as to affect the ship’s velocity, the officer generally makes\na suitable allowance for it, at the close of the watch LOG-BOARD, a sort of table, divided into several columns,\n\n\ncontaining the hours of the day and night, the direction of the winds,\nthe course of the ship, and all the material occurrences that happen\nduring the twenty-four hours, or from noon to noon; together with the\nlatitude by observation From this table the different officers of the\nship are furnished with materials to compile their journals, wherein\nthey likewise insert whatever may have been omitted; or reject what\nmay appear superfluous in the log-board See the article Journal Log-Book, a book into which the contents of the log-board is daily\ncopied at noon, together with every circumstance deserving notice,\nthat may happen to the ship, or within her cognizance, either at sea or\nin a harbour, &c The intermediate divisions or watches of the log-\nbook, containing four hours each, are usually signed by the\ncommanding officer thereof, in ships of war or East-Indiamen LONG-BOAT, chaloupe, the largest and strongest boat belonging to\nany ship It is principally employed to carry great burthens, as\nanchors, cables, ballast, &c See the article Boat LOOF, the after-part of a ship’s bow;

expressed of\n\n\na ship when she has either sunk at sea, or struck upon a rock, shelf, or\nlee-shore, where she has beat to pieces by the violence of the sea LOW-WATER, that state of the tide, in which the reflux has fallen to\nits greatest depression from the sea-coasts, or rivers of any country See the article Tide To LOWER, amener, to ease down gradually, expressed of some\nweighty body, which is suspended by tackles, or other ropes, which,\nbeing slackened, suffer the said body to descend as slowly or\nexpeditiously as the occasion requires Hence\nLower handsomely and lower cheerly are opposed to each other,\nthe former being the order to lower gradually, and the latter to lower\nexpeditiously LUFF, lof, the order from the pilot to the steersman to put the helm\ntowards the lee-side of the ship, in order to make the ship sail nearer\nthe direction of the wind Hence, luff round, or luff alee, envoie, lof\ntout, is the excess of this movement, by which it is intended to throw\nthe ship’s head up in the wind, in order to tack her, &c A ship is accordingly said to spring her luff, faire une olofée, when\nshe yields to the effort of the helm, by sailing nearer to the line of the\nwind than she had done before See also Hauling the wind, and\nSteering Luff-Tackle, a name given by sailors to any large tackle that is not\ndestined for a particular place, but may be variously employed as\noccasion requires It is generally somewhat larger than the jigger-\ntackle, although smaller than those which serve to hoist the heavier\nmaterials into and out of the vessel; which latter are the main and\nfore-tackles, the stay and quarter-tackles, &c LUG-SAIL, treou, a square sail, hoisted occasionally on the mast of a\nboat, or small vessel, upon a yard which hangs nearly at right angles\nwith the mast These are more particularly in the barca longas,\nnavigated by the Spaniards in the Mediterranean LYING-TO, or Lying-by, en panne, the situation of a ship when she\nis retarded in her course, by arranging the sails in such a manner as to\ncounteract each other with nearly an equal effort, and render the ship\nalmost immoveable, with respect to her progressive motion, or head-\nway A ship is usually brought-to by the main and fore-top-sails, one of\nwhich is laid aback, whilst the other is full; so that the latter pushes\nthe ship forward, whilst the former resists this impulse, by forcing her\nastern This is particularly practised in a general engagement, when\nthe hostile fleets are drawn up in two lines of battle opposite each\n\n\nother It is also used to wait for some other ship, either approaching\nor expected; or to avoid pursuing a dangerous course, especially in\ndark or foggy weather, &c Lying-to in a storm See the article Trying M MAGAZINE, soute au poudres, a close room or store-house, built in the\nfore, or after-part of a ship’s hold, to contain the gun-powder used in\nbattle, &c This apartment is strongly secured against fire, and no\nperson is suffered to enter it with a lamp or candle: it is therefore\nlighted, as occasion requires, by means of the candles or lamps which\nare fixed in the light-room contiguous to it See that article MAGNET See the article Compass MAIN, an epithet usually applied by sailors to whatever is principal,\nas opposed to what is inferior or secondary Thus the main land is\nused in contradistinction to an island or peninsula; and the main-\nmast, the main-wale, the main-keel, and the main-hatchway, are in\nlike manner distinguished from the fore and mizen-masts, the\nchannel-wales, the false-keel, and the fore and after-hatchways, &c As the sails, yards, and rigging of the main-mast, are all described\nin their proper places, namely, under those particular articles, to\nwhich the reader is referred, it will be unnecessary to say any thing\nfarther of them here To MAKE, is variously applied, in the sea-language, to the land, to\nthe sails, to the ship’s course, &c To Make a good board See the article Board To Make the land, decouvrir, is to discover it from a distant\nsituation, in consequence of approaching it after a sea-voyage: as, “In\nyour passage to cape Tiburon, it will be necessary to make Turk’s\nIsland ”\nTo Make sail, faire plus de voiles, is to increase the quantity of sail\nalready extended, either by letting out the reefs, and by hoisting an\nadditional number of small sails, or by performing either of those\nexercises separately To Make sternway, aller en arriere, is to retreat or move with the\nstern foremost To Make water, faire eau, usually signifies to leak, unless when the\nepithet foul is added thereto A ship is said to make foul water, when\nrunning in shallow water, her keel disturbs and loosens the mud or\nooze, lying at the bottom thereof MALLET, a sort of wooden hammer, of which there are several sorts\nused for different purposes on ship-board, as the\nCalking-Mallet, an implement chiefly employed to drive the\n\n\noakum into the seams of a ship, where the edges of the planks are\njoined to each other in the sides, decks, or bottom The head of this mallet is long and cylindrical, being hooped with\niron to prevent it from splitting in the exercise of calking Serving-Mallet, a mallet used in serving the rigging, by binding the\nspun-yarn more firmly about it, than could possibly be done by hand;\nwhich is performed in the following manner: the spun-yarn being\npreviously rolled up in a large ball, or clue, two or three turns of it are\npassed about the rope and about the body of the mallet, which for this\npurpose is furnished with a round channel in its surface, that\nconforms to the convexity of the rope intended to be served The turns\nof the spun-yarn being strained round the mallet, so as to confine it\nfirmly to the rope, which is extended above the deck, one man passes\nthe ball continually about the rope, whilst the other, at the same time,\nwinds on the spun-yarn by means of the mallet, whose handle acting\nas a lever, strains every turn about the rope as firm as possible MANGER, gatte, a small apartment, extending athwart the lower-\ndeck of a ship of war, immediately within the hause-holes, and fenced\non the afterpart by a partition, which separates it from the other part\nof the deck behind it This partition serves as a fence to interrupt the passage of the\nwater, which occasionally gushes in at the hause-holes, or falls from\nthe wet cable whilst it is heaved in by the capstern The water, thus\nprevented from running aft, is immediately returned into the sea, by\nseveral small channels, called scuppers, cut through the ship’s side\nwithin the manger The manger is therefore particularly useful in giving a contrary\ndirection to the water that enters at the hause-holes, which would\notherwise run aft in great streams upon the lower deck, and render it\nextremely wet and uncomfortable, particularly in tempestuous\nweather, to the men who mess and sleep in different parts thereof MARINE, a general name for the navy of a kingdom or state; as also\nthe whole œconomy of naval affairs; or whatever respects the\nbuilding, rigging, arming, equipping, navigating, and fighting ships It\ncomprehends also the government of naval armaments, and the state\nof all the persons employed therein, whether civil or military Marines, or Marine-Forces, a body of troops employed in the\nsea-service, under the direction of the lords of the admiralty MARLINE, (merlin, Fr ) a small line, somewhat less than house-line,\nand used for the same purposes See House-Line MARLING, the act of winding any small line, as marline, spun-yarn,\npackthread, &c about a rope, so that every turn is secured by a sort of\nknot, so as to remain fixed in case all the rest should be cut through\nby friction, &c This expedient is much preferable to the winding a\nline spirally about a rope for the same purpose, because as the turns\nare at some distance from each other, the same quantity of line will\nserve for the one method as the other; with this difference, that if one\nof the spiral turns are cut through, the whole will be rendered useless,\nwhereas by marling, this is entirely prevented Marling is commonly used to fasten slips of canvas, called parsling,\nupon the surface of a rope, to prevent it from being galled by another\nrope that rubs against it, to attach the foot of a sail to its bolt-rope,\n&c Marling-Spike, epissoir, an iron pin, tapering to a point, and\nfurnished with a large round head It is principally used to penetrate\nthe twists, or strands of a rope, in order to introduce the ends of some\nother through the intervals, in the act of knotting or splicing It is also used as a lever, on many other occasions, about the\nrigging, particularly in fixing the seizings upon the shrouds, block-\nstrops, clues of the sails, &c To MAROON, deserter, to put one or more sailors ashore upon a\ndesolate island, under pretence of their having committed some great\ncrime This detestable expedient has been repeatedly practised by\nsome inhuman commanders of merchant-ships, particularly in the\nWest-Indies MAST, mât, a long round piece of timber, elevated perpendicularly\nupon the keel of a ship, to which are attached the yards, the sails, and\nthe rigging A mast, with regard to its length, is either formed of one single\npiece, which is called a pole-mast, or composed of several pieces\njoined together, each of which retains the name of mast separately The lowest of these is accordingly named the lower-mast, a, fig 1 plate VI the next in height is the top-mast, b, which is erected at the\nhead of the former; and the highest is the top-gallant-mast, c, which is\nprolonged from the upper end of the top-mast Thus the two last are\nno other than a continuation of the first upwards The lower-mast is fixed in the ship by an apparatus, described in\nthe articles hulk and sheers: the foot, or heel of it, rests in a block of\ntimber called the step, which is fixed upon the kelson; and the top-\nmast is attached to the head of it by the cap and the tressel-trees The\n\n\nlatter of these are two strong bars of timber, supported by two\nprominencies, which are as shoulders on the opposite sides of the\nmast, a little under its upper end: athwart these bars are fixed the\ncross-trees, upon which the frame of the top is supported Between the\nlower mast-head, and the foremost of the cross-trees, a square space\nremains vacant, the sides of which are bounded by the two tressel-\ntrees Perpendicularly above this is the foremost hole in the cap,\nwhose after-hole is solidly fixed on the head of the lower-mast The\ntop-mast is erected by a tackle, whose effort is communicated from\nthe head of the lower mast to the foot of the top-mast; and the upper\nend of the latter is accordingly guided into, and conveyed up through,\nthe holes between the tressel-trees and the cap, as above mentioned The machinery by which it is elevated, or, according to the sea-\nphrase, swayed-up, is fixed in the following manner: the top rope d,\nfig",
    "The machinery by which it is elevated, or, according to the sea-\nphrase, swayed-up, is fixed in the following manner: the top rope d,\nfig 2 passing through a block e, which is hooked on one side of the\ncap, and afterwards through a hole, furnished with a sheave or pulley\nf, in the lower end of the top-mast, is again brought upwards on the\nother side of the mast, where it is at length fastened to an eye-bolt in\nthe cap g, which is always on the side opposite to the top-block e To\nthe lower end of the top-rope is fixed the top-tackle h, the effort of\nwhich being transmitted to the top-rope d, and thence to the heel of\nthe top-mast f, necessarily lifts the latter upwards, parallel to the\nlower-mast When the top-mast is raised to its proper height, fig 3 3 the lower end of it becomes firmly wedged in the square hole, above\ndescribed, between the tressel-trees A bar of wood, or iron, called the\nfid, is then thrust through a hole i in the heel of it, across the tressel-\ntrees, by which the whole weight of the top-mast is supported In the same manner as the top-mast is retained at the head of the\nlower-mast, the top-gallant-mast is erected, and fixed at the head of\nthe top-mast Besides the parts already mentioned in the construction of masts,\nwith respect to their length, the lower-masts of the largest ships are\ncomposed of several pieces united into one body As these are\ngenerally the most substantial parts of various trees, a mast, formed\nby this assemblage, is justly esteemed much stronger than one\nconsisting of any single trunk, whose internal solidity may be very\nuncertain The several pieces are formed and joined together, as\nrepresented in the section of a lower-mast of this sort, fig 4 plate VI where a is the shaft, or principal piece into which the rest are fixed,\nwith their sides or faces close to each other The whole is secured by\n\n\nseveral strong hoops of iron, driven on the outside of the mast, a, fig 1 where they remain at proper distances The principal articles to be considered in equipping a ship with\nmasts are, 1st, the number; 2d, their situation in the vessel; and 3d,\ntheir height above the water The masts being used to extend the sails by means of their yards, it\nis evident that if their number were multiplied beyond what is\nnecessary, the yards must be extremely short, that they may not\nentangle each other in working the ship, and by consequence their\nsails will be very narrow, and receive a small portion of wind If, on\nthe contrary, there is not a sufficient number of masts in the vessel,\nthe yards will be too large and heavy, so as not to be managed\nwithout difficulty There is a mean between these extremes, which\nexperience and the general practice of the sea have determined; by\nwhich it appears, that in large ships, every advantage of sailing is\nretained by three masts and a bowsprit The most advantageous position of the masts is undoubtedly that\nfrom whence there results an equilibrio between the resistance of the\nwater, on the body of the ship, on one part, and of the direction of\ntheir effort on the other By every other position this equilibrio is\ndestroyed, and the greatest effort of the masts will operate to turn the\nship horizontally about its direction; a circumstance which retards her\nvelocity It is counterbalanced indeed by the helm; but the same\ninconvenience still continues; for the force of the wind, having the\nresistance of the helm to overcome, is not intirely employed to push\nthe vessel forward The axis of the resistance of the water should then\nbe previously determined, to discover the place of the main-mast, in\norder to suspend the efforts of the water equally, and place the other\nmasts so as that their particular direction will coincide with that of\nthe main-mast The whole of this would be capable of a solution, if the\nfigure of the vessel were regular, because the point, about which the\nresistance of the water would be in equilibrio, might be discovered by\ncalculation But when the real figure of the ship is considered, these flattering\nideas will instantly vanish This observation induced M Saverien to\nemploy a mechanical method to discover the axis of resistance of the\nwater, which he apprehended might be used with success in the\nmanner following:\nWhen the vessel is lanched, before the places of the masts are\ndetermined, extend a rope A B, fig",
    "Saverien to\nemploy a mechanical method to discover the axis of resistance of the\nwater, which he apprehended might be used with success in the\nmanner following:\nWhen the vessel is lanched, before the places of the masts are\ndetermined, extend a rope A B, fig 6 plate VI from the head to the\n\n\nstern To the extremities A and B attach two other ropes A D, B C, and\napply to the other ends of these ropes two mechanical powers, to\ndraw the ship according to the direction B C, parallel to itself The\nwhole being thus disposed, let a moveable tube Z, fixed upon the rope\nA B, have another rope Z R attached to it, whose other end\ncommunicates with a mechanical power R, equal to the two powers D\nand C This last being applied to the same vessel, in such manner as to\ntake off the effects of the two others by sliding upon the rope A B, so\nas to discover some point Z, by the parallelism of the ropes A D B C\nfeebly extended with the rope Z R; the line Z R will be the axis of the\nequilibrium of the water´s resistance, and by consequence the main-\nmast should be planted in the point Z The figures E, E, E, are three windlasses on the shore, by which this\nexperiment is applied With regard to the situation of the other masts, it is necessary, in\nthe same manner, to discover two points; so that the direction of the\ntwo mechanical powers operating, will be parallel to the axis of\nresistance R Z already found The exact height of the masts, in proportion to the form and size of\nthe ship, remains yet a problem to be determined The more the masts\nare elevated above the centre of gravity, the greater will be the\nsurface of sail, which they are enabled to present to the wind; so far\nan additional height seems to be advantageous But this advantage is\ndiminished by the circular movement of the mast, which operates to\nmake the vessel stoop to its effort; and this inclination is increased, in\nproportion to the additional height of the mast; an inconvenience\nwhich it is necessary to guard against Thus what is gained upon one\nhand is lost upon the other To reconcile these differences, it is\ncertain, that the height of the mast ought to be determined by the\ninclination of the vessel, and that the point of her greatest inclination\nshould be the term of this height, above the centre of gravity See the\narticle Trim With regard to the general practice of determining the height of the\nmasts, according to the different rates of the ships in the royal navy,\nthe reader is referred to the article Sail In order to secure the masts, and counterbalance the strain they\nreceive from the effort of the sails impressed by the wind, and the\nagitation of the ship at sea, they are sustained by several strong ropes,\nextended from their upper-ends to the outside of the vessel, called\nshrouds, see fig 5 plate VI They are further supported by other ropes, stretched from their\nheads towards the fore-part of the vessel See Rigging Plate vi The mast, which is placed at the middle of the ship’s length, is\ncalled the main-mast, grand-mât; that which is placed in the fore-part,\nthe foremast, mât de misaine; and that which is towards the stern is\ntermed the mizen-mast, mât d’artimon N B",

    "Happy if our efforts may in any degree\noperate to produce the effects for which they were calculated On his first entrance in a ship of war, every midshipman has several\ndisadvantageous circumstances to encounter These are partly\noccasioned by the nature of the sea-service, and partly by the\nmistaken prejudices of people in general, respecting naval discipline,\nand the genius of sailors and their officers No character, in their\nopinion, is more excellent than that of the common sailor, whom they\ngenerally suppose to be treated with great severity by his officers,\ndrawing a comparison between them not very advantageous to the\nlatter The midshipman usually comes aboard tinctured with these\nprejudices, especially if his education has been amongst the higher\nrank of people; and if the officers happen to answer his opinion, he\nconceives an early disgust to the service, from a very partial and\nincompetent view of its operations Blinded by these prepossessions,\n\n\nhe is thrown off his guard, and very soon surprized to find, amongst\nthose honest sailors, a crew of abandoned miscreants, ripe for any\nmischief or villainy Perhaps, after a little observation, many of them\nwill appear to him equally destitute of gratitude, shame, or justice,\nand only deterred from the commission of any crimes by the terror of\nsevere punishment He will discover, that the pernicious example of a\nfew of the vilest in a ship of war are too often apt to poison the\nprinciples of the greatest number, especially if the reins of discipline\nare too much relaxed, so as to foster that idleness and dissipation,\nwhich engender sloth, diseases, and an utter profligacy of manners If\nthe midshipman, on many occasions, is obliged to mix with these,\nparticularly in the exercises of extending or reducing the sails in the\ntops, he ought resolutely to guard against this contagion, with which\nthe morals of his inferiors may be infected He should however avail\nhimself of their knowledge, and acquire their expertness in managing\nand fixing the sails and rigging, and never suffer himself to be\nexcelled by an inferior He will probably find a virtue in almost every\nprivate sailor, which is entirely unknown to many of his officers: that\nvirtue is emulation, which is not indeed mentioned amongst their\nqualities by the gentleman of terra firma, by whom their characters\nare often copiously described with very little judgment There is\nhardly a common tar who is not envious of superior skill in his\nfellows, and jealous on all occasions to be out-done in what he\nconsiders as a branch of his duty Nor is he more afraid of the\ndreadful consequences of whistling in a storm, than of being\nstigmatized with the opprobious epithet of lubber Fortified against\nthis scandal, by a thorough knowledge of his business, the sailor will\nsometimes sneer in private, at the execution of orders, which to him\nappear aukward, improper, or unlike a seaman Nay, he will perhaps\nbe malicious enough to suppress his own judgment, and by a punctual\nobedience to command, execute whatever is to be performed, in a\nmanner which he knows to be improper, in order to expose the person\ncommanding to disgrace and ridicule Little skilled in the method of\nthe schools, he considers the officer who cons his lesson by rote as\nvery ill qualified for his station, because particular situations might\nrender it necessary for the said officer to assist at putting his own\norders in practice An ignorance in this practical knowledge will\ntherefore necessarily be thought an unpardonable deficiency by those\nwho are to follow his directions Hence the midshipman, who\nassociates with these sailors in the tops, till he has acquired a\n\n\ncompetent skill in the service of extending or reducing the sails, &c will be often entertained with a number of scurrilous jests, at the\nexpence of his superiors Hence also he will learn, that a timely\napplication to those exercises can only prevent him from appearing in\nthe same despicable point of view, which must certainly be a cruel\nmortification to a man of the smallest sensibility If the midshipman is not employed in these services, which are\nundoubtedly necessary to give him a clearer idea of the different parts\nof his occupation, a variety of other objects present themselves to his\nattention Without presuming to dictate the studies which are most\nessential to his improvement, we could wish to recommend such as\nare most suitable to the bent of his inclination Astronomy, geometry,\nand mechanics, which are in the first rank of science, are the\nmaterials which form the skilful pilot and the superior mariner The\ntheory of navigation is entirely derived from the two former, and all\nthe machinery and movements of a ship are founded upon the latter The action of the wind upon the sails, and the resistance of the water\nat the stem, naturally dictate an enquiry into the property of solids\nand fluids: and the state of the ship, floating on the water, seems to\ndirect his application to the study of hydrostatics and the effects of\ngravity A proficiency in these branches of science will equally enlarge\nhis views, with regard to the operations of naval war, as directed by\nthe efforts of powder, and the knowledge of projectiles The most\neffectual method to excite his application to those studies is, perhaps,\nby looking round the navy, to observe the characters of individuals By this enquiry he will probably discover, that the officer, who is\neminently skilled in the sciences, will command universal respect and\napprobation; and that whoever is satisfied with the despicable\nambition of shining the hero of an assembly, will be the object of\nuniversal contempt The attention of the former will be engaged in\nthose studies, which are highly useful to himself in particular, and to\nthe service in general The employment of the latter is to acquire\nthose superficial accomplishments, that unbend the mind from every\nuseful science, emasculate the judgment, and render the hero\ninfinitely more dextrous at falling into his station in the dance, than in\nthe line of battle Unless the midshipman has an unconquerable aversion to the\nacquisition of those qualifications, which are so essential to his\nimprovement, he will very rarely want opportunities of making a\nprogress therein Every step he advances in those meritorious\n\n\nemployments, will facilitate his accession to the next in order If the\ndunces, who are his officers or mess-mates, are rattling the dice,\nroaring bad verses, hissing on the flute, or scraping discord from the\nfiddle, his attention to more noble studies will sweeten the hours of\nrelaxation He should recollect that no example from fools ought to\ninfluence his conduct, or seduce him from that laudable ambition\nwhich his honour and advantage are equally concerned to pursue MIZEN, artimon, (misana, Ital ) the aftermost or hindmost of the\nfixed sails of a ship, extended sometimes by a gaff, and sometimes by\na yard which crosses the mast obliquely; the fore-end reaching almost\ndown to the deck, and the after-end being peeked up as high above\nthe middle of the yard, where it is attached to the mast The figure of\nthe mizen is accordingly a trapezia, or a parallelogram, one of whose\ncorners is cut off by a diagonal, extended from one of its sides to the\nopposite corner, which becomes the peek of the mizen See the article\nSail MIZEN-MAST, the mast upon which the mizen and its top-sail and\nstay-sails are supported, besides other sails, which are set\noccasionally, as the driver, ring-tail, &c See the article Mast The shrouds, stays, and back-stays of this mast, as well as all the\nrunning-rigging, together with its several yards and sails, being\ndescribed under the articles Shrowd, Stay, Yard, &c the reader is\nreferred thither for the explanations thereof, which are in general\napplicable also to the same furniture of both the other masts MOLE, a name given in the Mediterranean to a long pier, or\nartificial bulwark of masonry, extending obliquely across the entrance\nof a harbour, in order to break the force of the sea from the vessels\nwhich are anchored within Mole is also, although improperly, applied to the harbour or haven,\nwhich is formed by the bulwark above described, which is then\ndenominated the mole-head MONSOON, a name given to the periodical or trade-winds, which\nblow regularly in certain latitudes of the Indian ocean They continue\nfive or six months invariably in one direction, and then alter their\ncourse, and blow, during an equal space of time, from a different\npoint of the compass with the same uniformity MOORING, the act of confining and securing a ship in a particular\nstation, by chains or cables, which are either fastened to the adjacent\nshore, or to anchors in the bottom A ship may be either moored by the head, or by the head and stern;\n\n\nthat is to say, she may be secured by anchors before her, without any\nbehind: or she may have anchors out, both before and behind her; or\nher cables may be attached to posts, rings, or moorings, which answer\nthe same purpose When a ship is moored by the head with her own anchors, they are\ndisposed according to the circumstances of the place where she lies,\nand the time she is to continue therein Thus wherever a tide ebbs and\nflows, it is usual to carry one anchor out towards the flood, and\nanother towards the ebb, particularly where there is little room to\nrange about; and the anchors are laid in the same manner, if the\nvessel is moored head-and-stern in the same place The situation of\nthe anchors, in a road or bay, is usually opposed to the reigning\nwinds, or those which are most dangerous; so that the ship rides\ntherein with the effort of both her cables Thus if she rides in a bay, or\nroad, which is exposed to a northerly wind and heavy sea from the\nsame quarter, the anchors passing from the opposite bows ought to lie\neast and west from each other: hence both the cables will retain the\nship in her station with equal effort against the action of the wind and\nsea Moorings are usually an assemblage of anchors, chains, and\nbridles, laid athwart the bottom of a river, or haven, to ride the\nshipping contained therein The anchors, employed on this occasion, have rarely more than one\nfluke, which is sunk in the river near low-water mark Two anchors,\nbeing fixed in this manner, on the opposite sides of the river, are\nfurnished with a chain, extending across from one to the other In the\nmiddle of the chain is a large square link, whose lower end terminates\nin a swivel, which turns round in the chain as about an axis,\nwhenever the ship veers about with the change of the tide To this\nswivel-link are attached the bridles, which are short pieces of cable,\nwell served, whose upper ends are drawn into the ship, at the\nmooring-ports, and afterwards fastened to the masts, or cable-bits A great number of moorings, of this sort, are fixed in the royal\nports, or the harbours adjacent to the king’s dock-yards, as Deptford,\nChatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth, &c MORTAR, a piece of artillery, shorter and wider than the cannon,\nand having a chamber different from the size of its bore Mortars are used in the attack of a fortified place, by sea, to\ndischarge bombs or carcases amongst the buildings The bomb is a\ngreat hollow ball, filled with powder, which, falling into the works of\n\n\na fortification, &c destroys the most substantial buildings by its\nweight; and, bursting asunder, creates the greatest disorder and\nmischief by its splinters The chambers of mortars are extremely different in their figures,\nand each of those figures is defended by better or worse arguments Thus they are spherical, cylindrical, conical, bottled, or concave In\nreality, nothing appears to be less determined upon true principles or\nexperiments than the proportions of the several parts of a mortar[39] As the sea-mortars, or those which are fixed in the bomb-vessels,\nare generally fixed at a much greater distance than is ever required\nashore, they are made somewhat longer, and much heavier, than the\nland-mortars",
    "As the sea-mortars, or those which are fixed in the bomb-vessels,\nare generally fixed at a much greater distance than is ever required\nashore, they are made somewhat longer, and much heavier, than the\nland-mortars Plate VI fig 7 represents a sea-mortar, the principal parts of which\nare, A, the chace; B, the reinforce; C, the breech; and D, the trunnions The interior part, comprehended between the dotted lines, is called\nthe bore, wherein the bomb is lodged; and the inner part of the bore,\nwhich is diminished towards the breech, and contains the powder, is\ntermed the chamber Mr Mr Muller, in his Treatise of Artillery, very justly observes, that the\nbreech of our 13 inch sea-mortars is loaded with an unnecessary\nweight of metal The chamber thereof contains 32 pounds of powder,\nand at the same time they are never charged with more than 12 or 15\npounds, by the most expert officers, because the bomb-vessel is unable\nto bear the violent shock of their full charge Thus the action of the\npowder is diminished by the vacancy left in the chamber, which is\nnever above half filled As a charge of 12 or 15 pounds of powder at\nmost is therefore sufficient, it is evidently proved, by the theory of\npowder, that this will produce the greatest effect when discharged\nfrom a mortar with a cylindrical chamber, represented by fig 8 8 He\nalso proves, by a variety of experiments made by Captain Desaguliers\nand himself, that the conical chamber, now used, is considerably\ninferior to the cylindrical one with the last charge of powder To facilitate the use of the mortar, it is placed in a solid carriage of\ntimber, called the bed, whose different parts are strongly bolted\ntogether By means of this it is firmly secured in its situation, so that\nthe explosion of the powder may not alter its direction In the middle\nof the upper-side of this carriage, plate VI",
    "In the middle\nof the upper-side of this carriage, plate VI fig 9 are two semi-circular\nnotches, to receive the trunnions; over these are fixed two very strong\nbands of iron, called the cap-squares, a, the middle of which is bent\ninto a semi-circle, to embrace the trunnions, and keep them fast in the\n\n\nmortar-bed The cap-squares are confined to the timber-work by\nstrong pins of iron, called the eye-bolts, b, into whose upper ends are\ndriven the keys, chained beneath them On the fore-part of the bed a\npiece of timber is placed transversely, upon which rests the belly of\nthe mortar, or that part which contains the chamber The elevation of\nthis piece, which is called the bed-bolster, is represented by fig The elevation of\nthis piece, which is called the bed-bolster, is represented by fig 13 and the plan by fig 12 12 it is used to elevate and support the mortar\nwhilst firing These beds are placed upon very strong frames of timber, which are\nfixed in the bomb-ketch, and represented in fig These beds are placed upon very strong frames of timber, which are\nfixed in the bomb-ketch, and represented in fig 14 plate VI They are\nsecurely attached to the frames, by means of a strong bolt of iron, fig They are\nsecurely attached to the frames, by means of a strong bolt of iron, fig 15 15 called the pintle, passing perpendicularly through both, and\nafterwards through one of the beams of the vessel Thus the pintle,\nwhich passes through the hole in the centre of the plan, fig",

    "17 It is generally a\nconical tube, formed of beech, willow, or some dry wood, and filled\nwith a composition of sulphur, salt-petre, and mealed-powder The\n\n\nbomb being charged, this fuse is inserted in the cavity through the\nfuse-hole; and when fired, communicates the fire to the powder in the\nshell The fuses for bombs are charged with great care, that nothing may\nprevent them from communicating the fire to the powder in the\ncentre of the bomb They are driven into the shell so as that only\nabout an inch and a half comes out beyond the fuse-hole; and then the\nshell is said to be fixed These fuses are also charged long before there is occasion to use\nthem; and that the composition with which they are filled may not fall\nout, or be damaged, by growing damp, the two ends are covered with\na composition of tallow, mixed either with pitch or bees wax When\nthe fuse is to be put into the shell, the little end is opened or cut off;\nbut the great end is never opened till the mortar is to be fired[40] When the proper quantity of powder, necessary to charge the\nmortar, is put into the chamber, it is covered with a wad, well beat\ndown with the rammer After this the fixed shell is placed upon the\nwad, as near the middle of the mortar as possible, with the fuse-hole\nuppermost, and another wad pressed down close upon it, so as to keep\nthe shell firm in its position The officer then points the mortar, or\ngives it the inclination necessary to carry the bomb to the place\ndesigned When the mortar is thus fixed, the fuse is opened; the\npriming-iron is also thrust into the touch-hole of the mortar to clear it,\nafter which it is primed with the finest powder This done, two of the\nmatrosses, or sailors, taking each one of the matches, the first lights\nthe fuse, and the other fires the mortar The bomb, thrown out by the\nexplosion of the powder, is carried to the place intended; and the fuse,\nwhich ought to be exhausted at the instant of the shell’s falling,\ninflames the powder contained therein, and bursts the shell into\nsplinters; which, flying off circularly, occasion incredible mischief\nwheresoever they reach Necessary orders before a bombardment by sea When any fixed shells are issued from the tenders, the artillery\npeople on board are immediately to fix others in their room, and are\nalways to keep in their tenders the same number they had at first The shells are to be fixed in the boat appointed to carry them,\n\n\nprovided the weather permits;

but if any\nshould be left, when the service is over, they are immediately to be\nkitted The powder in the bomb-vessels is to be used first; and none to be\nopened or measured out, except in the captain’s cabin, the door of\nwhich is to be kept shut during the whole time, and covered with\ntanned hides, to make it as secure as possible The fixed shells in the boats are to be likewise covered from fire or\nwet with hair-cloth and tanned hides, with the utmost care If the service is carried on at night, all the powder is to be ready\nmeasured out in cartridges, which may be kept in the powder-\nmagazine and captain’s cabin, in the empty powder-barrels and\npowder-bags;

another, of a rope communicating with an assemblage of\nribs and trucks; a third, of a rope passing through several trucks,\nwithout any ribs; and the fourth, of a truss, by which the yard may be\nat any time slackened from the mast, or confined thereto as close as\npossible The first of these, which is also the simplest, is formed of a piece of\nrope, well covered with leather, or spun-yarn, and furnished with an\neye at each end The middle of it being passed round the middle of\nthe yard, both parts of it are fastened together on the after-side of the\nyard, and the two ends, which are equally long, are passed round the\nafter-part of the mast; and one of them being brought under, and the\nother over the yard, the two eyes are lashed together with a piece of\nspun-yarn on the fore-side thereof, whilst another lashing is employed\nto bind them together, behind the mast, according to the manner\ndescribed in the article Marling The second and most complicated are composed of ribs and trucks,\nthe former of which are long flat pieces of wood, having two holes\nnear their ends, bigots, as represented by fig a plate VIII the latter,\npommes, are small globular pieces, b, with a hole through the middle,\nof the same size with those of the ribs Between every two ribs are\nplaced two trucks, of which one is opposite to the upper hole, and the\nother to the lower holes of both ribs;

and thus it discharges, in a limited time, a much\ngreater quantity of water than the common pump, and that with less\nfatigue and inconvenience to the labourers This machine is nevertheless exposed to several disagreable\naccidents by the nature of its construction The chain is of too\ncomplicated a fabric, and the sprocket-wheels employed to wind it up\nfrom the ship’s bottom, are deficient in a very material circumstance,\nviz some contrivance to prevent the chain from sliding or jerking\nback upon the surface of the wheel, which frequently happens when\nthe valves are charged with a considerable weight of water, or when\nthe pump is violently worked The links are evidently too short, and\nthe immechanical manner in which they are connected, exposes them\nto a great friction in passing round the wheels Hence they are\nsometimes apt to break or burst asunder in very dangerous situations,\nwhen it is extremely difficult or impracticable to repair the chain The consideration of the known inconveniences of the above\nmachine has given rise to the invention of several others which should\nbetter answer the purpose They have been offered to the public one\nafter another with pompous recommendations by their respective\nprojectors, who have never failed to report their effects as\nconsiderably superior to that of the chain-pump with which they have\nbeen tried It is however much to be lamented, that in these sort of\ntrials there is not always a scrupulous attention to what may be called\nmechanical justice The artist who wishes to introduce a new piece of\nmechanism, has generally sufficient address to compare its effects\n\n\nwith one of the former machines which is crazy or out of repair A\nreport of this kind indeed favours strongly of the evidence of a false\nwitness, but this finesse is not always discovered The persons\nappointed to superintend the comparative effects of the different\npumps, have not always a competent knowledge of hydraulics to\ndetect these artifices, or to remark with precision the defects and\nadvantages of those machines as opposed to each other Thus the\nseveral inventions proposed to supplant the chain-pump have hitherto\nproved ineffectual, and are now no longer remembered Of late, however, some considerable improvements have been made\non the naval chain-pump, by Mr Cole, under the direction of Capt Bentinck",

    "See Anchor and Cable-Tier Range, is also the distance to which a bomb or cannon-ball is\n\n\nthrown from a piece of artillery, by the explosion of gun-powder See\nthe articles Cannon and Mortar The flight of a shot is distinguished, by artillery people, into two\ndifferent ranges, of which the first is called the point-blank; and the\nsecond, the random-shot To these also may be added the ricochet, or\nrolling and bounding-shot Whatever has been observed, in other parts of this work, with\nregard to the flight of a shot from a piece of artillery, is on the\npresumption that it describes a right line in its passage to the object This, however, is not strictly true; because by its weight it inclines to\nthe earth every instant of its motion: but as its velocity is very great\nwhen first discharged from the cannon, the weight does not sensibly\naffect the direction in the first instant of its motion Thus the line it\ndescribes, as represented in plate III extending from fig 16 16 to the\nship under sail, is apparently straight, and the extent of this line is\ncalled the point-blank range of the piece; which accordingly may be\ndefined the extent of the apparent right line, described by a ball\ndischarged from a cannon This range is much less than the greatest range, or random-shot; but\nthe piece cannot be levelled, or, as it is generally expressed, pointed at\nan object intended to be battered, if that object is not within the\ndistance of the point-blank range; for beyond that, the stroke is very\nuncertain A piece is said to fire at random-shot, when the breech rests upon\nthe bed of the carriage, so that the ball is carried to the greatest\npossible distance But as, in this method of firing, the ball cannot be\ndirected to any determinate object, it is rarely used in the sea-service,\nand only when the shot cannot fail of doing great execution in the\nplace whereon it falls Besides the two ranges above described, there is the ricochet[45],\ninvented by the Marshal de Vauban To fire a piece by way of the ricochet, the cannon is only charged\nwith a quantity of powder sufficient to carry the shot along the face of\nthe works attacked The shot, thus discharged, goes rolling and\nbounding, killing, maiming, or destroying all it meets in its course,\nand creates much more disorder by going thus slowly, than if thrown\nfrom the piece with greater violence When ricochet firing is used, the pieces are elevated from 3 to 6\ndegrees, and no more; because if the elevation is greater, the shot will\nonly drop into the work, without bounding from one place to another They are to be loaded with a small charge, and directed in such a\nmanner as just to go over the parapet[46] It was the opinion of engineers formerly, that by charging the\npieces high, the ball was thrown to a greater distance Hence the\npieces were charged with two thirds, or even the whole weight of the\nshot, in order to impel it with greater velocity; but it has been\ndiscovered since, that the half, or one third of the weight of the ball,\nis the fittest charge for the piece[47] If the whole quantity of powder, employed to charge the cannon,\ncould take fire at the same instant, it is apparent that the velocity,\ncommunicated to the shot, would increase in proportion to the\nadditional quantity of powder But though the time of its\ninflammation is very short, it may yet be conceived as divided into\nmany instants In the first instant, the powder begins to dilate and\nimpel the shot forward; and if it has force enough to expel it from the\npiece before the whole charge is inflamed, that part which is left to\ntake fire afterwards will produce no effect at all on the shot A charge\nof extraordinary force does not therefore accelerate the velocity of the\nbullet: and hence it follows that the piece ought to be charged with no\nmore powder, than will take fire whilst the ball is passing through the\nchace of the cannon It may not be amiss to observe here, that the range of cannon is\ngreater in the morning and at night, than at noon; and in cold, than in\nhot weather The reason is, that at these times the air being less\nheated, gives less way to the dilatation of the powder, which being by\nthis means confined, as it were, to a smaller sphere of action, must\nhave a stronger effect in proportion[48] “When the lengths of cannon are proportional to the height of the\ncharge, the shot will be discharged with the same velocity, whatever\nthe calibre may be; and since the ratios of the velocities of shots,\nissuing from pieces of different lengths, loaded with different charges\nof powder, will be of great use in the construction of cannon, we have\ncollected them in the following table, where the numbers at the top\nexpress the length of the pieces by the diameter of their shots That is,\nthe first is 12 diameters; the second 15, and so on The first\nperpendicular column expresses the charges, in respect to the weight\nof the shots: thus, ¼, ⅓, ½, ⅔ imply that the weight of the charge is\n¼, ⅓, ½, ⅔ of the weight of the shot The other numbers, in the same\nhorizontal lines, express the distance in feet moved over by the\nvelocities of the shot, uniformly continued in a second of time A Table\nof\nVelocities 12\n15\n18\n21\n24\n27\n30\n36\n¼\n1043\n1052\n1058\n1063\n1066\n1068\n1071\n1074\n⅓\n1186\n1200\n1210\n1217\n1222\n1224\n1229\n1234\n½\n1406\n1434\n1452\n1465\n1475\n1482\n1488\n1497\n⅔\n1568\n1613\n1641\n1662\n1677\n1688\n1698\n1711\n“We made use of the diameter of a 9 pound shot, which being 4\ninches, is more convenient in the calculation; and this diameter\nexpresses the height of the charge when it is a quarter of the weight of\nthe shot, and the rest in proportion “Several remarks may be made upon this table, which are of great\nimportance in the construction of cannon First, when the charge is\nbut a quarter of the shot’s weight, the difference between the\nvelocities, when the length is 12 and 15 diameters, is but 9 feet in a\nsecond; and the differences between the other velocities decrease as\nthe length increases “Hence, as the difference between the velocities when the piece is\n15 and 36 diameters long, is but 22 feet in a second, it is easily\nperceived, that when the pieces are charged with one quarter of the\nshot’s weight, the length from 12 to 15 diameters is the best “Secondly, When the charge is one third of the shot’s weight, the\ndifference of the velocities, when the piece is 12, 15, and 18\ndiameters long, are 14, 10 seconds; and from thence decrease more\nand more, as the length of the piece increases: so the length, from 15\nto 18 diameters seems to be the best, every thing being considered “Thirdly, and lastly, it appears, from the same manner of reasoning,\nthat when the charge is one-half of the shot’s weight, the length ought\nto be from 18 to 21 diameters; and when the charge is two thirds of\nthe shot’s weight, the length ought to be from 21 to 24 diameters ”\nMuller’s Artillery As one of the effects of the bomb results from its weight, the range\nof mortars is extremely different from that of cannon, because the\nformer is not pointed at a certain object, like the latter, but inclined to\nthe horizon at a certain angle; so that the bomb, being thrown up\nobliquely, much in the same direction as a tennis-ball struck by the\n\n\nracket, may fall upon the place intended Hence it appears that the\nmortar has no point-blank range, or at least that no use is made of it The mortar, being fixed in a situation obliquely with the horizon, so\nas that the line a c, which passes through the middle of it\nlongitudinally, being continued, would make an angle b a d with the\nhorizon a b; a bomb, discharged in the direction of this continued line,\nwould deviate from it every instant of its motion by its weight, which\ninclines it downwards, and by this means it would describe a curve-\nline, as a e b, called a parabola[49] The line a b, fig 19 plate VI",
    "plate VI is called the extent of the range, or\nthe amplitude of the parabola; and the line a d, the elevation of the\nmortar To make a bomb fall on a given place, two things are to be\nconsidered; viz the elevation of the mortar; and the quantity of\npowder used to charge it; both of which may be ascertained as\nfollows: A bomb discharged from a mortar, pointed vertically, will\ndescribe a line nearly perpendicular to the horizon: I say nearly,\nbecause the mortar will always have some little motion, which will\ndestroy the exact perpendicularity of the bomb’s flight; but abstracted\nfrom this, a bomb, discharged vertically, would fall again into the\nmortar[50] If the mortar be afterwards inclined more and more towards the\nhorizon, the bomb will fall still farther and farther distant from the\nmortar, till the elevation rests at 45°; and the more the mortar is\npointed under this angle, the more will the range of the bomb be\ndiminished: all of which is strictly demonstrated by geometry But the\nfollowing is a very simple manner of conceiving it, without having\nrecourse to that science A bomb, discharged in the direction of a line, nearly perpendicular\nto the horizon, will fall at a little distance from the bomb-vessel This\nrequires no proof A bomb, thrown according to a line that makes a\nvery acute angle with the horizon, will presently come to the ground\nby its weight, and by consequence will not, any more than the other,\nfall at a considerable distance from the mortar Hence it is easy to conceive, that in order to fall at the greatest\ndistance from the mortar, the bomb must be fired according to an\nelevation at the greatest possible distance, as well from a vertical, as\nfrom an horizontal line This elevation divides in two equal parts the\nangle formed by the vertical and horizontal lines, which being of 90\ndegrees, or what is called a right angle, a bomb will be thrown to the\n\n\ngreatest distance, in the direction of a line making an angle of 45\ndegrees For above this angle the range will diminish, because the\nbomb approaches the vertical line; and under the same elevation it\nwill also decrease, because the flight of the bomb approaches the\nhorizontal line Hence also it appears that there are two angles, according to which\na mortar may be inclined to make the bomb fall on the same place;\nthese are the angles, equally distant from the line, which cuts the\nquadrant into two equal parts: so that if, for example, a mortar is\nelevated at 30°, the bomb will fall at the same distance as if it had\nbeen elevated at 60°, each of these angles being 15° distant on this,\nand that side of the quadrant; that is, from the angle of 45 degrees The second thing to be considered, is, to know the exact charge of\npowder necessary to throw a bomb to a given distance If the bomb, being fired at an elevation of 45°, falls short of the\nplace intended, the charge of powder must be increased If it reaches\nthe place, or goes beyond it, it is evident that the charge is sufficient If the bomb, at an elevation under 45°, fall short of the place\nintended, with a given charge, the mortar must be more elevated: if,\non the contrary, it falls too far off, it must be more inclined to the\nhorizon: and by these essays the proper degree of inclination may be\neasily and speedily discovered If the mortar then is raised above 45°, it must be more inclined, so\nas to make a more acute angle with the horizon, to increase the range\nof the bomb; and, on the contrary, raised nearer a perpendicular, to\ndiminish it: all of which are consequences drawn from what has been\nsaid on this subject It must be observed, first, that the greatest distance to which a\nbomb can be thrown, with the strongest charge, is little more than\nabout 1800, or 2000 fathoms Secondly, that though a mortar may be elevated indifferently, either\nso much above or below 45° as to carry a bomb to a given distance,\nyet when any building is to be destroyed, it should be raised above\n45°, because the shell, rising to a greater height when fired according\nto a greater angle, falls with greater force, and by consequence will do\nmore damage to the place on which it is thrown But when the\nbusiness is to fire on a body of men, the mortar must be pointed\nbelow 45°, that the bomb may not have force enough to enter far into\nthe ground, and that the splinters in the explosion may do more\nexecution Practice\nfor Sea-\nMortars Nature\nof the\nMortar",

as sloops of war, armed ships, bomb-ketches, fire-ships\nand cutters, or schooners commanded by lieutenants Ships of the first rate mount 100 cannon, having 42 pounders on\nthe lower deck, 24 pounders on the middle deck, 12 pounders on the\nupper deck, and 6 pounders on the quarter deck and forecastle They\nare manned with 850 men, including their officers, seamen, marines,\nand servants In general, the ships of every rate, besides the captain, have the\nmaster, the boatswain, the gunner, the chaplain, the purser, the\nsurgeon, and the carpenter; all of whom, except the chaplain, have\ntheir mates or assistants, in which are comprehended the sail-maker,\nthe master at arms, the armorer, the captain’s clerk, the gunsmith, &c The number of other officers are always in proportion to the rate of\nthe ship Thus a first rate has six lieutenants, six master’s mates,\ntwenty-four midshipmen, and five surgeon’s mates, who are\nconsidered as gentlemen; besides the following petty officers: quarter-\nmasters, and their mates, fourteen; boatswains mates and yeomen,\neight; gunners mates and assistants, six; quarter-gunners, twenty-five;\ncarpenters mates, two, besides fourteen assistants; with one steward,\nand steward’s mate to the purser If the dimensions of all ships of the same rate were equal, it would\nbe the simplest and most perspicuous method to collect them into one\npoint of view in a table; but as there is no invariable rule for the\n\n\ngeneral dimensions, it must suffice to remark those of some particular\nships in each rate; for which purpose we have selected some of the\nlatest construction The Victory, which is the last built of our first rates, is 222 feet 6\ninches in length, from the head to the stern; the length of her keel,\n151 feet 3 inches; that of her gun-deck, or lower deck, 186 feet; her\nextreme breadth is 51 feet 10 inches; her depth in the hold, 21 feet 6\ninches; her burthen 2162 tons; and her poop reaches 6 feet before the\nmizen-mast Ships of the second rate carry 90 guns upon three decks, of which\nthose on the lower battery are 32 pounders; those on the middle, 18\npounders; on the upper-deck, 12 pounders; and those on the quarter-\ndeck, 6 pounders, which usually amount to four or six Their\ncomplement of men is 750, in which there are six lieutenants, four\nmaster’s mates, twenty-four midshipmen, and four surgeon’s mates,\nfourteen quarter-masters and their mates, eight boatswain’s mates and\nyeomen, six gunner’s mates and yeomen, with twenty-two quarter-\ngunners, two carpenter’s mates, with ten assistants, and one steward\nand steward’s mate Ships of the third rate carry from 64 to 80 cannon, which are 32,\n18, and 9 pounders The 80–gun ships however begin to grow out of\nrepute, and to give way to those of 74, 70, &c which have only two\nwhole batteries; whereas the former have three, with 28 guns planted\non each, the cannon of their upper-deck being the same as those on\nthe quarter-deck and fore-castle of the latter, which are 9 pounders The complement in a 74 is 650, and in a 64, 500 men; having, in\npeace, 4 lieutenants, but in war, 5; and when an admiral is aboard, 6 They have 3 master’s mates, 16 midshipmen, 3 surgeon’s mates, 10\nquarter-masters and their mates, 6 boatswain’s mates and yeomen, 4\ngunner’s mates and yeomen, with 18 quarter-gunners, 1 carpenter’s\nmate, with 8 assistants, and 1 steward and steward’s mate under the\npurser Ships of the fourth rate mount from 60 to 50 guns, upon two decks,\nand the quarter-deck The lower tier is composed of 24 pounders, the\nupper tier of 12 pounders, and the cannon on the quarter-deck and\nfore-castle are 6 pounders The complement of a 50 gun ship is 350\nmen, in which there are three lieutenants, 2 master’s mates, 10\nmidshipmen, 2 surgeon’s mates, 8 quarter-masters and their mates, 4\nboatswain’s mates and yeomen, 1 gunner’s mate and 1 yeoman, with\n12 quarter-gunners, 1 carpenter’s mate and 6 assistants, and a steward\nand steward’s mate All vessels of war, under the fourth rate, are usually comprehended\nunder the general name of frigates, and never appear in the line of\nbattle They are divided into the 5th and 6th rates, the former\nmounting from 40 to 32 guns, and the latter from 28 to 20 The\nlargest of the fifth rate have two decks of cannon, the lower battery\nbeing of 18 pounders, and that of the upper-deck of 9 pounders; but\nthose of 36 and 32 guns have only one complete deck of guns,\nmounting 12 pounders, besides the quarter-deck and fore-castle,\nwhich carry 6 pounders The complement of a ship of 44 guns, is 280\nmen and that of a frigate of 36 guns, 240 men The first has 3, and the\nsecond 2 lieutenants; and both have 2 master’s mates, 6 midshipmen,\n2 surgeon’s mates, 6 quarter-masters and their mates, 2 boatswain’s\nmates and 1 yeoman, 1 gunner’s mate and 1 yeoman, with 10 or 11\nquarter-gunners, and 1 purser’s steward Frigates of the 6th rate carry 9 pounders, those of 28 guns having 3\npounders on their quarter-deck, with 200 men for their complement;\nand those of 24, 160 men;

and the smallest, viz those of 8 and 10 guns, 4\npounders Their officers are generally the same as in the 6th rates,\nwith little variation; and their complements of men are from 120 to\n60, in proportion to their force or magnitude",

which were\nformerly esteemed incapable of government, unless in the most\nfavourable weather of the summer In testimony of this observation\nwe may, with great propriety, produce the example of the Royal\nGeorge, which, during the whole course of the late war, was known to\nbe as easily navigated, and as capable of service, as any of the inferior\nships of the line, and that frequently in the most tempestuous seasons\nof the year The ingenious M Du Hamel, who is eminently\ndistinguished for his knowledge of marine affairs, has indeed\njudiciously objected to the defects and bad qualities of such large\nships[51] It is nevertheless hardly possible for any Englishman, who\nwas witness to the defeat of M Conflans, by the victorious Sir Edward\nHawke, on the ever-memorable 20th of November, without dissenting\na while from that gentleman’s opinion In reality, a fact, confirmed by\nrepeated experience, must unavoidably triumph over all theoretical\nconclusions Ships of the second rate, and those of the third, which have three\ndecks, carry their sails remarkably well, and labour very little at sea They are excellent in a general action, or in cannonading a fortress Those of the third rate, which have two tiers, are fit for the line of\nbattle, to lead the convoys and squadrons of ships of war in action,\nand in general, to suit the different exigencies of the naval service The fourth rates may be employed on the same occasions as the\nthird rates, and may be also destined amongst the foreign colonies, or\non expeditions of great distance; since these vessels are usually\nexcellent for keeping and sustaining the sea Vessels of the fifth rate are too weak to suffer the shock of a line of\nbattle; but they may be destined to lead the convoys of merchant-\nships, to protect the commerce in the colonies, to cruize in different\nstations, to accompany squadrons, or be sent express with necessary\nintelligence and orders The same may be observed of the sixth rates The frigates, which mount from 28 to 38 guns upon one deck, with\nthe quarter-deck, are extremely proper for cruizing against privateers,\nor for short expeditions, being light, long, and usually excellent\nsailers RATTLINGS, enflechures, certain small lines which traverse the\nshrouds of a ship horizontally, at regular distances from the deck,\nupwards, and forming a variety of ladders, whereby to climb to any of\n\n\nthe mast-heads, or descend from them Hence the term is apparently\nderived from rath, an obsolete word, signifying an hill In order to prevent the rattling from slipping down by the weight of\nthe sailors, they are firmly attached by a knot, called a clove-hitch, to\nall the shrouds, except the foremost or aftmost; where one of the ends,\nbeing fitted with an eye-splice, is previously fastened with twine or\npackthread REACH, (ræcan, Sax ) the line, or distance, comprehended between\nany two points or stations on the banks of a river, wherein the current\nflows in a streight uninterrupted course REAR, (arriere, Fr ) a name given to the last division of a squadron,\nor the last squadron of a fleet, and which is accordingly commanded\nby the third officer of the said fleet or squadron See the article\nDivision REEF, ris, (reef, Dutch) a certain portion of a sail, comprehended\nbetween the top or bottom, and a row of eyelet-holes parallel thereto The intention of the reef is to reduce the surface of the sail in\nproportion to the increase of the wind; for which reason there are\nseveral reefs parallel to each other in the superior sails, whereby they\nmay be still farther diminished, in order to correspond with the\nseveral degrees of the gale Thus the top-sails of ships are usually\nfurnished with three reefs, l m n, fig 1 plate IX parallel to the yard;\nand there are always three or four reefs, parallel to the bottom on\nthose main-sails and fore-sails, which are extended upon booms: a\ncircumstance common to many of the small vessels Reef also implies a chain of rocks, lying near the surface of the\nwater REEF-BAND, a piece of canvas, sewed across the sail, to strengthen\nit in the place where the eyelet-holes of the reefs are formed REEFING, the operation of reducing a sail, by taking in one or more\nof the reefs, which is either performed by lines, points, or knittles Thus the top-sails are always, and the courses generally, reefed with\npoints, which are flat braided pieces of cordage, whose lengths are\nnearly double the circumference of the yard These being inserted in\nthe eyelet-holes, are fixed in the sail by means of two knots in the\nmiddle, one of which is before, and the other behind the reef-band In order to reef the top-sails with more facility and expedition, they\nare lowered down and made to shiver in the wind, which considerably\nrelaxes their tension The extremities of the reef are then drawn up to\nthe yard-arms by an assemblage of pullies communicating with the\n\n\ndeck, termed the reef-tackle; and they are securely fastened to the\nyard-arms by small cords, called earings The space of sail,\ncomprehended in the reef, is then laid smoothly over the yard, in\nseveral folds, or doubles: and the whole is completed by tying the\npoints about the yard, so as to bind the reef close up to it The courses of large ships are either reefed with points or small\ncords, which are thence called reef-lines In the latter case the line is\npassed spirally through the eyelet-holes of the reef, and over the head\nof the sail alternately, and afterwards strained as tight as possible It\nmust be observed, however, that the reef-line is sometimes passed\nround the yard, and sometimes only round the head of the sail; and\neach of these methods have their advocates, with arguments more or\nless convincing But if it should appear essential to prevent the friction\nby which a sail is galled between the line and the yard; and as the\nrope-bands are sufficient to sustain the effort of the sail, it is certainly\nmuch better to pass the line only round the sail, provided that the\nturns are inserted through the roband-legs; a circumstance which is\ncarefully practised by every skilful sailor The same reason may be alledged, with equal propriety, in favour\nof tying the points of the courses in the same manner; that is to say,\nthe after-end of the point should be thrust forward between the head\nof the sail and the yard; and the fore-leg of the said point should come\naft over the head of the sail, and also under the yard: and thus crossed\nover the head of the sail, the point should be extended, and the two\nends brought over the yard, and tied on the upper side of it as strait as\npossible When a sail is reefed at the bottom, it is done by knittles, which\nbeing thrust through the eyelet-holes thereof, are tied firmly about the\nspace of canvas of which the reef is composed, and knotted on the\nlower side of the bolt-rope These knittles are accordingly removed as\nsoon as the reef is let out Besides the manner above described, there are other methods of\nreducing a sail to the storm, as explained in the articles Goose-Wing\nand Balance REEF-TACKLE, a rope which passes from the deck to a block at the\ntopmast-head, and thence to another block at the topsail-yard-arm,\nwhere it communicates with another rope, called its pendant, that runs\ndownwards through a hole in the yard, and is afterwards attached to a\ncringle, a little below the lowest reef, as exhibited by fig 1 plate IX where b is the reef-tackle, and i the pendant thereof It is used, as we\n\n\nhave already observed, to pull the skirts of the reefs close up to the\nextremities of the topsail-yards, in order to lighten the sail, the weight\nof which would otherwise render it very difficult to perform this\noperation REEL of the log See the article Log To REEVE, is to pass the end of a rope through any hole, as the\nchannel of a block, the cavity of a thimble, cleat, ring-bolt, &c RECKONING See Dead-Reckoning REFITTING, is generally understood to imply the repairing any\ndamages, which a ship may have sustained in her sails or rigging, by\nbattle or tempestuous weather;

or to wait\nfor a fair wind, &c The excellence of a road consists chiefly in its being protected from\nthe reigning winds, and the swell of the sea; in having a good\nanchoring-ground, and being at a competent distance from the shore Those which are not sufficiently enclosed are termed open roads ROADER, a vessel riding at anchor in a road, bay, or river If a\nvessel under sail strikes against any roader, and damages her in\npassing, the former is obliged by law to make good the damages\nsustained by the latter The roaders attentively observe to anchor, or moor, at a competent\ndistance from each other; and that those which arrive last shall not\nmoor in the tract of the shipping which anchored before, so as to\nintercept their passage when they are ready to depart ROBANDS, or ROPE-BANDS See Rope-Band ROGUES-YARN, a name given to a rope-yarn, of a particular\nconstruction, which is placed, in the middle of every strand, in all\ncables and cordage in the king’s service It differs from all the rest, as\nbeing untarred, and twisted in a contrary manner, by which it is easily\ndiscovered The use of this contrivance is to examine whether any\ncordage, supposed to be stolen or embezzled, has been formed for the\nking’s service ROLLER, a cylindrical piece of timber, fixed either horizontally or\nperpendicularly above a ship’s deck, so as to revolve about an axis It\nis used to prevent the cables, hausers, &c from being chafed by the\n\n\nfriction which their surfaces would otherwise encounter, from bearing\nagainst that part of the ship, where the roller is placed, whilst they are\ndrawn into the ship, &c by mechanical powers Rollers, are also moveable pieces of wood, of the same figure,\nwhich are occasionally placed under planks, or long pieces of timber,\nin order to move them with greater facility either in the dock-yards, or\nin lading and delivering merchant-ships ROLLING, the motion by which a ship rocks from side-to side like a\ncradle, occasioned by the agitation of the waves Rolling, therefore, is a sort of revolution about an imaginary axis,\npassing through the center of gravity of a ship: so that the nearer the\ncenter of gravity is to the keel, the more violent will be the rolling-\nmotion; because the center about which the vibrations are made, is\nplaced so low in the bottom, that the resistance made by the keel to\nthe volume of water which it displaces in rolling, bears very little\nproportion to the force of the vibration above the center of gravity,\nthe radius of which extends as high as the mast-heads But if the center of gravity is placed higher above the keel, the\nradius of vibration will not only be diminished; but an additional\nforce to oppose the motion of rolling will be communicated to that\npart of the ship’s bottom which is below the center of gravity So far as relates to the effect of rolling, when produced by the\nquality or stowage of the ballast, and to the manner by which it may\nbe prevented, viz a change of the quantity or disposition of the\nballast, we shall endeavour to explain under the article Trim It may,\nhowever, be necessary to remark, that the construction of the ship’s\nbottom may also contribute to diminish this movement considerably To illustrate this by an example, let us suppose the section of a ship\nperpendicular to the keel to be exactly circular, plate VIII",
    "To illustrate this by an example, let us suppose the section of a ship\nperpendicular to the keel to be exactly circular, plate VIII fig 8 8 it is\nevident, that if this be agitated in the water, it will have nothing to\nsustain it, because the rolling or rotation about its center displaces no\nmore water than when it remains upright: consequently the rolling\nmotion must be very great in a high sea But if a plank is fixed below\nit edgeways, or perpendicular to the surface, as low as e, throughout\nthe whole length of the ship, it is plain that the plank e will displace a\nvolume of water to the right, when the ship is inclined to the left,\nwhich will retard her motion; and this obstruction will always act\ncontrary to her heeling or inclination to one side, and greatly diminish\nthe vibration or rolling; although it will add very little to her stiffness:\nFor, admitting the ship to incline to one side, as in fig 8 the plank d e\n\n\nwould produce a very weak effort to bring her upright But the depth\nof the keel, the rising of the floors, and the dead wood fore and aft, as\nin fig 9 plate VIII will answer the same purpose as the plank d e Many fatal disasters have happened to ships, arising from a violent\nrolling; as the loss of the masts, loosening of the cannon, and straining\nviolently on the decks and sides, so as to weaken the ship to a great\ndegree See Ballast, Labouring, and Pitching Rolling-tackle, a pulley or purchase fastened to that part of a\nsail-yard which is to the windward of the mast, in order to confine the\nyard close down to the leeward, when the sail is furled It is used to prevent the yard from having a great friction against\nthe mast in a high sea, which would be equally pernicious to both ROPES, cordes, (rap, Sax reep, Dutch) a general name given to all\nsorts of cordage, above one inch in circumference, used in the rigging\na ship See Cable, Hauser, Towline, and Warp Ropes are either cable-laid or hauser-laid: the former are composed\nof nine strands, viz three great strands, each of which is composed of\nthree smaller strands; and the latter is made with three strands, each\nof which contains a certain number of rope-yarns, in proportion to the\nsize of the rope required Rope-bands, rabans, pronounced roebins, certain pieces of small\nrope, or braided cordage, used to tie the upper edges of the great sails\nto their respective yards They are inserted through the eyelet-holes in\nthe head of the sail, being generally of a sufficient length to pass two\nor three times about the said yard Rope-yarn, fil de caret, the smallest and simplest part of any rope,\nbeing one of the threads of which a strand is composed; so that the\nsize of the latter, and of the rope into which it is twisted, are\ndetermined by the number of rope-yarns",

    "Thus the principal sail extended upon the main-\nmast is called the main-sail, grande voile, d, fig 2 plate IX ; the next\nabove, which stands upon the main-top-mast, is termed the main top-\nsail, grand hunier, e; and the highest, which is spread across the main-\ntop-gallant-mast, is named the main-top-gallant-sail, grand perroquet, f In the same manner there is the fore-sail, misaine, g; the fore-top-\nsail, petit hunier, h; and the fore-top-gallant-sail, petit perroquet, i; the\nmizen, artimon, k; the mizen top-sail, perroquet d’artimon, l; and mizen\ntop-gallant-sail m Thus also there is the main stay-sail o; main-top-\nmast stay-sail p; and main-top-gallant stay-sail q; with a middle stay-\nsail which stands between the two last N B All these stay-sails are\nbetween the main and fore masts The stay-sails (voiles d’etai) between the main-mast and mizen-mast\nare the mizen stay-sail r; and the mizen top-mast stay-sail s; and\nsometimes a mizen top-gallant stay-sail above the latter The stay-sails between the fore-mast and the bowsprit are the fore\nstay-sail t; the fore top-mast stay-sail u; and the jib, foc, x There is\nbesides two square sails extended by yards under the bowsprit, one of\nwhich is called the sprit-sail, civadiere, y; and the other the sprit-sail\ntop-sail z, perroquet de beaupré For the French names of all the stay-\nsails, see the French term Etai, and the phrases following it The studding-sails (bonnettes en étui) being extended upon the\ndifferent yards of the main-mast and fore-mast, are likewise named\naccording to their stations, the lower, top-mast, or top-gallant\nstudding sails The ropes by which the lower yards of a ship are hoisted up to their\nproper height on the masts, are called the jears In all other sails the\nropes employed for this purpose are called haliards The principal sails are then expanded by haliards, sheets, and\nbowlines, except the courses, which are always stretched out below by\na tack and sheet See Bowline, Close-hauled, &c They are drawn\nup together, or trussed up, by bunt-lines, clue-lines, d d, fig 1 ; leech-\nlines, e e; reef-tackles, f f; slab-line, g; and spilling-lines As the bunt-lines\nand leech-lines pass on the other side of the sail, they are expressed\nby dotted lines in the figure See those articles The courses, top-sails, and top-gallant sails, are wheeled about the\nmast, so as to suit the various directions of the wind, by braces The\nhigher studding-sails, and in general all the stay-sails, are drawn\ndown, so as to be furled, or taken in, by down-hauls See Brace,\nTrim, and Down-haul Sail is also a name applied to any vessel beheld at a distance under\nsail To set Sail, faire voile, is to unfurl and expand the sails, upon their\nrespective yards and stays, in order to begin the action of sailing To make Sail, is to spread an additional quantity of sail, so as to\nincrease the ship’s velocity To shorten Sail, is to reduce or take in part of the sails, with an\nintention to diminish the ship’s velocity To strike Sail, is to lower it suddenly This is particularly used in\nsaluting or doing homage to a superior force, or to one whom the law\nof nations acknowledges as superior in certain regions Thus all\nforeign vessels strike to an English man of war in the British seas See\n\n\nSalute SAILING, the movement by which a vessel is wafted along the\nsurface of the water, by the action of the wind upon her sails When a ship changes her state of rest into that of motion, as in\nadvancing out of a harbour, or from her station at anchor, she\nacquires her motion very gradually, as a body which arrives not at a\ncertain velocity till after an infinite repetition of the action of its\nweight Plate ix",
    "ix The first impression of the wind greatly affects the velocity, because\nthe resistance of the water might destroy it, since the velocity being\nbut small at first, the resistance of the water which depends on it will\nbe very feeble: but as the ship increases her motion, the force of the\nwind on the sails will be diminished; whereas on the contrary the\nresistance of the water on the bow will accumulate, in proportion to\nthe velocity with which the vessel advances Thus the repetition of the\ndegrees of force which the action of the sails adds to the motion of the\nship, is perpetually decreasing; whilst on the contrary the new degrees\nadded to the effort of resistance on the bow are always augmenting The velocity is then accelerated in proportion as the quantity added is\ngreater than that which is subtracted: but when the two powers\nbecome equal, when the impression of the wind on the sails has lost\nso much of its force, as only to act in proportion to the opposite\nimpulse of resistance on the bow, the ship will then acquire no\nadditional velocity, but continue to sail with a constant uniform\nmotion The great weight of the ship may indeed prevent her from\nacquiring her greatest velocity; but when she has attained it, she will\nadvance by her own intrinsic motion, without gaining any new degree\nof velocity, or lessening what she has acquired She moves then by her\nown proper force in vacuo, without being afterwards subject either to\nthe effort of the wind on the sails, or to the resistance of the water on\nthe bow If at any time the impulsion of the water on the bow should\ndestroy any part of the velocity, the effort of the wind on the sails will\nrevive it, so that the motion will continue the same It must however\nbe observed, that this state will only subsist when these two powers\nact upon each other in direct opposition; otherwise they will mutually\ndestroy one another The whole theory of working ships depends on\nthis counter-action, and the perfect equality which should subsist\nbetween the effort of the wind and the impulsion of the water Bouguer, Traité du navire The effect of sailing is produced by a judicious arrangement of the\nsails to the direction of the wind Accordingly the various modes of\nsailing are derived from the different degrees and situations of the\n\n\nwind with regard to the course of the vessel To illustrate this observation by examples, the plan of a number of\nships proceeding on various courses are represented by fig 3 plate IX which exhibits the thirty-two points of the compass, of which C is the\ncenter: the direction of the wind, which is northerly, being expressed\nby the arrow It has been observed in the article Close-hauled, that a ship in\nthat situation will sail nearly within six points of the wind Thus the\nships B and y are close-hauled, the former being on the larboard tack,\nsteering E N E and the latter on the starboard tack sailing W N W with their yards a b braced obliquely, as suitable to that manner of\nsailing The line of battle on the larboard tack would accordingly be\nexpressed by C B, and on the starboard by C y When a ship is neither close-hauled, nor steering afore the wind,\nshe is in general said to be sailing large The relation of the wind to\nher course is precisely determined by the number of points between\nthe latter and the course close-hauled Thus the ships c and x have the\nwind one point large, the former steering E b N and the latter W b\nN The yards remain almost in the same position as in B and y: the\nbowlines and sheets of the sails being only a little slackened The ships d and u have the wind two points large, the one steering\neast and the other west In this manner of sailing, however, the wind\nis more particularly said to be upon the beam, perpendiculaire du vent,\nas being at right angles with the keel, and coinciding with the position\nof the ship’s beams The yards are now more across the ship, the\nbowlines are cast off, and the sheets more relaxed; so that the effort of\nthe wind being applied nearer to the line of the ship’s course, her\nvelocity is greatly augmented In e and t the ships have the wind three points large, or one point\nabaft the beam, the course of the former being E b S and that of the\nlatter\nW b S The sheets are still more flowing; the angle which the yards\nmake with the keel farther diminished; and the course accelerated in\nproportion The ships f and s the first of which steers E S E and the second\nW S W have the wind four points large, or two points abaft the\nbeam In g and r the wind is five points large, or three points abaft the\nbeam, the former sailing S E b E and the latter S W b W In both\nthese situations the sheets are still farther slackened, and the yards\nlaid yet more athwart the ship’s length, in proportion as the wind\n\n\napproaches the quarter The ships h and q, steering S E and S W have the wind six points\nlarge, or more properly on the quarter; which is considered as the\nmost favourable manner of sailing, because all the sails co-operate to\nincrease the ship’s velocity: whereas, when the wind is right aft, as in\nthe ship m, it is evident, that the wind, in its passage to the foremost\nsails, will be intercepted by those which are farther aft When the\nwind is on the quarter, the fore-tack is brought to the cat-head; and\nthe main-tack being cast off, the weather-clue of the mainsail is\nhoisted up to the yard, in order to let the wind pass freely to the\nforesail; and the yards are disposed so as to make an angle of about\ntwo points, or nearly 22°, with the keel The ships i and p, of which the former sails S E b S and the latter\nS W, b S are said to have the wind three points on the larboard or\nstarboard quarter: and those expressed by k and o, two points; as\nsteering S S E and S S W in both which positions the yards make\nnearly an angle of 16°, or about a point and an half, with the ship’s\nlength When the wind is one point on the quarter, as in the ships l and n,\nwhose courses are S b E and S b W the situation of the yards and\nsails is very little different from the last mentioned; the angle which\nthey make with the keel being somewhat less than a point, and the\nstay-sails being rendered of very little service The ship m sails right\nafore the wind, or with the wind right aft In this position the yards\nare laid at right angles with the ship’s length: the stay-sails, being\nentirely useless, are hauled down: and the mainsail is drawn up in the\nbrails, that the fore-sail may operate: a measure which considerably\nfacilitates the steerage, or effort of the helm As the wind is then\nintercepted, by the main top-sail and main top-gallant-sail, in its\npassage to the fore top-sail and fore top-gallant-sail, these latter are by\nconsequence entirely becalmed, and might therefore be furled, to\nprevent their being fretted by flapping against the mast, but that their\neffort contributes greatly to prevent the ship from broaching-to, when\nshe deviates from her course to the right or left thereof Thus all the different methods of sailing may be divided into four,\nviz close hauled, large, quartering, and afore the wind; all which\nrelate to the direction of the wind with regard to the ship’s course,\nand the arrangement of the sails See also Drift and Leeway Order of Sailing, the general disposition of a fleet of ships when\nproceeding on a voyage or expedition It has already been observed in the article Fleet, that the most\nconvenient order of sailing, for a squadron of ships, is in three parallel\ncolumns, so as to form the line of battle with greater facility and\nexpedition In this disposition, the station of each ship is previously\nappointed by the commander in chief; and the ranks or columns are as\nnear to each other as regularity, and a regard for their common\nsecurity, will admit This distance, which ought to be carefully\nobserved in tacking, may be regulated by the movements of some of\nthe ships in the column farthest to windward, which should\naccordingly govern the operations of the whole squadron See\nTacking Sailing also implies a particular mode of navigation, formed on the\nprinciples, and regulated by the laws of trigonometry Hence we say,\nplain sailing, mercator’s, middle-latitude, parallel and great circle\nsailing See the article Navigation",

by firing cannon, or small arms; by artificial fire-\nworks; and by lanthorns Firing of great guns will serve equally in the day or night, or in a\n\n\nfog; to make or confirm signals; or to raise the attention of the hearers\nto a future order This method, however, is attended with some\ninconveniencies, and should not be used indiscriminately Too great a\nrepetition of the cannon is apt to introduce mistakes and confusion, as\nwell as to discover the tract of the squadron The report and flight of\nthe rockets is liable to the same objection, when at a short distance\nfrom the enemy It is then, by the combination of signals, previously known, that the\nadmiral conveys orders to his fleet; every squadron, every division, and\nevery ship of which has its particular signal The instruction may\ntherefore occasionally be given to the whole fleet, or to any of its\nsquadrons; to any division of those squadrons, or to any ship of those\ndivisions Hence the signal of command may at the same time be displayed\nfor three divisions, and for three ships of each division; or for three\nships in each squadron, and for only nine ships in the whole fleet For,\nthe general signal of the fleet being shewn, if a particular pendant be\nalso thrown out from some remarkable place on the same mast with\nthe general signal, it will communicate intelligence to nine ships that\nwear the same pendant The preparatory signal given by the admiral to the whole, or any\npart of his fleet, is immediately answered by those to whom it is\ndirected; by shewing the same signal, to testify that they are ready to\nput his orders in execution Having observed their answer, he will\nshew the signal which is to direct their operations: as,\nTo chace, to form the line, to begin the engagement, to board, to\ndouble upon the enemy, to rally or return to action, to discontinue the\nfight, to retreat and save themselves The dexterity of working the\nships in a fleet depends on the precise moment of executing these\norders; and on the general harmony of their movements: a\ncircumstance which evinces the utility of a signal of preparation As the extent of the line of battle, and the fire and smoke of the\naction, or other circumstances in navigation, will frequently prevent\nthe admiral’s signals from being seen throughout the fleet, they are\nalways repeated by the officers next in command; by ships appointed\nto repeat signals; and, finally, by the ship or ships for which they are\nintended The ships that repeat the signals, besides the chiefs of squadrons or\ndivisions, are usually frigates lying to windward or to leeward of the\nline They should be extremely vigilant to observe and repeat the\n\n\nsignals, whether they are to transmit the orders of the commander in\nchief, or his seconds, to any part of the fleet; or to report the fortunate\nor distressful situation of any part thereof By this means all the ships\nfrom the van to the rear will, unless disabled, be ready at a moment’s\nwarning to put the admiral’s designs in execution To preserve order in the repetition of signals, and to favour their\ncommunication, without embarassment, from the commander in chief,\nto the ship for which they are calculated, the commanders of the\nsquadrons repeat after the admiral; the chiefs of the divisions,\naccording to their order in the line, after the commanders of the\nsquadrons; and the particular ships after the chiefs of the divisions;\nand those, in return, after the particular ships, vice versa, when the\nobject is to convey any intelligence from the latter to the admiral Besides the signals above mentioned, there are others for different\nranks of officers; as for captains, lieutenants, masters, &c or for any of\nthose officers of a peculiar ship See Division and Squadron SKEET, a sort of long scoop commonly used to wet the decks and\nsides of a ship in hot weather, in order to keep them cool, and to\nprevent them from splitting by the heat of the sun This practice is\naccordingly performed in general every morning and evening before\nsun-rise and after sun-set This instrument, fig 8 plate IX",

by which it is occasionally shifted to either\nquarter See Vessel Sloop of War, a name given to the smallest vessels of war, except\ncutters They are either rigged as ships or as snows See Command,\nHorse, and Rate To SLUE, is to turn any cylindrical or conical piece of timber about\nits axis, without removing it This term is generally expressed of the\nmovement by which a mast or boom is turned about, in its cap or\nboom-iron SMACK, a small vessel commonly rigged as a sloop or hoy, used in\nthe coasting or fishing trade; or as a tender in the King’s service SNATCH-BLOCK, galoche, a block having an opening in one of its\nsides, wherein to fix the bight of rope occasionally See Block SNOTTER See the article Sprit SNOW, senau, is generally the largest of all two-masted vessels\nemployed by Europeans, and the most convenient for navigation The sails and rigging on the main-mast and fore-mast of a snow, are\nexactly similar to those on the same masts in a ship; only that there is\n\n\na small mast behind the main-mast of the former, which carries a sail\nnearly resembling the mizen of a ship The foot of this mast is fixed in\na block of wood on the quarter-deck abaft the main-mast; and the\nhead of it is attached to the afterpart of the main-top The sail, which\nis called the try-sail, is extended from its mast towards the stern of the\nvessel When the sloops of war are rigged as snows, they are furnished with\na horse, which answers the purpose of the trysail-mast, the fore part of\nthe sail being attached by rings to the said horse, in different parts of\nits height SOLE, a name sometimes given to the lower side of a gun-port,\nwhich however is more properly called the port-sell SOUNDING, (sonder, Fr ) the operation of trying the depth of the\nwater, and the quality of the ground, by means of a plummet, plomb\nde sonde, sunk from a ship to the bottom There are two plummets used for this purpose in navigation; one of\nwhich is called the hand-lead, weighing about 8 or 9 pound; and the\nother the deep-sea-lead, which weighs from 25 to 30 pound, and both\nare shaped like the frustrum of a cone or pyramid The former is used\nin shallow waters, and the latter at a great distance from the shore;\nparticularly on approaching the land, after a sea-voyage Accordingly\nthe lines employed for this purpose are called the deep-sea lead-line,\nand the hand lead-line The hand lead-line, which is usually 20 fathoms in length, is\nmarked at every 2 or 3 fathoms; so that the depth of the water may be\nascertained either in the day or night At the depth of 2 and 3\nfathoms, there are marks of black leather; at 5 fathom, there is a\nwhite rag; at 7, a red rag; at 10, black leather; at 13, black leather; at\n15, a white rag; and at 17, a red ditto Sounding with the hand-lead, which is called heaving the lead by\nseamen, is generally performed by a man who stands in the main-\nchains to windward Having the line all ready to run out, without\ninterrupton, he holds it nearly at the distance of a fathom from the\nplummet, and having swung the latter backwards and forwards three\nor four times, in order to acquire the greater velocity, he swings it\nround his head, and thence, as far forward as is necessary; so that, by\nthe lead’s sinking whilst the ship advances, the line may be almost\nperpendicular when it reaches the bottom The person sounding then\nproclaims the depth of the water in a kind of song resembling the\ncries of hawkers in a city Thus, if the mark of 5 fathoms is close to\n\n\nthe surface of the water, he calls ‘By the mark five ’ and as there is no\nmark at 4, 6, 8, &c he estimates those numbers, and calls, ‘By the dip\nfour,’ &c If he judges it to be a quarter, or an half more than any\nparticular number, he calls, ‘And a quarter five and a half four,’ &c If\nhe conceives the depth to be 3 quarters more than a particular\nnumber, he calls it a quarter less than the next: thus, at 4 fathom and\n¾, he calls ‘A quarter less five ’ and so on The deep-sea-lead is marked with two knots at 20 fathom, 3 at 30, 4\nat 40, and so on to the end It is also marked with a single knot in the\nmiddle of each interval, as at 25, 35, 45 fathoms, &c To use this lead\nmore effectually at sea, or in deep water on the sea-coast, it is usual\npreviously to bring-to the ship, in order to retard her course: the lead\nis then thrown as far as possible from the ship on the line of her drift,\nso that, as it sinks, the ship drives more perpendicularly over it The\npilot feeling the lead strike the bottom, readily discovers the depth of\nthe water by the mark on the line nearest its surface The bottom of\nthe lead being also well rubbed over with tallow, retains the\ndistinguishing marks of the bottom, as shells, ooze, gravel, &c which\nnaturally adheres to it The depth of the water, and the nature of the ground, which is\ncalled the soundings, are carefully marked in the log-book, as well to\ndetermine the distance of the place from the shore, as to correct the\nobservations of former pilots See Coasting and Navigation SPAN, pendour (spanna, Ital ) a small line or cord, the middle of\nwhich is usually attached to a stay, from whence the two ends branch\noutwards to the right and left, and having either a block or thimble\nattached to their extremities The intention of the span is accordingly\nto confine some rope which passes through the corresponding block or\nthimble, as well to increase the effort of the said rope, as to prevent it\nfrom swinging at too great a distance from the centre of its action in\nstormy weather Such are the spans occasionally used for the top-\ngallant braces, or the fore-top-gallant bowlines, &c Span-shackle See the article Davit SPARE, rechange, an epithet applied to any part of a ship’s equipage,\nor furniture, that lies in reserve, to supply the place of such as may be\nlost, or rendered incapable of service Hence we say, spare top-masts,\nspare sails, spare rigging, &c PUMP-SPEAR See the article Pump SPELL, the period wherein a sailor, or gang of sailors, is employed\nin a particular exercise, from which they are relieved as soon as the\n\n\nlimited time expires Such are the spells, to the hand-lead in sounding;\nto the pump; to look out on the mast-head, &c and to steer the ship;\nwhich last, however, is generally called the trick See Steering Spell also implies the relief, or the return of duty to those services:\nThus we say, spell the pump, spell the lead, &c To SPILL, to discharge the wind out of the cavity or belly of a sail\nwhen it is drawn up in the brails in order to furl or reef it This is\neither performed by collecting the sail together, or by bracing its edge\nto the wind, so as to shiver or be laid aback SPILLING-LINES, certain ropes fixed occasionally to the main-sail\nand fore-sail of a ship, in tempestuous weather, for reefing or furling\nthem more conveniently They are passed through blocks above the\nyard, and thence leading down before the sail, come under its bottom,\nand return upwards behind it to the yard, where they are fastened; so\nthat the sail, by their effort, is closely and immoveably confined to the\nyard SPINDLE, a sort of iron-pin tapering at the upper end to a point It\nis used to stick into the upper end of the top-gallant-mast, so as to\ncarry a vane, which, turning thereon horizontally, will show the\ndirection of the wind It is usually crowned with a globular or conical\npiece of wood called the acorn, which prevents the vane from being\nblown off See Acorn Spindle is also the lower end or foot of the capstern, which is shod\nwith iron, and becomes the pivot or axis upon which it turns in the\nsaucer See the article Capstern SPIRKETTING, that range of planks which lies between the water-\nways and the lower edge of the gun-ports within the side of a ship of\nwar To SPLICE, episser (splitser Dutch, plico Lat ) to join the two ends of a\nrope together, or to unite the end of a rope to any other part thereof There are several different methods of performing this operation,\naccording to the services on which it is to be employed Thus, there is\nthe short-splice, the long-splice, the eye-splice, and the cunt-splice; all\nof which are calculated for different purposes The short-splice is made by untwisting the ends of two ropes, or the\ntwo ends of one rope, and, having placed each of the strands of one\nopposite to and in the interval between two strands of the other, to\ndraw them close together; and then interweave the strands of one into\nthe alternate strands of the other, by penetrating the latter with a fid\nor marline-spike, parallel to the axis or length of the rope This splice\n\n\nis used on the cables, slings, block-strops, and in general all ropes\nwhich are not intended to run through blocks, or where the splice is\nnot in danger of being loosened or separated The long-splice being fixed in three places, occupies a greater extent\nof the rope; but by the division of the joinings, the bulk is also divided\ninto different parts of its length Hence it is much neater and\nsmoother than the short-splice, and better adapted to run through the\nchannel of a block, &c for which use it is generally calculated The eye-splice being intended to make a sort of eye or circle at the\nend of a rope, the strands are untwisted, and their extremities thrust\nthrough the three strands in that part of the said rope, whereon the\nsplice is to be formed, and thence passing over the surface of the\nsecond strand, they are again thrust through the third, which\ncompleats the operation The cunt-splice is constructed in the same manner as the eye-splice,\nbeing no other than the ends of two lines fastened together at a short\ndistance from each other, the extremities of either being interwoven\ninto the bight of the other, so that the line becomes double in the\nextent of the splice This is chiefly used in lead-lines, log-lines, and\nfishing-lines, where the short-splice would be liable to separation, as\nbeing frequently loosened by the water SPLIT, the state of a sail which is rent asunder by the violence of a\ntempest, or by sustaining a greater effort on one part of its surface\nthan the rest Split, when applied to a ship, is also the state of being stranded\nand bilged on a rock or shore SPOON-DRIFT, a sort of showery sprinkling of the sea-water, swept\nfrom the surface of the waves in a tempest, and flying according to\nthe direction of the wind like a vapour SPOONING By the explanation of this term in our dictionaries, it\nseems formerly to have signified that movement, in navigation, which\nis now called scudding Be that as it may, there is at present no such\nphrase in our sea-language SPRAY, the sprinkling of the sea, which is driven from the top of a\nwave in stormy weather It differs from spoon-drift, as being only\nblown occasionally from the broken surface of a high wave, whereas\nthe latter continues to fly horizontally along the sea, without\nintermission, during the excess of a tempest or hurricane SPRING, a crack or breach running transversely or obliquely\nthrough any part of a mast or yard, so as to render it unsafe to carry\n\n\nthe usual quantity of sail thereon Spring is also a rope passed out of one extremity of a ship and\nattached to a cable proceeding from the other, when she lies at\nanchor It is usually performed to bring the ship’s broad-side, or\nbattery of cannon, to bear upon some distant object; as another ship,\nor a fortress on the coast, &c When a ship rides by anchors which are\nonly carried out of one end, she will swing upon the surface of the\nwater like a weather-cock, according to the direction of the wind;\nunless when the wind is opposed by a current Now, if instead of\nbeing fastened at one end, she is attached by ropes, which, proceeding\nfrom her head and stern towards the same source, sustain an equal\neffort of the wind, it is evident that her side will be presented to the\nwind; and that, by slackening one of those ropes, and keeping fast the\nother, her side will lie more or less obliquely to the wind, so as to be\nopposed to any distant object to the right or left Thus, if a ship rides with her head northerly, and it is required to\ncannonade a fortress lying on the south or south-east: a hauser is run\nout of the stern, and being carried forward, without her side, is\nattached to the cable, at a competent distance ahead of the ship: the\nhauser is then tightened by the capstern or tackles, and the cable being\nslackened, the ship immediately turns her side towards the object\nintended to be battered Spring is likewise a rope reaching diagonally from the stern of a\nship to the head of another which lies along-side or a-breast of her, at\na short distance This is generally performed to make one of the ships\nsheer off, to a greater distance from the other; or to make merchant-\nships lie uniformly in the same tier Springs of this sort are therefore\noccasionally applied from a ship, to a wharf or key, for the same\npurposes To Spring a leak See the article Leak Springing the Luff See Luff",

and hence\nSteerage-way, is that degree of progressive motion communicated\nto a ship, by which she becomes susceptible of the effects of the helm\nto govern her course See Helm and Sailing STEERING, gouverner (steoran, Sax ) may be defined the art of\ndirecting the ship’s way by the movements of the helm; or of applying\nits efforts to regulate her course when she advances The perfection of steering consists in a vigilant attention to the\nmotion of the ship’s head, so as to check every deviation from the line\nof her course in the first instant of its motion; and in applying as little\nof the power of the helm as possible By this she will run more\nuniformly in a streight path, as declining less to the right and left:\nwhereas, if a greater effort of the helm is employed, it will produce a\ngreater declination from the course, and not only increase the\ndifficulty of steering, but also make a crooked and irregular tract\nthrough the water See Helm The helmsman should diligently watch the movements of the head\nby the land, clouds, moon, or stars; because although the course is in\ngeneral regulated by the compass, yet the vibrations of the needle are\nnot so quickly perceived, as the sallies of the ship’s head to the right\nor left, which, if not immediately restrained, will acquire additional\nvelocity in every instant of their motion, and demand a more\npowerful impulse of the helm to reduce them; the application of\nwhich, will operate to turn her head as far on the contrary side of her\ncourse The phrases used in steering a ship vary according to the relation of\nthe wind to her course Thus, if the wind is fair, or large, the phrases\nused by the pilot, or officer, who superintends the steerage, are port,\nstarboard, and steddy The first is intended to direct the ship’s course\nfarther to the right; the second is to guide her farther to the left; and\nthe last, as explained under that word, is designed to keep her exactly\nin the line, whereon she advances, according to the course prescribed The excess of the first and second movement is called hard-a-port, and\nhard-a-starboard; the former of which gives her the greatest possible\ninclination to the right, and the latter an equal tendency to the left If, on the contrary, the wind is foul or scant, the phrases are luff,\nthus, and no nearer; the first of which is the order to keep her close to\nthe wind; the second, to retain her in her present situation; and the\nthird, to keep her sails full The effects of these movements are farther\nexplained under the several terms; but more particularly under the\n\n\narticle Full and By In a ship of war, the exercise of steering the ship is usually divided\namongst a number of the most expert sailors, who attend the helm in\ntheir turns;

as from scud,\nstead, or steddy The small sails used by sloops, schooners, and\ntartanes, when scudding, are nearly of the same size and figure with\nthe lower studding-sails; and the accidental application of the former,\nto the usual design of the latter, throws a probability on the\nderivation from scud; especially as being used in the small vessels of\nour ancestors, who were unacquainted with topmasts; and, of course,\nhad no conception of topmast-studding-sails An ingenious friend of\nthe author, seems, with greater propriety, to derive it from steddy;\nbecause, when the wind is extremely feeble, the fluctuation of the sea,\nalthough almost imperceptible, is communicated to the ship, and\nthence to the principal sails; which, being shaken and slapped against\nthe masts, will, by their weight, prevent, or at least considerably\ndiminish, the operation of the wind The studding-sails, on the\ncontrary, being of a much lighter and thinner texture, more readily\nfeel the effort of the breeze, and continue inflated, so as to push the\n\n\nship forward, and give her head-way By this circumstance, she\nbecomes susceptible of the power of the helm, and is accordingly\nretained in a steddy course; and hence those sails may originally have\nbeen called steddying-sails, afterwards corrupted into studding-sails The last conjecture, which seems equally favourable, is drawn from\nthe Saxon word sted, to help or assist; in which sense, those sails may\nbe considered as auxiliar, being set occasionally to help the others, or\nassist the ship’s course; and thence called steading, or stedding-sails But the expression of steering sails, however adopted by many officers,\nis a most contemptible conceit, without either authority or reason to\nsupport it The others are implicitly submitted to the reader’s decision The topmast studding-sails, or those which are set on the out side of\nthe topsails, are spread below by a boom, which, sliding out from the\nextremities of the main and fore-yards, as explained in the article\nSaddle, pushes out their lower corners: and their upper edges, which\nare attached to a light pole, are hoisted up to the topsail-yard-arms See also Boom-iron, in the article Iron-work The lower studding-sails, which are spread beyond the skirts or\nleech of the main-sail and fore-sail, are fixed nearly in the same\nmanner; only that the boom, which extends their bottoms, is generally\nhooked to the chains by means of a goose-neck; or else swings off along\nwith the sail, to which it is suspended; being kept steddy behind by a\nrope called the guy STUFF, courrée, any composition, or melted mass, used to smear or\ndaub the masts, sides, or bottom of a ship That which is chiefly used\nfor the lower masts is simply turpentine, rosin, or varnish of pine: for\nthe topmasts, tallow or butter: for the sides, turpentine, varnish of\npine, tar and oil, or tar mixed with oil and red oker: and for the\nbottom, a mixture of tallow, sulphur, and rosin, or tar: whale-oil and\nbroken glass;

    "A ship is said to be on the starboard or larboard tack, when she is\nclose-hauled, with the wind upon the starboard or larboard side; and in\nthis sense the distance which she sails in that position is considered as\nthe length of the tack; although this is more frequently called a\nBoard See that article See that article To Tack, virer vent devant, to change the course from one board to\nanother, or turn the ship about from the starboard to the larboard\ntack, in a contrary wind Thus the ship A, fig 2 plate XI being close-\nhauled on the larboard tack, and turning her prow suddenly to\nwindward, receives the impression of the wind on her head-sails a, by\nwhich she falls off upon the line of the starboard tack a Tacking is\nalso used, in a more enlarged sense, to imply that manœuvre, in\nnavigation, by which a ship makes an oblique progression to the\nwindward, in a zigzag direction This, however, is more usually called\nbeating or turning to windward See Beating and Turning Thus, suppose a ship A, fig 2 plate XI plate XI bound to a port B lying to\nwindward, with the wind northerly, as expressed by the arrow The\nsails a, b, c, being braced obliquely with the keel, the wind also falls\nupon their surfaces in an oblique direction, by which the ship is\npushed to leeward, as explained in the article Lee-way Hence,\nalthough she apparently sails W N W upon the larboard tack, as\n\n\nexpressed in the dotted line A d, and E N E upon the other d f, yet if\nthe lee-way is only one point, (and indeed it is seldom less in the\nsmoothest water), the course will accordingly be W by N upon one\ntack, and E by N upon the other, as represented by the lines A e, and\ne g If the port A were directly to windward of the ship, it is evident that\nboth tacks ought to be of equal length; or, in other words, that she\nought to run the same distance upon each tack: but as the place of her\ndestination lies obliquely to windward, she must run a greater\ndistance upon one tack than the other; because the extremities of both\nboards should be equally distant from the line of her true course B A;\nso the larboard tack A e, crossing the course more obliquely than the\nother e g, will necessarily be much longer As the true course, or the direct distance from B to A, is only 12\nleagues, it is evident, that with a favourable wind she could reach it in\na few hours On the contrary, her distance is considerably increased\nby the length of her boards, in a contrary wind; which, by its\nobliquity with her sails, operates also to retard her velocity Thus her\nfirst board A e, on a W by N course, is equal to 5 7 leagues The\nsecond tack e g is 9 2 leagues E by N : the third tack, parallel to A e, is\n11 5: the fourth, parallel to e g, is 9 2: and the fifth, parallel to the\nfirst, 11 7 leagues Finally, the sixth board is 4 8 leagues, parallel to\nthe second, which brings her to the port B By this scheme it appears\nthat she has run more than four times the extent of the line A B, her\nprimitive distance; and this in the most favourable circumstances of a\ncontrary wind, viz when the sea is smooth, and when she may carry\nher full topsails For if the wind blows stronger, to render it necessary\nto reef the topsails, she will soon make two points of lee-way, and\naccordingly run east on one board, and west on the other In this\nsituation she will neither approach, nor recede from the place of her\ndestination: but if the wind increases, the sea will also be enlarged; a\ncircumstance that still farther augments the lee-way Hence the vessel\nwill gradually fall off from the port, in proportion to the augmentation\nof the wind and sea, which occasions a proportional increase of lee-\nway In order to explain the theory of tacking a ship, it may be necessary\nto premise a known axiom in natural philosophy, That every body will\npersevere in a state of rest, or of moving uniformly in a right line,\nunless it be compelled to change its state by forces impressed; and\nthat the change of motion is proportional to the moving force\n\n\nimpressed, and is made according to the right line in which that force\nis exerted By this principle it is easy to conceive how a ship is compelled to\nturn into any direction, by the force of the wind acting upon her sails,\nin horizontal lines For the sails may be so arranged as to receive the\ncurrent of air, either directly, or more or less obliquely: hence the\nmotion communicated to the sails must of necessity conspire with that\nof the wind upon their surfaces To make the ship tack, or turn round\nwith her head to the windward, it is therefore necessary, after she has\nreceived the first impression from the helm, that the head-sails should\nbe so disposed as to diminish the effort of the wind, in the first instant\nof her motion, and that the whole force of the wind should be exerted\non the after-sails, which operating on the ship’s stern, carries it round\nlike a weather-cock But since the action of the after-sails, to turn the\nship, will unavoidably cease when her head points to the windward, it\nthen becomes necessary to use the head-sails, to prevent her from\nfalling-off, and returning to her former situation These are\naccordingly laid aback on the lee-side, to push the vessel’s fore-part\ntowards the opposite side, till she has fallen into the line of her course\nthereon, and fixed her sails to conform with that situation It has been observed above, that the first effort to turn the ship in\ntacking is communicated by the helm, which is then put to the lee-\nside This circumstance being announced by the pilot, or\ncommanding-officer, who then calls out, Helm’s a-lee the head-sails\nare immediately made to shiver in the wind, by casting loose their\nsheets, or bowlines The pilot then calls, Up tacks and sheets which is\nexecuted by loosening all the ropes which confine the corners of the\nlower sails, in order that they may be more readily shifted to the other\nside When the ship has turned her head directly to windward, as in d,\nfig",

    "in order to proportion the weight\nto the resistance, the power applied must be to the weight, as one, to\ntwice the number of sheaves in the moveable blocks: because, in the\n\n\nefforts of a tackle, the velocity of the moving power is, to the velocity\nof the rising or moving body, as twice the number of moveable\nsheaves to unity, as appears in fig 5 which consists of one fixed block\na, and another moveable as e For since one rope operates on all the\nsheaves from g to f, the part at f, lying beyond the fixed block, and\ncalled the fall, cannot be drawn down and lengthened, unless the two\nparts d and c, on each side of the moveable block, be at the same time\nequally drawn up and shortened Hence it is evident, that the part a f\nwill be lengthened twice as much as either d or c is shortened,\nbecause whatever is taken from each of those parts is added to the\nlength of a f; but the point f, to which the power is applied, descends\nas fast as a f is lengthened and the point e, to which the weight is\nfastened, ascends as fast as d or c is shortened If therefore, a weight\nsuspended at f, be to a weight suspended at e, as one to two, they will\nbalance each other, as being in the reciprocal ratio of their velocities Whatever has been observed with regard to the tackles above\nmentioned, is equally applicable to all others, and is in the same\nmanner demonstrable, viz that the velocity with which the\nmechanical force moves, in raising a weight, is to the velocity\nwherewith the weight rises, as twice the number of moveable sheaves\nto unity A tackle wherein both the blocks are moveable, and communicate\nwith a runner, is represented by fig 10 plate VIII That part of the\ntackle which is fixed to one of the blocks, &c is called the standing\npart; all the rest are called running parts; and that whereon the men\npull when employing the tackle, is called the fall The application of\nthe tackle to mechanical purposes is termed hoisting or bowssing See\nthose articles Ground Tackle See Ground Tackle Tack-tackle, a small tackle used occasionally to pull down the\ntack of the principal sails of a ship to their respective stations There\nis also a tackle of this kind constantly fixed to the tacks of the main-\nsail in brigs, sloops, and schooners, for the same purpose See the\nFrench term Palan, and the phrases annexed thereto TAFFAREL, couronnement, the upper part of a ship’s stern, being a\ncurved piece of wood, expressed by F F, in fig 1 plate X and usually\nornamented with sculpture TAIL, a name given by sailors to the extremities of a hurricane,\nwherein the violence is considerably exhausted Tail-block, a small single block, having a short piece of rope\n\n\nattached to it, by which it may be fastened to any object at pleasure;\neither for convenience, or to increase the force applied to the said\nobject, as explained in the first part of the article Tackle TAKING-IN, the act of brailing-up and furling the sails at sea,\nparticularly when the wind increases It is generally used in\nopposition to setting See also Furl and Shorten TALLYING, border, a phrase used by the common sailors, implying\nthe act of pulling aft the sheets, or lower corners of the main-sail and\nfore-sail TAR, a sort of liquid gum, of a blackish hue, which distils from\npines or fir-trees, either naturally or by incision; and being prepared\nby boiling, is used to pay the sides of ships and boats, and their\nrigging, in order to preserve them from the effects of the weather, by\nwhich they would otherwise soon become cracked, split, or rotten Tar is also a figurative expression for a sailor of any kind Tar-pawling, prélart, a broad piece of canvas well daubed with tar,\nand used to cover the hatchways of a ship at sea, to prevent the\npenetration of the rain, or sea-water, which may occasionally rush\nover the decks See Battens",

and to ascertain the distance of each course This implement is\nparticularly useful in light and variable winds, at which time the\n\n\nhelmsman marks the course every half hour, by fixing a peg in that\npoint of the compass whereon the ship had advanced Thus, if the\nwind is northerly at the beginning of the watch, the ship, being close-\nhauled on the larboard tack, will steer W N W If, after the first half\nhour, the wind changes to N by W the ship will fall off to W by N both of these courses are marked by the helmsman upon the traverse-\nboard, by putting in one peg for every half hour on which she steers\nthe same course; as, one peg into W N W and two pegs into W by N if she sails an hour on the latter course; and so on The lee-way and\nvariation of the compass are afterwards allowed by the pilot, on\nsumming up the whole TREE-NAILS, gournables, certain long cylindrical wooden pins,\nemployed to connect the planks of a ship’s side and bottom to the\ncorresponding timbers The tree-nails are justly esteemed superior to spike-nails or bolts,\nwhich are liable to rust, and loosen, as well as to rot the timber; but it\nis necessary that the oak of which they are formed should be solid,\nclose, and replete with gum, to prevent them from breaking and\nrotting in the ship’s frame They ought also to be well dried, so as to\nfill their holes when they are swelled with moisture They have\nusually one inch in thickness to 100 feet in the vessel’s length; so that\nthe tree-nails of a ship of 100 feet long, are one inch in diameter; and\none inch and a half for a ship of 150 feet TRESTLE-TREES, tesseaux, two strong bars of timber fixed\nhorizontally on the opposite sides of the lower mast-head, to support\nthe frame of the top, and the weight of the top-mast See Mast and\nTop TRIM, manege du navire, (trimman, Sax to build) implies, in general,\nthe state or disposition by which a ship is best calculated for the\nseveral purposes of navigation Thus the trim of the hold denotes the most convenient and proper\narrangement of the various materials contained therein, relatively to\nthe ships motion or stability at sea The trim of the masts and sails is\nalso their most apposite situation, with regard to the construction of\nthe ship, and the effort of the wind upon her sails As the stowage of the hold, or the disposition of the several articles\nof the cargo, considerably affects the ship’s motion and stability, it\nwill be necessary to give a general idea of the action of a heavy body\nupon the fluid that supports it, and the re-action of the fluid on the\nfloating body The whole weight of any body, then, may be considered as united\nin its center of gravity; so that, if it were suspended by a line fastened\nto this center, the line would hang in a perpendicular position, as\ndirected through the center of gravity to the center of the earth A\nbody which floats in a fluid is not, however, supported by its center of\ngravity, but by the compression of the surrounding filaments of water:\nand each of these, being considered as infinitely small, will act upon a\nvery minute portion of the surface of the floating body, with regard to\nthe specific gravity, and conform to a principle applicable to all fluids,\nin proportion to the height of these filaments, viz That the weight of\na column of any fluid will be in proportion to the specific gravity of\nthe fluid and the height of the column multiplied by its base But as heavy bodies endeavour, by their gravity, to approach the\ncenter of the earth, in a vertical line passing through their centers; so\nthe pressure of fluids endeavours to carry bodies in a vertical, tending\nfrom the center of the earth towards their surface, and passing\nthrough the center of gravity of the submerged part, which forces\nthem towards the surface So, in any submerged body at rest, these\ntwo opposite forces coincide in the same vertical, acting in a direction\nquite contrary to each other Bouguer’s Traité du navire From this theory it results, that the stability or trim of a ship chiefly\ndepends upon her construction, as considering the bottom to be\nhomogeneous This, however, can only happen when her cargo\nconsists of the same materials throughout, as with corn, salt, or any\nspecies stowed in bulk, and when her hold is entirely filled For if the\nship has not sufficient breadth to resist the effort of the wind upon her\nsails; or if she is built too high, or too sharp in the floor, her center of\ngravity will be too high, and she will be very crank, i e apt to\noverturn But as the stiffness of a ship, or quality to carry sail without danger\nof overturning, depends very much on the stowage of the hold, the\ncenter of gravity may thereby be considerably lowered, by which her\nstability will be increased in proportion It is a general maxim\namongst mariners, that a ship will not carry sufficient sail till she is\nladen so deep that the surface of the water may glance on her extreme\nbreadth amidships She must therefore have a great deal of weight, as\nballast, &c to bring her to this situation, which is called a good\nsailing trim Several circumstances are also to be particularly considered with\nregard to the quality, weight, and stowage of the ballast The center of\n\n\ngravity being placed too high, will render the ship incapable of\ncarrying a sufficient quantity of sail; and by having it too low, she will\nbe in danger of rolling away her masts When it is placed too far\nforward, the ship will pitch, and labour heavily; and when too far aft,\nshe will occasionally be exposed to the dangerous circumstance of a\npooping sea These extremes being carefully avoided, it remains to\nproportion the contents of every part of the hold to its capacity, and to\nplace the lightest materials uppermost See Stowage Trim, when applied to the sails, denotes the general arrangement\nwhich is best calculated to accelerate the ship’s course, according to\nthe direction of the wind See the article Sailing If the ship were always to sail before the wind, it would be a very\nsimple operation to trim the sails; because nothing else could be\nrequired than to dispose them so as to receive the greatest possible\neffort of the wind, which is evidently performed by arranging them at\nright angles with its direction But, when the current of wind acts\nmore directly upon the ship’s side, it necessarily falls more obliquely\non the surface of the sails, so as to diminish their effort to push the\nship forward; and to augment their tendency to make her incline to\none side Hence we may conclude, that an increase of the wind, when\naccompanied with a variation unfavourable to the ship’s course, will\nby no means augment her velocity; because the force previously\nemployed to push her forward, will afterwards operate to overturn\nher; and because this impression renders it necessary to reduce the\nquantity of sail; the effort of which is farther diminished by the\nobliquity of the action of the wind upon its surface By this theory it appears, that the effect of the wind to advance the\nship decreases in proportion to its obliquity with any sail upon which\nit operates The mechanical disposition of the sails, according to every direction\nof the wind upon their surfaces, is copiously described in the articles\nClose-hauled, Large, Sailing, and Tacking Trim, when expressed of the masts, denotes their position with\nregard to the ship and to each other Thus, in the latter sense, they\nshould neither be too near nor too far apart; and, in the former, they\nshould not be too far forward or aft; and, according to the situation or\nquality which communicates a greater velocity to the vessel, they\nshould either be upright, or inclining aft, or forward Trim the boat See Boat, and the phrases succeeding it Sharp-Trimmed, the situation of a ship’s sails in a scant wind TRIMONEER, a barbarous corruption of Timoneer See that article TRIP, a cant phrase, implying an outward-bound voyage,\nparticularly in the coasting navigation It also denotes a single board\nin plying to windward TRIPPING, the movement by which an anchor is loosened from the\nbottom by its cable or buoy-ropes See Atrip TROUGH, a name given to the hollow, or interval between two high\nwaves, which resembles a broad and deep trench perpetually\nfluctuating As the setting of the sea is always produced by the wind, it\nis evident that the waves, and consequently the trough or hollow\nspace between them, will be at right angles with the direction of the\nwind Hence a ship rolls heaviest when she lies in the trough of the\nsea TROWSERS, a sort of loose breeches of canvas worn by common\nsailors TRUCK, a piece of wood, which is either conical, cylindrical,\nspherical, or spheroidical Thus the trucks fixed on the spindle of a mast-head, and which are\notherwise called acorns, are in the form of a cone: and those which are\nemployed as wheels to the gun-carriages are cylinders The trucks of\nthe parrels assume the figure of a globe; and, lastly, those of the flag-\nstaffs resemble an oblate spheroid See the articles Acorn, Cannon,\nParrel, and Flag-staff Trucks of the shrouds are nearly similar to those of the parrels: they\nare fastened to the shrouds about twelve or fourteen feet above the\ndeck, the hole in the middle being placed perpendicularly to contain\nsome rope which passes through it The intention of these is to guide\nthe sailors to the particular rope, which might otherwise be easily\nmistaken for some other of the same size, especially in the night Speaking-TRUMPET, trompette marine, a trumpet of brass or tin used\nat sea, to propagate the voice to a great distance, or to convey the\norders from one part of the ship to another, in tempestuous weather,\n&c when they cannot otherwise be distinctly heard by the persons to\nwhom they are directed Fire-TRUNK See the article Fire-ship TRUNNIONS, tourillons, the two knobs or arms which project from\nthe opposite sides of a piece of artillery, and serve to support it in the\ncarriage See Cannon and Mortar TRUSS, (trousse, Fr ) a machine employed to pull a yard home to its\nrespective mast, and retain it firmly in that position As the truss is generally used instead of a parrel, it is rarely\nemployed, except in flying top-gallant-sails, which are never furnished\nwith parrels It is no other than a ring or traveller, which encircles the\nmast, and has a rope fastened to its after-part, leading downward to\nthe top or decks; by means of which the truss may be straitened or\nslackened at pleasure The haliards of the top-gallant-sail being passed\nthrough this ring; and the sail being hoisted up to its utmost extent; it\nis evident, that the yard will be drawn close to the mast, by pulling\ndown the truss close to the upper part of the sail For, without the\ntruss, the sail and its yard would be blown from the mast, so as to\nswing about, by the action of the wind, and the rocking of the vessel;\nunless the yard were hoisted close up to the pulley wherein the\nhaliards run; which seldom is the case in flying top-gallant-sails,\nbecause they are usually much shallower than those which are fixed\nor standing Truss-parrel See Parrel TRYING, à la cape, the situation in which a ship lies nearly in the\ntrough or hollow of the sea in a tempest, particularly when it blows\ncontrary to her course In trying, as well as in scudding, the sails are always reduced in\nproportion to the increase of the storm Thus, in the former state, a\nship may lie by the wind under a whole main-sail, a whole fore-sail,\nor a whole mizen; or under any of those sails, when diminished by the\nreef or balance As the least possible quantity of sail used in scudding\nare the goose-wings of the foresail; so in trying, the smallest portion is\ngenerally the mizen-staysail or main-staysail: and in either state, if the\nstorm is excessive, she may lie with all the sails furled, or, according\nto the sea-phrase, under bare poles The intent of spreading a sail at this time is to keep the ship more\n\n\nsteddy, and, by pressing her side down in the water, to prevent her\nfrom rolling violently; and also to turn her bow towards the direction\nof the wind, so that the shock of the waves may fall more obliquely on\nher flank, than when she lies along the trough of the sea While she\nremains in this situation, the helm is fastened close to the lee-side, or,\nin the sea-language, hard a-lee, to prevent her as much as possible\nfrom falling-off But as the ship is not then kept in equilibrio by the\neffort of her sails, which at other times counterbalance each other at\nthe head and stern, she is moved by a slow but continual vibration,\nwhich turns her head alternately to windward and to leeward,\nforming an angle of three or four points in the interval That part\nwhere she stops, in approaching the direction of the wind, is called\nher coming-to, and the contrary excess of the angle to leeward is\ntermed her falling-off Thus, suppose the wind northerly, and a ship trying with her\nstarboard side to windward: if, in turning her head towards the source\nof the wind, she arrives at N W ½ N or N 39° W and then declines\nto the leeward as far W ½ S or S 84° W, the former will be called\nher coming-to, and the latter her falling-off In this position she\nadvances very little according to the line of her length, but is driven\nconsiderably to leeward, as described in the articles Drift and Lee-\nway TUCK, a name given to that part of the ship where the ends of the\nbottom-planks are collected together immediately under the stern or\ncounter When this part, instead of being incurvated, and forming a convex\nsurface, assumes the shape of a vertical or oblique plane, it is said to\nbe square, as represented in fig",

or the end of it is simply fastened to the said\nyard or gaff, after communicating with the block at the mast-head See also the article Jears V VAN, avante-garde, the foremost division of any naval armament, or\nthat part which usually leads the way to battle;

and drawn in\nto windward when it becomes unfavourable to the ship’s course VARIATION, the angle contained between the true meridian and\nthe magnetic meridian ‘After the discovery of that most useful property of the magnet, or\nloadstone, namely, the giving hardened iron and steel a polarity, the\ncompass was for many years used without knowing that its direction\nin any wise deviated from the poles of the world: and about the\nmiddle of the 16th century, so certain were some of its inflexibly\npointing to the north, that they treated with contempt the notion of\nthe variation, which about that time began to be suspected[55] However, careful observations soon discovered, that in England, and\nits neighbourhood, the needle pointed to the eastward of the true\nnorth: but the quantity of this deviation being known, mariners\nbecame as well satisfied as if the compass had none; because they\nimagined that the true course could be obtained by making allowance\nfor the true variation ‘From successive observations made afterwards, it was found, that\nthe deviation of the needle from the north was not a constant\n\n\nquantity; but that it gradually diminished, and at last, about the year\n1660, it was found at London that the needle pointed due north, and\nhas ever since been getting to the westward, and now the variation is\nmore than 20 degrees to the westward of the north: so that in any one\nplace it may be suspected the variation has a kind of libratory motion,\ntraversing through the north to unknown limits eastward and\nwestward But the settling of this point must be left to time ‘During the time of the said observations it was also discovered,\nthat the variation of the needle was different in different parts of the\nworld, it being west in some places when it was east in others; and in\nplaces where the variation was of the same name, yet the quantity of\nit greatly differed It was therefore found necessary, that mariners\nshould every day, or as often as they had opportunity, make, during\ntheir voyage, proper observations for an amplitude or azimuth;\nwhereby they might be enabled to find the variation of the compass in\ntheir present place, and thence correct their courses ’ Robertson’s\nElements of navigation Dr",
    "Dr Halley published, in the last century, a theory of the variations\nof the compass In this work he supposes there are four magnetic\npoles in the earth, two of which are fixed and two moveable, by\nwhich he explains the different variation of the compass, at different\ntimes, in the same place But it is impossible to apply exact\ncalculations to so complicated an hypothesis But it is impossible to apply exact\ncalculations to so complicated an hypothesis M Euler, son of the\ncelebrated geometrician of that name, has however shewn, that two\nmagnetic poles placed on the surface of the earth will sufficiently\naccount for the singular figure assumed by the lines which pass\nthrough all the points of equal variation in the chart of Dr Halley M M Euler first examines the case, wherein the two magnetic poles\nare diametrically opposite; 2d he places them in the two opposite\nmeridians, but at unequal distances from the poles of the world; 3d he places them in the same meridian Finally, he considers them\nsituated in two different meridians These four cases may become\nequally important; because, if it is determined that there are only two\nmagnetic poles, and that these poles change their situations, it may\nsome time hereafter be discovered that they pass through all the\ndifferent positions Since the needle of the compass ought always to be in the plane\nwhich passes through the place of observation and the two magnetic\npoles, the problem is reduced to the discovery of the angle contained\nbetween this plane and the plane of the meridian",
    "Since the needle of the compass ought always to be in the plane\nwhich passes through the place of observation and the two magnetic\npoles, the problem is reduced to the discovery of the angle contained\nbetween this plane and the plane of the meridian M Euler, after\n\n\nhaving examined the different cases, finds, that they also express the\nearth’s magnetism, represented in the chart published by Mess Mountaine and Dodson in 1744, particularly throughout Europe and\nNorth America, if the following principles are established Between the Arctic pole and the magnetic pole 14° 53´ Between the Antarctic pole and the other magnetic pole 29° 23´ 53° 18´ The angle at the north pole, formed by the meridians\npassing through the two magnetic poles 250° The longitude of the meridian, which passes over the northern\nmagnetic pole As the observations which have been collected with regard to the\nvariation are, for the most part, loose and inaccurate, it is impossible\nto represent them all with precision; and the great variations observed\nin the Indian ocean, seem to require, says M Euler, that the three first\nquantities should be 14, 35, and 63 degrees In the mean time, the\ngeneral agreement is sufficiently satisfactory The high reputation of Dr Halley’s magnetical chart renders it more\nparticularly necessary to point out the errors contained therein[56] There is evidently too little distance between the lines of no variation,\nof which one crosses the equator 17° westward of London, and the\nother 119° to the eastward This makes 136 degrees only; whereas it\nshould necessarily exceed 180 and even 200, inasmuch as the pole of\nthe world is supposed farther distant from the magnetic pole towards\nthe south than in the north, as is required by the other phænomena Again, upon the coasts discovered by Diemen, there was no variation\nin 1642; and Dr Halley also supposes there was none in 1700 Meanwhile, by the alteration observed at Paris, the line of no\nvariation should be advanced 60° towards the south, which will agree\nbetter with the calculations, and prove that the distance of the two\nintersections was really greater than Dr Halley had established The table of variation of Mess Mountaine and Dodson is\naccompanied with several interesting particulars, which equally\ndeserve to be inserted here At Barbadoes, (says Capt Snow) the variation seems very nearly at\na stand; for in the road I observed 5° east; and by Dr Halley’s draught,\nin the year 1701, 5½ degrees In 1747, at Port Royal keys, Jamaica, I\nobserved the variation 7° 20´ E ; and on the coast of Carthagena, the\nsame week, off the high land of Santa Martha, 7° 45´ nearly south of\nPort Royal Therefore these curves are not much altered: the curve at\nJamaica is nearly at a stand, as though tied, and the south part of\n\n\nthem with the rest dropping to the westward Under the equator, in longitude 40° E from London, the highest\nvariation during the whole fifty-six years appears to be 17°¼ W and\nthe least 16°½ W : and in latitude 15° N longitude 60° W from\nLondon, the variation has been constantly 5° E : but in other places\nthe case has been widely different For in the latitude of 10° S longitude 60° E from London, the variation has decreased from 17°\nW to 7°¼ W ; and in latitude 10° S longitude 5° W from London,\nfrom 2°¼ W to 12°¾ W ; and in latitude 15° N longitude 20°, it has\nincreased from 1° W to 9° W But there is still a more extraordinary appearance in the Indian\nseas For instance, under the equator:\nLONGITUDE\nMAGNETICAL\nVARIATION\nEast from\nLondon in 1700 in 1756 Degrees Degrees Degrees 40\n16¾\nWest 16¼\nWest 45\n17¾\nW 14½\nW 50\n17½\nW 11¾\nW 55\n16½\nW 8¾\nW 60\n15¼\nW 6 \nW 65\n13½\nW 4½\nW 70\n11½\nW 3¼\nW 75\n9¾\nW 1 \nW 80\n7¾\nW 0¼\nEast 85\n5½\nW 1¼\nE 90\n4¼\nW 1 \nE 95\n3¼\nW 0½\nWest 100\n2½\nW 1 \nW Where the west variation, in the longitude 40° E is the same in\nboth the above years; and in 1700 the west variation seemed to be\nregularly decreasing from longitude 50° E to the longitude 100° E ;\nbut in 1756, we find the west variation decreasing so fast, that we\nhave east variation in the longitude 80°, 85°, and 90° E ; and yet in the\n\n\nlongitude 95° and 100° E we have west variation again Philosophical\nTransactions for the year 1757 To these remarks may be subjoined the following extracts from the\nExposition du calcul astronomique, by M de la Lande At the royal observatory in Paris, a magnetical needle of four inches\ndeviated from the N 18° 10´ towards the west, on the 15th of\nFebruary 1759: and on the 22d of April 1760, the same needle varied\n18° 20´ It is indeed natural to conceive, that nothing can be precisely\nascertained by ten minutes upon a circle whose diameter is only four\ninches It is nevertheless sufficiently evident, that this variation\ncontinues to increase at Paris In 1610 the needle declined 8° towards\nthe east, so that the variation has changed 26° 20´ in the space of 150\nyears; and this appears particularly since 1740: for the same needle,\nwhich has always been used by M Maraldi, is more than 3° advanced\ntowards the west, beyond what it was at that period; and this makes 9\n´ in one year To VEER and haul, to pull a rope tight, by drawing it in and\nslackening it alternately, till the body to which it is applied acquires\nan additional motion, like the increased vibrations of a pendulum, so\nthat the rope is straitened to a greater tension with more facility and\ndispatch This method is particularly used in hauling the bowlines The wind is said to veer and haul when it alters its direction, and\nbecomes more or less fair Thus it is said to veer aft and to haul\nforward To Veer away the cable See Cable VEERING, virer vent arriere, the operation by which a ship, in\nchanging her course from one board to the other, turns her stern to\nwindward Hence it is used in opposition to tacking, wherein the head\nis turned to the wind, and the stern to leeward Thus the ship A, fig 8 plate XI having made the necessary\ndispositions to veer, bears away gradually before the wind, till it blows\nobliquely upon the opposite side, which was formerly to leeward, as\nat a; and as the stern necessarily yields to this impression of the wind,\nassisted by the force of the helm, and the action of the waves upon\nthe same quarter, the side which was formerly to leeward soon\nbecomes to windward, as in the point a Since, by this movement, a ship loses ground considerably more\nthan by tacking, it is rarely practised except in cases of necessity or\ndelay: as, when the violence of the wind and sea renders tacking\nimpracticable; or when her course is slackened to wait for a pilot, or\n\n\nsome other ship in company, &c It has been observed in the article Tacking, that the change of\nmotion in any body, will be in proportion to the moving force impressed,\nand made according to the right line in which that force operates Hence it\nis evident, that veering as well as tacking is a necessary consequence\nof the same invariable principle; for as, in the latter, almost the whole\nforce of the wind and of the helm are exerted on the hind part of the\nship, to turn the prow to windward; so, in the former, the same\nimpression, assisted by the efforts of the helm, falls upon the prow, to\npush it to leeward; and the motion communicated to the ship must in\nboth cases necessarily conspire with the action of the wind Thus, when it becomes necessary to veer the ship, the sails towards\nthe stern are either furled, or brailed up, and made to shiver in the\nwind; whilst those near the head are spread abroad, so as to collect\nthe whole current of air which their surfaces can contain Hence,\nwhile the whole force of the wind is exerted on the fore part of the\nship to turn her about, its effect is considerably diminished, or\naltogether destroyed, on the surfaces of the after-sails The fore part\naccordingly yields to the above impulse, and is put in motion; and this\nmovement, conspiring with that of the wind, pushes the ship about as\nmuch as is necessary to produce the effect required When she is\nturned so that the wind will act upon that quarter which was formerly\nto leeward, as at the point a, fig 8",
    "8 her circular motion will be\naccelerated by extending some of the sails near the stern, as the\nmizen, and by placing those at the prow more obliquely, which will\nwheel the vessel round with her bow to the windward; in the same\nsituation, with regard to the wind, as when close-hauled, or tacking When the tempest is so violent as to prevent the use of sails, the\neffort of the wind operates almost equally on the opposite ends of the\nship, so that the masts and yards situated at the head and stern\ncounterbalance each other The effect of the helm is also considerably\ndiminished, because the head-way, which gives life and vigour to all\nits operations, is at this time feeble and ineffectual Hence it is\nnecessary to defray this equilibrium which subsists between the masts\nand yards afore and abaft, and to throw the balance forward, in order\nto prepare for veering This is accordingly performed by bracing the\nforemost yards across the direction of the wind, and arranging those\non the main-mast and mizen mast directly in the line of the wind If\nthis expedient proves unsuccessful, and it is absolutely necessary to\nveer, in order to save the ship from destruction, by oversetting or\n\n\nrunning ashore, the mizen-mast must instantly be cut away, and even\nthe main-mast, if she yet remains incapable of answering the helm by\nbearing away before the wind VENT See the articles Cannon and Windage VESSEL, batiment, a general name given to the different sorts of\nships which are navigated on the ocean, or in canals and rivers It is,\nhowever, more particularly applied to those of the smaller kind,\nfurnished with one or two masts It has already been remarked in the article Ship, that the views of\nutility, which ought always to be considered in a work of this kind,\nseemed to limit our general account of shipping to those which are\nmost frequently employed in European navigation We have therefore\ncollected into one point of view the principal of these in plate XII ;

and fig 14 a sloop The ketch, whose sails are furled, is furnished with a try-sail, like\nthe snow; and it has a fore-sail, fore-staysail, and jib, nearly similar to\nthose of a sloop; but the sails on the main-mast and mizen-mast are\nlike those of a ship The main-sail and main-topsail of the brig are like\nthose of the schooner; and the fore-mast is rigged and equipped with\nsails in the same manner as the ship and snow The sails, masts, and\nyards of the xebec, being extremely different from these, are described\nat large under the article In the schooner both the mainsail and\nforesail are extended by a boom and gaff, as likewise is the sloop’s\nmainsail;

and the\nvoyal being much lighter and more pliant, is infinitely more\n\n\nconvenient in this exercise See the articles Capstern and Nipper If the cable is drawn into the ship by the main capstern, the voyal is\nused without any block: but if the capstern in the fore-part of the ship\nbe employed for this purpose, the voyal usually passes through a large\nblock attached to the main-mast;

and\nwhich are apparently supported by philosophical reasoning Dr Franklin, in his physical and meteorological observations,\nsupposes a water-spout and a whirlwind to proceed from the same\ncause, their only difference being, that the latter passes over the land,\nand the former over the water This opinion is corroborated by M de\nla Pryme, in the Philosophical Transactions; where he describes two\nspouts observed at different times in Yorkshire, whose appearances in\nthe air were exactly like those of the spouts at sea; and their effects\nthe same as those of real whirlwinds Whirlwinds have generally a progressive as well as a circular\nmotion; so had what is called the spout at Topsham, described in the\nTransactions; and this also by its effects appears to have been a real\nwhirlwind Water-spouts have also a progressive motion, which is\nmore or less rapid; being in some violent, and in others barely\nperceptible Whirlwinds generally rise after calms and great heats: the same is\nobserved of water-spouts, which are therefore most frequent in the\nwarm latitudes The wind blows every way from a large surrounding space to a\nwhirlwind Three vessels employed in the whale-fishery, happening to\nbe becalmed, lay in sight of each other, at about a league distance, and\nin the form of a triangle After some time a water-spout appeared near\n\n\nthe middle of the triangle; when a brisk gale arose, and every vessel\nmade sail It then appeared to them all by the trimming of their sails,\nand the course of each vessel, that the spout was to leeward of every\none of them; and this observation was farther confirmed by the\ncomparing of accounts, when the different observers afterwards\nconferred about the subject Hence whirlwinds and water-spouts agree\nin this particular likewise But if the same meteor which appears a water-spout at sea, should,\nin its progressive motion, encounter and pass over land, and there\nproduce all the phenomena and effects of a whirlwind, it would afford\na stronger conviction that a whirlwind and a water-spout are the same\nthing",
    "But if the same meteor which appears a water-spout at sea, should,\nin its progressive motion, encounter and pass over land, and there\nproduce all the phenomena and effects of a whirlwind, it would afford\na stronger conviction that a whirlwind and a water-spout are the same\nthing An ingenious correspondent of Dr Franklin gives one instance\nof this that fell within his own observation[57] A fluid moving from all points horizontally towards a center, must,\nat that center, either mount or descend If a hole be opened in the\nmiddle of the bottom of a tub filled with water, the water will flow\nfrom all sides to the center, and there descend in a whirl But air\nflowing on or near the surface of land or water, from all sides towards\na center, must at that center ascend; because the land or water will\nhinder its descent If these concentring currents of air be in the upper region, they may\nindeed descend in the spout or whirlwind; but then, when the united\ncurrent reached the earth or water, it would spread, and probably\nblow every way from the center There may be whirlwinds of both\nkinds; but from the effects commonly observed, Dr Franklin suspects\nthe rising one to be most frequent: when the upper air descends, it is\nperhaps in a greater body extending wider, as in thunder-gusts, and\nwithout much whirling; and when air descends in a spout or\nwhirlwind, he conceives that it would rather press the roof of a house\ninwards, or force in the tiles, shingles, or thatch, and force a boat\ndown into the water, or a piece of timber into the earth, than snatch\nthem upwards, and carry them away The whirlwinds and spouts are not always, though most frequently,\nin the day-time The terrible whirlwind which damaged a great part of\nRome, June 11",

    "The\ncoldness of the upper region is manifested by the hail, which\nsometimes falls from it in warm weather 2 2 That heated air may be\nvery moist, and yet the moisture so equally diffused and rarified as\nnot to be visible till colder air mixes with it, at which time it\ncondenses and becomes visible Thus our breath, although invisible in\nsummer, becomes visible in winter These circumstances being granted, he presupposes a tract of land\nor sea, of about sixty miles in extent, unsheltered by clouds and\nunrefreshed by the wind, during a summer’s day, or perhaps for\nseveral days without intermission, till it becomes violently heated,\ntogether with the lower region of the air in contact with it, so that the\nlatter becomes specifically lighter than the superincumbent higher\nregion of the atmosphere, wherein the clouds are usually floated: he\nsupposes also that the air surrounding this tract has not been so much\nheated during those days, and therefore remains heavier The\nconsequence of this, he conceives, should be, that the heated lighter\nair should ascend, and the heavier descend; and as this rising cannot\noperate throughout the whole tract at once, because that would leave\ntoo extensive a vacuum, the rising will begin precisely in that column\nwhich happens to be lighted, or most rarified; and the warm air will\nflow horizontally from all parts to this column, where the several\ncurrents meeting, and joining to rise, a whirl is naturally formed, in\nthe same manner as a whirl is formed in a tub of water, by the\ndescending fluid receding from all sides of the tub towards the hole in\nthe center And as the several currents arrive at this central rising column, with\na considerable degree of horizontal motion, they cannot suddenly\nchange it to a vertical motion; therefore, as they gradually, in\n\n\napproaching the whirl, decline from right to curve or circular lines,\nso, having joined the whirl, they ascend by a spiral motion; in the\nsame manner as the water descends spirally through the hole in the\ntub before mentioned Lastly, as the lower air nearest the surface is more rarified by the\nheat of the sun, it is more impressed by the current of the surrounding\ncold and heavy air which is to assume its place, and consequently its\nmotion towards the whirl is swiftest, and so the force of the lower\npart of the whirl strongest, and the centrifugal force of its particles\ngreatest Hence the vacuum which encloses the axis of the whirl\nshould be greatest near the earth or sea, and diminish gradually as it\napproaches the region of the clouds, till it ends in a point This circle is of various diameters, sometimes very large If the vacuum passes over water, the water may rise in a body or\ncolumn therein to the height of about thirty-two feet This whirl of air\nmay be as invisible as the air itself, though reaching in reality from\nthe water to the region of cool air, in which our low summer thunder-\nclouds commonly float; but it will soon become visible at its\nextremities The agitation of the water under the whirling of the\ncircle, and the swelling and rising of the water in the commencement\nof the vacuum, renders it visible below It is perceived above by the\nwarm air being brought up to the cooler region, where its moisture\nbegins to be condensed by the cold into thick vapour; and is then first\ndiscovered at the highest part; which being now cooled, condenses\nwhat rises behind it, and this latter acts in the same manner on the\nsucceeding body; where, by the contact of the vapours, the cold\noperates faster in a right line downwards, than the vapours\nthemselves can climb in a spiral line upwards; they climb, however,\nand as by continual addition they grow denser, and by consequence\nincrease their centrifugal force, and being risen above the\nconcentrating currents that compose the whirl, they fly off, and form\na cloud It seems easy to conceive, how, by this successive condensation\nfrom above, the spout appears to drop or descend from the cloud,\nalthough the materials of which it is composed are all the while\nascending The condensation of the moisture contained in so great a\nquantity of warm air as may be supposed to rise in a short time in this\nprodigiously rapid whirl, is perhaps sufficient to form a great extent of\ncloud: and the friction of the whirling air on the sides of the column\nmay detach great quantities of its water, disperse them into drops, and\n\n\ncarry them up in the spiral whirl mixed with the air The heavier\ndrops may indeed fly off, and fall into a shower about the spout; but\nmuch of it will be broken into vapour, and yet remain visible As the whirl weakens, the tube may apparently separate in the\nmiddle; the column of water subsiding, the superior condensed part\ndrawing up to the cloud The tube or whirl of air may nevertheless\nremain entire, the middle only becoming invisible, as not containing\nany visible matter",
    "The tube or whirl of air may nevertheless\nremain entire, the middle only becoming invisible, as not containing\nany visible matter Dr Stuart, in the Philosophical Transactions, says, “It was observable\nof all the spouts he saw, but more perceptible of a large one, that\ntowards the end it began to appear like a hollow canal, only black in\nthe borders, but white in the middle; and though it was at first\naltogether black and opaque, yet the sea-water could very soon after\nbe perceived to fly up along the middle of this canal like smoke in a\nchimney ”\nWhen Dr Stuart’s spouts were full charged, that is, when the\nwhirling pipe of air was filled with quantities of drops and vapour\ntorn off from the column, the whole was rendered so dark that it\ncould not be seen through, nor the spiral ascending motion\ndiscovered; but when the quantity ascending lessened, the pipe\nbecame more transparent, and the ascending motion visible The\nspiral motion of the vapours, whose lines intersect each other on the\nnearest and farthest side of this transparent part, appeared therefore\nto Stuart like smoke ascending in a chimney; for the quantity being\nstill too great in the line of sight through the sides of the tube, the\nmotion could not be discovered there, and so they represented the\nsolid sides of the chimney The\nspiral motion of the vapours, whose lines intersect each other on the\nnearest and farthest side of this transparent part, appeared therefore\nto Stuart like smoke ascending in a chimney; for the quantity being\nstill too great in the line of sight through the sides of the tube, the\nmotion could not be discovered there, and so they represented the\nsolid sides of the chimney Dr Franklin concludes by supposing a whirlwind or spout to be\nstationary, when the concurring winds are equal but if unequal, the\nwhirl acquires a progressive motion in the direction of the strongest\npressure When the wind that communicates this progression becomes\nstronger above than below, or below than above, the spout will be\nbent or inclined Hence the horizontal process and obliquity of water-\nspouts are derived Water-way, gouttiere, a long piece of timber serving to connect the\nsides of a ship to her decks, and form a sort of channel to carry off the\nwater from the latter by means of scuppers See that article The convexity of the decks, represented by N, M, N, in the Midship-\nframe, plate VII necessarily carries the water towards the sides,\nwhere this piece is fixed, which is principally designed to prevent the\n\n\nwater from lodging in the seams, so as to rot the wood and oakum\ncontained therein The water-ways N N are therefore hollowed in the\nmiddle lengthways, so as to form a kind of gutter or channel, one side\nof which lies almost horizontally, making part of the deck, whilst the\nother rises upwards, and corresponds with the side, of which it\nlikewise makes a part They are scored down about an inch and a half,\nor two inches, upon the beams, and rest upon lodging-knees or\ncarlings They are secured by bolts driven from without through the\nplanks, timbers, and water-ways, and clinched upon rings on the\ninside of the latter The scuppers, which are holes by which the water escapes from off\nthe deck, are accordingly cut through the water-ways WAVE, a volume of water elevated by the action of the wind upon\nits surface, into a state of fluctuation",
    "WAVE, a volume of water elevated by the action of the wind upon\nits surface, into a state of fluctuation Mr Mr Boyle has proved, by a variety of experiments, that the utmost\nforce of the wind never penetrates deeper than six feet into the water;\nand it should seem a natural consequence of this, that the water put in\nmotion by it can only be elevated to the same height of six feet from\nthe level of the surface in a calm This six feet of elevation being then\nadded to the six of excavation, in the part whence that water was\nraised, should give twelve feet for the greatest elevation of a wave,\nwhen the height of it is not increased by whirlwinds, or the\ninterruption of rocks or shoals, which always gives an additional\nelevation to the natural swell of the waves We are not to suppose, from this calculation, that no wave of the\nsea can rise more than six feet above its natural level in open and\ndeep water; for some immensely higher than these are formed in\nviolent tempests, in the great seas These, however, are not to be\naccounted waves in their natural state; but they are single waves\ncomposed of many others: for in these wide plains of water, when one\nwave is raised by the wind, and would elevate itself up to the exact\nheight of six feet, and no more, the motion of the water is so great,\nand the succession of the waves so quick, that during the time\nwherein this rises, it receives into it several other waves, each of\nwhich would have been of the same height with itself These\naccordingly run into the first wave, one after another as it rises: by\nthis means its rise is continued much longer than it would naturally\nhave been, and it becomes accumulated to an enormous size A\nnumber of these complicated waves arising together, and being\ncontinued in a long succession by the duration of the storm, make the\n\n\nwaves so dangerous to shipping, which the sailors, in their phrase, call\nmountains high WAY of a ship, the course or progress which she makes on the water\nunder sail Thus, when she begins her motion, she is said to be under\nway; and when that motion increases, she is said to have fresh way\nthrough the water Hence also she is said to have head-way or stern-\nway See those articles WEARING See the article Veering",

    "1st Between the limits of 60 degrees, namely, from 30° of north\nlatitude to 30° of south latitude, there is a constant east wind\nthroughout the year, blowing on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans; and\nthis is called the trade-wind For as the sun, in moving from east to west, heats the air more\nimmediately under him, and thereby expands it; the air to the\neastward is constantly rushing towards the west to restore the\nequilibrium, or natural state of the atmosphere; and this occasions a\nperpetual east wind in those limits For as the sun, in moving from east to west, heats the air more\nimmediately under him, and thereby expands it; the air to the\neastward is constantly rushing towards the west to restore the\nequilibrium, or natural state of the atmosphere; and this occasions a\nperpetual east wind in those limits 2d The trade-winds near their northern limits blow between the\nnorth and east, and near the southern limits they blow between the\nsouth and east For as the air is expanded by the heat of the sun near the equator;\ntherefore the air from the northward and southward will both tend\ntowards the equator to restore the equilibrium Now these motions\nfrom the north and south, joined with the foregoing easterly motion,\nwill produce the motions observed near the said limits between the\nnorth and east, and between the south and west 3d 3d These general motions of the wind are disturbed on the\ncontinents, and near their coasts For the nature of the soil may either cause the air to be heated or\ncooled; and hence will arise motions that may be contrary to the\nforegoing general one",
    "For the nature of the soil may either cause the air to be heated or\ncooled; and hence will arise motions that may be contrary to the\nforegoing general one 4th 4th In some parts of the Indian ocean there are periodical winds,\nwhich are called Monsoons; that is, such as blow half the year one\nway, and the other half-year the contrary way For air that is cool and dense, will force the warm and rarefied air\nin a continual stream upwards, where it must spread itself to preserve\nthe equilibrium: so that the upper course or current of the air shall be\ncontrary to the under current; for the upper air must move from those\nparts where the greatest heat is; and so, by a kind of circulation, the\nN E trade-wind below will be attended with a S W above; and a S E below with a N W above: And this is confirmed by the experience\nof seamen, who, as soon as they get out of the trade-winds, generally\nfind a wind blowing from the opposite quarter 5th 5th In the Atlantic ocean, near the coasts of Africa, at about 100\nleagues from shore between the latitudes of 28° and 10° north, seamen\nconstantly meet with a fresh gale of wind blowing from the N E 6th Those bound to the Caribbee islands, across the Atlantic ocean,\nfind, as they approach the American side, that the said N E wind\nbecomes easterly; or seldom blows more than a point from the east,\neither to the northward or southward These trade-winds, on the American side, are extended to 30, 31, or\neven to 32° of N latitude; which is about 4° farther than what they\nextend to on the African side: Also, to the southward of the equator,\nthe trade-winds extend three or four degrees farther towards the coast\nof Brasil on the American side, than they do near the Cape of Good\nHope on the African side",

    "And first The difficulty which ships in going to the southward,\nespecially in the months of July and August, find in passing between\nthe coast of Guinea and Brasil, notwithstanding the width of this sea\nis more than 500 leagues The difficulty which ships in going to the southward,\nespecially in the months of July and August, find in passing between\nthe coast of Guinea and Brasil, notwithstanding the width of this sea\nis more than 500 leagues This happens, because the S E winds at\nthat time of the year commonly extend some degrees beyond the\nordinary limits of 4° N latitude; and besides coming so much\nsoutherly, as to be sometimes south, sometimes a point or two to the\nwest; it then only remains to ply to windward: And if, on the one side,\nthey steer W S W W they get a wind more and more easterly; but then\nthere is danger of falling in with the Brasilian coast, or shoals: and if\n\n\nthey steer E S E E they fall into the neighbourhood of the coast of\nGuinea, from whence they cannot depart without running easterly as\nfar as the island of St Thomas; and this is the constant practice of all\nthe Guinea ships Secondly All ships departing from Guinea for Europe, their direct\ncourse is northward; but on this course they cannot proceed, because\nthe coast bending nearly east and west, the land is to the northward Therefore, as the winds on this coast are generally between the S",
    "Therefore, as the winds on this coast are generally between the S and\nW S W they are obliged to steer S S E E or south, and with these\ncourses they run off the shore; but in so doing they always find the\nwinds more and more contrary; so that when near the shore, they can\nlie south; but at a greater distance they can make no better than S or south, and with these\ncourses they run off the shore; but in so doing they always find the\nwinds more and more contrary; so that when near the shore, they can\nlie south; but at a greater distance they can make no better than S E and afterwards E S E ; with which courses they commonly fetch the\nisland of St Thomas and Cape Lopez, where finding the winds to the\neastward of the south, they sail westerly with it, till coming to the\nlatitude of four degrees south, where they find the S Thomas and Cape Lopez, where finding the winds to the\neastward of the south, they sail westerly with it, till coming to the\nlatitude of four degrees south, where they find the S E wind blowing\nperpetually On account of these general winds, all those that use the West India\ntrade, and even those bound to Virginia, reckon it their best course to\nget as soon as they can to the southward, that so they may be certain\nof a fair and fresh gale to run before it to the westward: And for the\nsame reason those homeward-bound from America endeavour to gain\nthe latitude of 30 degrees, where they first find the winds begin to be\nvariable; though the most ordinary winds in the north Atlantic ocean\ncome from between the south and west",

    "The winds are not quite so certain as\nthose in the Arabian seas 14th Between Sumatra and Java to the west, and New Guinea to\nthe east, the same northerly and southerly winds are observed; but the\nfirst half year Monsoon inclines to the N Between Sumatra and Java to the west, and New Guinea to\nthe east, the same northerly and southerly winds are observed; but the\nfirst half year Monsoon inclines to the N W and the latter to the S E E These winds begin a month or six weeks after those in the Chinese\nseas set in, and are quite as variable 15th 15th These contrary winds do not shift from one point to its\nopposite all at once; and in some places the time of the change is\nattended with calms, in others by variable winds: and it often happens\non the shores of Coromandel and China, towards the end of the\nMonsoons, that there are most violent storms, greatly resembling the\nhurricanes in the West Indies; wherein the wind is so excessively\nstrong, that hardly any thing can resist its force All navigation in the Indian ocean must necessarily be regulated by\nthese winds; for if mariners should delay their voyages till the\ncontrary Monsoon begins, they must either sail back, or go into\nharbour, and wait for the return of the trade-wind The relative force of the wind upon a ship’s sails, and the epithets\nby which it is distinguished, as fair, large, &c according to the angle\nwhich it makes with her course, are explained in the article Sailing Reigning Wind See Reigning Wind To Wind a ship or boat, is to change her position, by bringing the\nstern to lie in the situation of the head;

because their whole weight and\nstrength are applied more readily to the end of the lever employed to\nturn it about Whereas, in the horizontal movement of the capstern,\nthe exertion of their force is considerably diminished It requires,\nhowever, some dexterity and address to manage the handspec to the\ngreatest advantage; and to perform this the sailors must all rise at\nonce upon the windlass, and, fixing their bars therein, give a sudden\njerk at the same instant, in which movement they are regulated by a\n\n\nsort of song or howl pronounced by one of their number The most dextrous managers of the handspec in heaving at the\nwindlass are generally supposed the colliers of Northumberland: and\nof all European mariners, the Dutch are certainly the most aukward\nand sluggish in this manœuvre WINDSAIL, a sort of wide tube or funnel of canvas, employed to\nconvey a stream of fresh air downward into the lower apartments of a\nship This machine is usually extended by large hoops situated in\ndifferent parts of its height It is let down perpendicularly through the\nhatches, being expanded at the lower end like the base of a cone; and\nhaving its upper part open on the side which is placed to windward,\nso as to receive the full current of the wind; which, entering the\ncavity, fills the tube, and rushes downwards into the lower regions of\nthe ship There are generally three or four of these in our capital ships\nof war, which, together with the ventilators, contribute greatly to\npreserve the health of the crew WINGS, a name given to those parts of a ship’s hold which are\nnearest to the sides, or farthest removed from the middle of her\nbreadth This term is particularly used in the stowage of the several\nmaterials contained in the hold; as, Stow the large casks amidships,\nand the smaller barrels in the wings See Trim and Stowage Wings are also the skirts or extremities of a fleet when it is ranged\ninto a line a-breast, or when bearing away upon two sides of an angle Thus the ships a, b fig 10 & 11 plate V are in the wings of their\nfleet or squadron It is usual to extend the wings of a fleet in the day-time, in order to\ndiscover any enemy which may fall into their track To prevent\nseparation, however, they are commonly summoned to draw nearer to\nthe center of the squadron before night, by a signal from the\ncommander in chief, which is afterwards repeated by ships in the\nintervals WOOLDING, surlier, (woelen, Dut ) the act of winding a piece of\nrope about a mast or yard, to support it in a place where it may have\nbeen fished or scarfed; or when it is composed of several pieces united\ninto one solid See Mast Woolding is also the rope employed in this service Those which\nare fixed on the lower masts, are represented in a, fig 1, 2, & 3 plate\nVI To WORK, manœuvrer, to direct the movements of a ship, by\nadapting the sails to the force and direction of the wind A ship is also said to work, when she strains and labours heavily in\na tempestuous sea, so as to loosen her joints or timbers See Pitching\nand Rolling WORKING to windward, the operation by which a ship endeavours\nto make a progress against the wind See Beating, Plying, Turning,\nand Tacking WORMING, emieller, the act of winding a rope spirally about a\ncable, so as to lie close along the interval between every two strands It is generally designed to support and strengthen the cable, that it\nmay be enabled to sustain a greater effort when the ship rides at\nanchor; and also to preserve the surface of the cable, where it lies flat\nupon the ground, near the station of the anchor: particularly in\nmoderate weather WRECK, the ruins of a ship which has been stranded or dashed to\npieces on a shelf, rock, or lee-shore, by tempestuous weather Conclusion of the article Pump As we wish to pay all possible attention in this work to every\nimprovement in the marine, we have exhibited in plate VIII a section\nof this machine at large, as fixed in a frigate of war, fig",

and of a\ngreat breadth, to enable her to carry a great force of sail for this\npurpose, without danger of overturning As these vessels are usually\nvery low-built, their decks are formed with a great convexity from the\nmiddle of their breadth towards the sides, in order to carry off the\nwater, which falls aboard, more readily by their scuppers But as this\nextreme convexity would render it very difficult to walk thereon at\nsea, particularly when the vessel rocks by the agitation of the waves,\nthere is a platform of grating extending along the deck from the sides\nof the vessel towards the middle, whereon the crew may walk dry-\nfooted, whilst the water is conveyed through the grating to the\nscuppers When a xebec is equipped for war, she is occasionally navigated in\nthree different methods, according to the force or direction of the\nwind Thus, when the wind is fair, and nearly astern, it is usual to extend\nsquare sails upon the main-mast; and indeed frequently on the fore-\nmast: and as those sails are rarely used in a scant wind, they are of an\nextraordinary breadth When the wind is unfavourable to the course, and yet continues\nmoderate, the square yards and sails are removed from the masts, and\nlaid by, in order to make way for the large lateen yards and sails,\nwhich soon after assume their place: but if the foul wind increases to\na storm, these latter are also lowered down and displaced; and small\nlateen yards with proportional sails are extended on all the masts The xebecs, which are generally armed as vessels of war by the\nAlgerines, mount from sixteen to twenty-four cannon, and carry from\n\n\n300 to 450 men, two thirds of whom are generally soldiers By the very complicated and inconvenient method of working these\nvessels, it will be readily believed, what one of their captains of\nAlgiers acquainted the author, viz That the crew of every xebec has at\nleast the labour of three square-rigged ships, wherein the standing sails\nare calculated to answer every situation of the wind Y YACHT, a vessel of state, usually employed to convey princes,\nambassadors, or other great personages from one kingdom to another As the principal design of a yacht is to accommodate the\npassengers, it is usually fitted with a variety of convenient\napartments, with suitable furniture, according to the quality or\nnumber of the persons contained therein The royal yachts are commonly rigged as ketches, except the\nprincipal one reserved for the sovereign, which is equipped with three\nmasts like a ship They are in general elegantly furnished, and richly\nornamented with sculpture; and always commanded by captains in his\nmajesty’s navy Besides these, there are many other yachts of a smaller kind,\nemployed by the commissioners of the excise, navy, and customs; or\nused as pleasure-boats by private gentlemen YARD, vergue, a long piece of timber suspended upon the masts of a\nship, to extend the sails to the wind See Mast and Sail All yards are either square or lateen; the former of which are\nsuspended across the mast at right angles, and the latter obliquely The square-yards, fig 1 plate IX are nearly of a cylindrical surface They taper from the middle, which is called the slings, towards the\nextremities which are termed the yard-arms; and the distance between\nthe slings and the yard-arms on each side, is, by the artificers, divided\ninto quarters, which are distinguished into the first, second, third\nquarters, and yard-arms The middle quarters are formed into eight\nsquares, and each of the end parts is figured like the frustrum of a\ncone All the yards of a ship are square except that of the mizen The proportions for the length of yards, according to the different\nclasses of ships in the British navy, are as follows:\n \n \nGuns 1000 : gun-deck ::\n560 :\nmain yard\nexpressed by d,\nfig 1 plate IX Note, the figure\nrepresents the\nyards and sails of\na ship of 74\nguns 100\n559 :\n90 80\n570 :\n70\n576 :\n60\n575 :\n50\n561 :\n44\n \n1000 : main-yard ::\n880 :\nfore-yard\n100 90\n80\n874 :\nall the\nrest To apply this rule to\npractice, suppose the\ngun-deck 144 feet The\nproportion for this length\nis as 1000 is to 575, so is\n144 to 83;
