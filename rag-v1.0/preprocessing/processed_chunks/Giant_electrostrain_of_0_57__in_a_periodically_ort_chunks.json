    "It can be seen from Fig 3(a) that the maximum switching strain in\n\n\nRegion A can reach up to 0 57% at 2kV/mm, about 4 times of that in conventional\n\n\nPZT ceramics (which is about 0 14% at 2kV/mm) Furthermore, the large switching\n\n\nstrain is totally reversible with small hysteresis Furthermore, the large switching\n\n\nstrain is totally reversible with small hysteresis Fig Fig 3(b) shows that the polarization\n\n\nvariations in this periodically poled PZT-5H is very large compared to that of the\n\n\nconventional PZT-5H, which is mainly caused by the non-180° domain switching in\n\n\n5\n\n\nRegion A 3(b) shows that the polarization\n\n\nvariations in this periodically poled PZT-5H is very large compared to that of the\n\n\nconventional PZT-5H, which is mainly caused by the non-180° domain switching in\n\n\n5\n\n\nRegion A Fig 3(c) shows the electrostrain curves in the center of Region A of the periodically\n\n\npoled PZT-5H with different loading/unloading periods (T) It can be seen that the\n\n\nelectrostrain increases significantly with the increasing period For T=2s, the\n\n\nmaximum strain under 2kV/mm is only about 0 2% with large hysteresis The\n\n\nmaximum strain increases to 0 45% for T=4s, 0 51% for T=6s, and reaches 0 57% for\n\n\nT=10s Meanwhile, the strain hysteresis decreases with the increasing period Note\n\n\nthat the eletostrain curves for T>10s almost overlapped with that for T=10s, indicating\n\n\nthat T=10s is long enough to saturate the large reversible strain caused by domain\n\n\nswitching Due to the current limitation (2mA) of the high-voltage amplifier, testing\n\n\nwith T<2s was not conducted",
    "Due to the current limitation (2mA) of the high-voltage amplifier, testing\n\n\nwith T<2s was not conducted Fig 3(d) shows the maximum electrostrain profile along the length direction under\n\n\n2kV/mm with the loading/unloading period of 10s It can be seen that the strain\n\n\nprofile is almost symmetric about the center of Region A The maximum strain under\n\n\n2kV/mm decreases gradually from 0 57% at center of Region A to 0 32% at center of\n\n\nRegion C, i e , non-uniform strain was generated along the length direction Note that\n\n\nthe strain of 0 32% at center of Region C is also considerably larger than that of 0 14%\n\n\nfor conventional PZT-5H 6\n\n\nFig 6\n\n\nFig 4 Mechanism of large reversible strain in the periodically orthogonal poled PZT-5H ceramics (a) The generated shearing stress on the interface between Region C and Region A; (b)\n\n\nElectrostrain curves for the irreversible domain switching in conventional PZT-5H and for the\n\n\nconstrained reversible switching strain in Region A; (c) Electrostrain curves for the piezoelectric\n\n\nstrain in conventional PZT-5H and for the enhanced strain in Region C Now let us discuss the mechanism of large reversible switching strain in this\n\n\nperiodically poled PZT-5H When applying a large electric field on this PZT-5H\n\n\nsample, non-180° domain switching occurred, leading to large switching strain in\n\n\nRegion A While the piezoelectric strain in the adjacent Region C is quite small Therefore, the misfit strain will generate shearing stresses on the interface between\n\n\n7\n\n\nRegion A and Region C, as shown in Fig 4(a) The interfacial shearing stress is apt to\n\n\nstretch Region C and compress Region A Therefore, the constrained switching strain\n\n\nin Region A should be smaller than the free switching strain from the in-plane poled\n\n\nstate to the vertical poled state (in Fig 1b), and the strain in Region C be larger than\n\n\nthat of conventional PZT-5H To verify this, the irreversible domain switching in\n\n\nshown in Fig 1(b) was also conducted in another PZT-5H sample and the electrostrain\n\n\ncurves for the initial two cycles of uni-polar electric loading were plotted in Fig 4(b) For comparison, the constrained electrostrain curve (with T=10s) in the center of\n\n\nRegion A is also presented in Fig 4(b)",
    "4(b) It can be seen that for the first cycle loading,\n\n\nthese two curves almost overlapped, which may indicate that the interfacial stresses\n\n\nonly has a slight influence on the non-180° domain switching at the center of Region\n\n\nA Upon removing the electric field, the large interfacial stress will cause back\n\n\ndomain switching in Region A, thus the large switching strain can be reversible Since\n\n\nthe interfacial stress is not constant but increases gradually with the applied electric\n\n\nfield, both the domain switching and back switching are gradual processes, leading to\n\n\nvery small hysteresis in the electrostrain curves, the underlying mechanism is similar\n\n\nto that of the reduced strain hysteresis in a relaxor/ferroelectric composite [19] As to\n\n\nthe irreversible domain switching PZT-5H sample, the irreversible strain even\n\n\nincrease upon electric unloading and can reach about 0 As to\n\n\nthe irreversible domain switching PZT-5H sample, the irreversible strain even\n\n\nincrease upon electric unloading and can reach about 0 63% Thus, at the center of\n\n\nRegion A, about 90% (=0 57/0 63) of the total switching strain can be reversible To understand the effect of interfacial stress on the electrostrain in Region C, the\n\n\nelectostrain curve (T=10s) in the center of Region C was plotted in Fig 4(c) together\n\n\nwith the electrostrain curve of a conventional PZT-5H It can be seen that when the\n\n\nfield is less than 900V/mm (slightly larger than the PZT’s coercive field of 750V/mm),\n\n\nthe two curves almost overlapped By comparing the strain curves in both Fig 4(b)\n\n\nand 4(c) below 900V/mm, we can see that at this stage the misfit strain between\n\n\nRegion C and Region A is very small (<0 1%), so the interfacial stress is also small\n\n\nand it has little effect on the piezoelectric strain in Region C The misfit strain\n\n\nincreases with the increasing electric field, so as to the interfacial stress, leading to the\n\n\n8\n\n\nincreased strain in Region C due to partial non-180° domain switching With regard to the loading frequency dependent switching strain as shown in Fig 3(c),\n\n\nwe think it is due to the current limit (2mA) of the high-voltage amplifier Because\n\n\ndomain switching in this periodically poled PZT-5H is accompanied by large\n\n\npolarization variations (as shown in Fig 3b), in short-period loading, the amplifier\n\n\ncannot supply enough current thus charge into the sample, resulted incomplete\n\n\ndomain switching When the loading/unloading period is long enough (10s in this\n\n\nwork), complete domain switching may accomplish and the switching strain saturates,\n\n\ni",
    "When the loading/unloading period is long enough (10s in this\n\n\nwork), complete domain switching may accomplish and the switching strain saturates,\n\n\ni e e , further increasing the loading period will not enhance the switching strain any\n\n\nmore Quick domain switching is expected if using a large-current amplifier, which\n\n\nwill be conducted in the future works Quick domain switching is expected if using a large-current amplifier, which\n\n\nwill be conducted in the future works Fig 5 The electrostrain curves at center of Region A in the periodically poled PZT-5H after 1, 5000\n\n\nand 10000 cycles of electric loading (Loading/unloading period of 10s)\n\n\nFig 5 shows the electrostrain curves at center of Region A in the periodically poled\n\n\nPZT-5H after 1, 5000 and 10000 cycles of loading with the period of 10s It can be\n\n\nseen that the large reversible strain keeps quite stable and even slightly increases\n\n\n(from 0 57% to 0 58%) after 10 [4] cycles of loading The slightly increase in the\n\n\nmaximum strain may be due to the interfacial stress relaxation after cycles of domain\n\n\n9\n\n\nswitching The large, reversible and stable switching strain is very promising for\n\n\nnext-generation large-strain actuators The large, reversible and stable switching strain is very promising for\n\n\nnext-generation large-strain actuators Fig Fig 6 Schematic design of a multilayer actuator based on the periodically orthogonal poled\n\n\nferroelectric ceramics Arrow denotes poling directions Fig Fig 6 shows the schematic design of a multilayer actuator based on the periodically\n\n\northogonal poled ferroelectric ceramics The periodic directions of the neighboring\n\n\nlayers are orthogonal, thus the maximum switching strain of each layer can always be\n\n\nemployed It is expected the layer thickness, the applied prestress, the width of\n\n\nperiodic poling Region in each layer, etc , may considerably affect the performance of\n\n\nsuch a designed multilayer actuator, which will be systematically investigated in near\n\n\nfuture **4",
