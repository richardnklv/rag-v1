    "(1989)), it is well\nknown that a nonholonomic control system cannot be\nasymptotically stabilized to a resting configuration by\nsmooth time-invariant control laws (Bloch, A M ;\nReyhanoglu, M & McClamroch, N H (1992)) Despite\nthis, several discontinuous or time-variant approaches\nhave been proposed for stabilizing such systems in\n(Bloch, A Despite\nthis, several discontinuous or time-variant approaches\nhave been proposed for stabilizing such systems in\n(Bloch, A M ; Reyhanoglu, M & McClamroch, N H (1992)), (Indiveri, G (1999)), (Tayebi, A & Rachid, A (1997)), (Lee, T C ; Song, K T ; Lee, C H & Teng, C C (2001)) and (Kolmanovsky, I & McClamroch, N H (1995)) (1995)) The references above refer to systems with firstorder nonholonomic constraints, which can usually be\nexpressed in terms of nonintegrable linear velocity\nrelationships However, there is another kind of mobile\nrobot systems, which possess both first-order and secondorder nonholonomic constraints, such as our robot -Gyrover, bicycles and motorcycles Mobile robots have\ntheir inherent nonholonomic features, which can be\ndescribed as first-order nonholonomic constraints among\njoint velocities and Cartesian space velocities These arise\nwhen robots roll on the ground without slipping Because\nno actuators can be used directly for stabilization in the\nlateral direction, these systems are underactuated\nnonlinear systems This induces another nonholonomic\nconstraint of robots Thus, to compare with these above\nresearch works, our mobile robot systems -- Gyrover, is\nmore challenging to be controlled This paper can provide some ideas for that class of\nproblems In this paper, we want to control an\nunderactuated mobile robot system -- Gyrover There\nare two control inputs: one is the steering torque (or rate)\nand the other is the driving torque (or speed) However,\nwe have four independent generalized coordinates to\ncontrol: (1) the lean angle, (2) the heading angle, (3) the\nCartesian space _X_ axis, (4) the Cartesian space _Y_ axis",
    "However,\nwe have four independent generalized coordinates to\ncontrol: (1) the lean angle, (2) the heading angle, (3) the\nCartesian space _X_ axis, (4) the Cartesian space _Y_ axis Our previous papers (Au, K W & Xu, Y (1999)) and\n(Au, K W & Y Xu, (2000)) assume that the robot\nremains around the vertical position, which simplify this\nnonlinear system to a linear one Therefore validation of\nthe results can be limited Some work has been on the tracking of a rolling disk,\nsuch as in (Rui, C & McClamroch, N H (1995)),\nwhich assumed three control inputs in the direction of\nsteering, leaning and rolling, where no unactuated joint\nand no second-order constraint is presented (1995)),\nwhich assumed three control inputs in the direction of\nsteering, leaning and rolling, where no unactuated joint\nand no second-order constraint is presented In (Getz, N H (1995)), the author simplified the bicycle dynamic\nmodel, and used velocities as control inputs to enable\nthe lean angle (called “roll-angle” in that paper) to track\ntrajectories, which have continuous differentials However, the controller could not guarantee that the\nbicycle would not topple over, i However, the controller could not guarantee that the\nbicycle would not topple over, i e e the lean angle was\nout of range, before convergence In this paper, we focus on three control problems that\nhave not yet been solved for this robot The first\nproblem is the balance of the robot while standing The\nsecond problem is concerned with point to point control The third problem relates to following a straight line These three problems are of significance in controlling a\nsystem with both first-order and second-order\nnonholonomic constraints 23\n\n\n**2 Gyrover**\nWe have developed a single wheel, gyroscopically\nstabilized robot, Gyrover, over several generations, each\none more sophisticated, reliable and capable of better\nperformance (Brown, H B & Xu, Y (1996)) Figure 1\nshows a photograph of Gyrover Fig 1 A single wheel robot, Gyrover\n\n\nForward\n\n\nRear View Side View\n\n\nFig 2",
    "2 The basic configuration of Gyrover\n\nGyrover is a novel, single wheel gyroscopically stabilized\nrobot Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the\nmechanism design In brief, the robot is a sharp-edged\nwheel, inside of which an actuation mechanism is fitted The actuation mechanism consists of three separate\nactuators: (1) a spin motor, which spins a suspended\nflywheel at a high rate, imparting dynamic stability to the\nrobot; (2) a tilt motor, which controls the steering of the\nrobot; and (3) a drive motor, which causes forward and/or\nbackward acceleration, by driving the single wheel\ndirectly The behavior of Gyrover is based on the principle of\ngyroscopic precession as exhibited in the stability of a\nrolling wheel Because of its angular momentum, a\nspinning wheel tends to precess at right angles to an\napplied torque, according to the fundamental equation of\ngyroscopic precession:\n\n\n_T_ = ω _J_ × Ω\n\nwhere ω is the angular speed of the wheel, Ω is the\nwheel's precession rate, normal to the spin axis, _J_ is the\nwheel polar moment of inertia about the spin axis, and _T_\nis the applied torque, normal to the spin and precession\n\n\n24\n\n\n\naxes Therefore, when a rolling wheel leans to one side,\nrather than falling over, the gravitationally induced\ntorque causes the wheel to precess so that it turns in the\ndirection that it is leaning The robot supplements this\nbasic concept with the addition of an internal gyroscope\n-- the spinning flywheel -- nominally aligned with the\nwheel and spinning in the direction of forward motion The flywheel's angular momentum produces lateral\nstability when the wheel is stopped or moving slowly Gyrover has a number of potential advantages over\nmulti-wheeled vehicles:\n\n1 The entire system can be enclosed within the\nwheel to provide mechanical and environmental\nprotection for equipment and mechanisms",
    "The entire system can be enclosed within the\nwheel to provide mechanical and environmental\nprotection for equipment and mechanisms 2 Gyrover is resistant to getting stuck on obstacles\nbecause it has no body to hang up, no exposed\nappendages, and the entire exposed surface is _live_\n(driven) Gyrover is resistant to getting stuck on obstacles\nbecause it has no body to hang up, no exposed\nappendages, and the entire exposed surface is _live_\n(driven) 3 3 The tiltable flywheel can be used to right the\nvehicle from its statically stable, rest position (on\nits side) The wheel has no   “backside” on which\nto get stuck The wheel has no   “backside” on which\nto get stuck 4 4 Gyrover can turn in place by simply leaning and\nprecessing in the desired direction, with no special\nsteering mechanism, enhancing maneuverability Gyrover can turn in place by simply leaning and\nprecessing in the desired direction, with no special\nsteering mechanism, enhancing maneuverability 5 Single-point contact with the ground eliminates the\nneed to accommodate uneven surfaces and\n\nsimplifies control Single-point contact with the ground eliminates the\nneed to accommodate uneven surfaces and\n\nsimplifies control 6 Full drive traction is available because all the\n\nweight is on the single drive wheel 7 7 A large pneumatic tire may have very low groundcontact pressure, resulting in minimal disturbance\nto the surface and minimum rolling resistance The\ntire may be suitable for traveling on soft soils, sand,\nsnow or ice; riding over brush or other vegetation;\nor, with adequate buoyancy, for traveling on water Potential applications for Gyrover are numerous Because it can travel on both land and water, it may find\namphibious use on beaches or swampy areas, for\ngeneral transportation, exploration, rescue or recreation Similarly, with appropriate tread, it should\ntravel well over soft snow with good traction and\nminimal rolling resistance As a surveillance robot,\nGyrover's slim profile enables it to pass through\ndoorways and narrow passages, and its ability to turn in\nplace to maneuver in tight quarters Another potential\napplication is as a high-speed lunar vehicle, where the\nabsence of aerodynamic disturbances and low gravity\nwould permit efficient, high-speed mobility As\nGyrover's development progresses, we anticipate that\nother more specific uses will become evident **3",
    "**3 Inertia Matrix and Nonholonomic Constraints**\n\n\nThe kinematics and dynamics of Gyrover are different\nfrom those of unicycles, such as in (Aicardi, M ;\nCasalino, G ; Balestrino, A & Bicchi, A (1994)) The\ndifference lies in the assumption that the unicycle\nalways remains vertical On the contrary, Gyrover can\n\n\nbe considered as a rolling disk which is not constrained to\nthe vertical position and is connected to a high speed\nspinning flywheel This model can serve well as a\nsimplification for the study of a model of Gyrover Consider a disk rolling without slipping on a horizontal\n# plane as shown in Figure 3 Let ∑ o X, Y, Z and ∑ c x, y, z be the inertial frame whose x − y plane is\n\n\nanchored to the flat surface and the body coordinate frame\nwhose origin is located at a center of the rolling disk,\nrespectively Let ( _X_, _Y_, _Z_ ) be the Cartesian coordinates\n## of the center of mass ( ) c  with respect to the inertial\n# frame ∑ o Let A  denotes the point of the contact on\n\n\nthe disk The configuration of the disk can be described\nby six generalized coordinates ( _X_, _Y_, _Z_, α, β, γ ), where\n\n\nα is the steering (precession) angle measured from _X_ axis to the contact line, β∈ (,0 π ) is the lean (nutation)\n\nangle measured from _Z_ -axis to the _z_ and, γ is the\n\nrolling angle _R_ is the radius of Gyrover _m_, _I_ _x_, _I_ _y_, _I_ _z_ represent the total mass and the moment of\n\n\ninertia of Gyrover In the derivation of the model, we assume that the wheel\nrolls on the ground without slipping Based on the\nprevious derivation in (Xu, Y ;
