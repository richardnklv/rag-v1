to fit scores of quick-acting machines into the\ndaily routine of farm work and thereby lift heavy loads from the\nshoulders of men and women; to increase the output at less cost of\nhand labor and to improve the soil while producing more abundantly\nthan ever before; to suggest the use of suitable machines to\nmanufacture high-priced nutritious human foods from cheap farm by-\nproducts Illustrations are used to explain principles rather than to recommend\nany particular type or pattern of machine The old is contrasted with the new and the merits of both are\nexpressed THE AUTHOR CONTENTS\nCHAPTER I\nPAGE\nThe Farm Shop with Tools for Working Wood and\nIron\n9\nCHAPTER II\nFarm Shop Work\n50\nCHAPTER III\nGenerating Mechanical Power to Drive Modern Farm\nMachinery\n74\nCHAPTER IV\nDriven Machines\n100\nCHAPTER V\nWorking the Soil\n137\nCHAPTER VI\nHandling the Hay Crop\n163\nCHAPTER VII\nFarm Conveyances\n179\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nMiscellaneous Farm Conveniences\n197\nIndex\n241\n\n\nFARM MECHANICS\n\n\nCHAPTER I\nTHE FARM SHOP WITH TOOLS FOR WORKING WOOD\nAND IRON\nFARM SHOP AND IMPLEMENT HOUSE\nThe workshop and shed to hold farm implements should look as neat\nand attractive as the larger buildings Farm implements are expensive Farm machinery is even more so When such machinery is all properly\nhoused and kept in repair the depreciation is estimated at ten per cent\na year When the machines are left to rust and weather in the rain and\nwind the loss is simply ruinous More machinery is required on farms than formerly and it costs more Still it is not a question whether a farmer can afford a machine If he\nhas sufficient work for it he knows he cannot afford to get along\nwithout it and he must have a shed to protect it from the weather\nwhen not in use In the first place the implement shed should be large enough to\naccommodate all of the farm implements and machinery without\ncrowding and it should be well built and tight enough to keep out the\nwind and small animals, including chickens and sparrows The perspective and plan shown herewith is twenty-four feet in width\nand sixty feet in length Fig 1\nFigure 1 —Perspective View of the Farm Shop, Garage and Implement Shed The doors to the right are nearly 12 feet high to let in a grain separator over\nnight, or during the winter, or a load of hay in case of a sudden storm Fig 2\nFigure 2 —Floor Plan of Shop, Garage and Storage The building is 60 feet\nwide and 24 feet from front to back The doors of the garage and tool shed are\nmade to open full width, but 8 feet is wide enough for the shop door All doors\nopen out against posts and are fastened to prevent blowing shut The work\nshop is well lighted and the stationary tools are carefully placed for\nconvenience in doing repair work of all kinds The pipe vise is at the doorway\nbetween the shop and garage so the handles of the pipe tools may swing\nthrough the doorway and the pipe may lie full length along the narrow pipe\nbench The doorways provide headroom sufficient for the highest machines,\nand the width when the double doors are opened and the center post\nremoved is nearly twenty feet, which is sufficient for a binder in field\ncondition or a two-horse spring-tooth rake One end of the building looking toward the house is intended for a\nmachine shop to be partitioned off by enclosing the first bent This\ngives a room twenty feet wide by twenty-four feet deep for a\nblacksmith shop and general repair work The next twenty feet is the\ngarage The machine shop part of the building will be arranged\naccording to the mechanical inclination of the farmer Fig 3\nFigure 3 —Perspective View of Farm Implement Shed and Workshop A real farm repair shop is a rather elaborate mechanical proposition There is a good brick chimney with a hood to carry off the smoke and\ngases from the blacksmith fire and the chimney should have a\nseparate flue for a heating stove Farm repair work is done mostly\nduring the winter months when a fire in the shop is necessary for\ncomfort and efficiency A person cannot work to advantage with cold\nfingers Paint requires moderate heat to work to advantage Painting\nfarm implements is a very important part of repair work A good shop arrangement is to have an iron workbench across the\nshop window in the front or entrance end of the building In the far\ncorner against the back wall is a good place for a woodworking bench It is too mussy to have the blacksmith work and the carpenter work\nmixed up",
    "It is too mussy to have the blacksmith work and the carpenter work\nmixed up Fig 4\nFigure 4 —Floor Plan of Farm Implement Shed, showing the workshop in one\nend of the building, handy to the implement storage room Sometimes it is necessary to bring in a pair of horses for shoeing, or to\npull the shoes off For this reason, a tie rail bolted to the studding on\nthe side of the shop near the entrance is an extra convenience In a hot climate a sliding door is preferable because the wind will not\nslam it shut In cold climates, hinge doors are better with a good sill\nand threshold to shut against to keep out the cold Sometimes the\nlarge door contains a small door big enough to step through, but not\nlarge enough to admit much cold, when it is being opened and shut Likewise a ceiling is needed in a cold country, while in warmer\nsections, a roof is sufficient Farm shops, like other farm buildings,\nshould conform to the climate, as well as convenience in doing the\nwork A solid concrete floor is a great comfort And it is easily kept\nclean The perspective and floor plan show the arrangement of the doors,\nwindows and chimney and the placing of the work benches, forge,\nanvil, toolbench and drill press Figures 3 and 4 show the perspective and floor plan of a farm shop\nand implement house 40 x 16 feet in size, which is large enough for\nsome farms SHOP TOOLS\nGood tools are more important on a farm than in a city workshop for\nthe reason that a greater variety of work is required Measuring Mechanical Work —In using tools on the farm the first rule\nshould be accuracy It is just as easy to work to one-sixteenth of an\ninch as to carelessly lay off a piece of work so that the pieces won’t go\ntogether right",

    "Carpenter tools on a\nfarm are not numerous, but they should have a regular place, and\nlaborers on the farms should be encouraged to keep the tools where\nthey belong Fig 11\nFigure 11 —Monkey-Wrenches are the handiest of all farm wrenches, but they\nwere never intended to hammer with Two sizes are needed—an eight-inch for\nsmall nuts and a much larger wrench, to open two inches or more, to use when\ntaking the disks off the shafts of a disk harrow A large pipe-wrench to hold the\nround shaft makes a good companion tool for this work WOODWORKING TOOLS\nEvery farmer has an axe or two, some sort of a handsaw and a nail\nhammer It is astonishing what jobs of repair work a handy farmer\nwill do with such a dearth of tools But it is not necessary to worry\nalong without a good repair kit Tools are cheap enough Such woodworking tools as coarse and fine toothed hand saws, a good\n\n\nsquare, a splendid assortment of hammers and the different kinds of\nwrenches, screw clamps, boring tools—in fact a complete assortment\nof handy woodworking tools is an absolute necessity on a well-\nmanaged farm The farm kit should contain two sizes of nail hammers, see Figure 15,\none suitable to drive small nails, say up to eight penny, and the other\nfor large nails and spikes; a long thin-bladed handsaw, having nine\nteeth to the inch, for sawing boards and planks; a shorter handsaw,\nhaving ten teeth to the inch, for small work and for pruning trees A\npruning saw should cut a fine, smooth kerf, so the wound will not\ncollect and hold moisture Fig 12\nFigure 12 —Hand Saw This pattern, both for cross cut and rip saw, has been\nadopted by all makers of fine saws Nine teeth to the inch is fine enough for\nmost jobs on the farm Fig 13\nFigure 13 —Keyhole Saw with point slim enough to start the cut from a half-\ninch auger hole Fig 14\nFigure 14 —Bramble Hook for trimming berry bushes and cleaning out fence\ncorners It has a knife-edge with hooked sawteeth Farmers’ handsaws are required to do a great many different kinds of\nwork For this reason, it is difficult to keep them in good working\ncondition, but if both saws are jointed, set and filed by a good\nmechanic once or twice a year, they may be kept in usable condition\nthe rest of the time by a handy farm workman, unless extra building\nor special work is required Fig 15\nFigure 15 —Nail Hammers Two styles The upper hammer\nmade with a ball peen and a round face It is tempered\ndrive small nails without slipping and shaped to avoid ding\nthe wood This hammer should weigh 18 or 19 ounc\nincluding the handle The lower hammer is heavier, has a f\nface and is intended for heavy work such as driving spikes a\nfence staples A long-bladed ripsaw is also very useful, and what is commonly\ntermed a keyhole saw finds more use on the farm than in a carpenter’s\n\n\nshop in town It is necessary frequently to cut holes through\npartitions, floors, etc , and at such times a keyhole saw works in just\nright Handaxes are necessary for roughing certain pieces of wood for repair\njobs Two sizes of handaxes for different kinds of work are very useful,\nalso a wide blade draw shave, Figure 16, and shave horse, Figure 9 A\nsteel square having one 24-inch blade and one 18-inch is the best size Such squares usually are heavy enough to remain square after falling\noff the bench forty or fifty times A good deal depends upon the\nquality of the steel Fig 16\nFigure 16 —Drawing-Knife with wide blade for finishing\nstraight surfaces Fig 17\nFigure 17 —Try-Square With Six-Inch Blade Wood, brass and steel are the\nproper materials for a try-square A double marking gauge for scribing mortises\nis also shown Steel squares differ in the measuring marks, but the kind to buy has\none side spaced to sixteenths and the other side to tenths or twelfths The sixteenth interest farmers generally, so that special attention\nshould be given this side of the square The lumber rule on some\nsquares is useful, but the brace rules and mitre calculations are not\nlikely to interest farmers Screw-drivers should be mostly strong and heavy for farm work Three sizes of handled screw-drivers of different lengths and sizes,\nalso two or three brace bit screw-drivers are needed One or two bits\nmay be broken or twisted so the assortment is sometimes exhausted\nbefore the screw is started Fig 18\nFigure 18 —Heavy Hand Axe for Use on the Shop Chopping Block A beet\ntopping knife is shown also Fig 19\n\n\nFigure 19 —Heavy Screwdriver The strongest and cheapest screwdriver is\nmade from a single bar of steel The wooden handle is made in two parts and\nriveted as shown Pinch bars and claw bars are very useful in a farm tool kit Farm\nmechanical work consists principally in repairing implements,\nmachinery, fences and buildings Always a worn or broken part must\nbe removed before the repair can be made A pinch bar twenty-four\ninches long, Figure 21, with a cold chisel end, and another bar\neighteen inches long with a crooked claw end, Figure 22, for pulling\nnails and spikes comes in very handy These two bars should be made\nof the best octagon steel, seven-eighths of an inch in diameter Fig 20\nFigure 20 —(1) Ratchet Screwdriver It does rapid work and will last a\ngeneration if carefully used (2) Auger-Bit of the Side Cutter Type A full set is\nneeded They are not for boring into old wood Running once against a nail\nruins one of these bits",

    "An overhead supply of water leaks away\nand no damage is done Grindstone frames are best made of wood 3″ x 4″ thoroughly mortised\ntogether and well braced with wooden braces and tied across with\nplenty of iron rods A good grindstone frame could be made of angle\niron, but manufacturers generally fail in the attempt There are good ball-bearing grindstone hangers on the market, both\nfor hand crank stones and for belt use The belt is less in the way if it is brought up from below This is not\ndifficult to do A grindstone turns slower than any other farm machine\nso a speed reducing jack may be bolted to the floor at the back of the\ngrindstone a little to one side to escape the drip This arrangement\nrequires a short belt but it may have the full face width of the pulley\nas the tight and loose pulleys are on the jack shaft Emery Grinders —There are small emery wheels made for grinding\ndisks that work quickly and cut an even bevel all around They are\nmade in pairs and are attached to the ends of a mandrel supported by\na metal stand which is bolted to a bench The same rig is used for\nsickle grinding and other farm jobs Fig 36\nFigure 36 —Emery Grinder The illustrations show two kinds of grinding that\ndouble emery wheels are especially adapted to To grind a mowing-machine\nknife it is necessary to reverse By placing the rest opposite the center between\n\n\nthe two wheels the bevel will be the same on both sides, or edges, of the\nsection BLACKSMITH SHOP\nThe furniture in a blacksmith shop consists of forge, anvil, half barrel,\nvise bench, drill press and tool rack A farm shop also has a heating\nstove, shave horse, a woodworking bench, a good power driven\ngrindstone and a double emery grinder Forge —The old-fashioned forge laid up with brick in connection with\nan old-fashioned chimney is just as popular as ever The same old\ntuyer iron receives the air blast from the same old style leather\nbellows, and there is nothing more satisfactory But there are modern\nportable forges, Figure 37, made of iron, that are less artistic, cheaper,\ntake up less room and answer the purpose just about as well The\nportable iron forge has a small blower attached to the frame which\nfeeds oxygen into the fire There are a good many different sizes of\nportable forges Most of them work well up to their advertised\ncapacity Fig 37\nFigure 37",

can be twisted off\nover the riveting, but a great many bolts have round heads and very\nshort, square shanks Theoretically, the shanks are driven into the\nwood firm enough to prevent the bolts from turning Practically this\ntheory is a delusion and a snare, as every farm boy can testify Bolts are not manufactured in quantities in the farm blacksmith shop They can be made by machinery cheaper, but so many times a bolt is\nneeded on short notice that the farm shop should have the necessary\ntools and materials to supply the need quickly Forging Iron and Steel —Iron and steel are composed of the same\nproperties, but differ chemically Steel also is finer grained than iron\nand it requires different treatment Iron should be forged at a light-red\nor white heat If forged at a dark-red heat the iron generally will\ngranulate or crack open and weaken the metal For a smooth finish\nthe last forging may be done at a dark-red heat, but the hammer must\nbe used lightly The weight of the hammer as well as the blows also\nmust differ with the different size of iron under heat Small sizes\nshould be treated with hammer blows that are rather light, while for\nlarge sizes the blows should be correspondingly heavy If light blows\nbe given with a light hammer in forging heavy iron the outside alone\nwill be affected, thus causing uneven tension and contrarywise strain\nin the iron Steel should never be heated above a yellow heat If heated to a white\nheat the steel will be burned Steel should never be forged at a dark-\nred heat If this is done it will cause considerable strain between the\ninner and outer portions, which may cause it to crack while forging The weight of the hammer and the hammer blows in forging of steel is\nvastly of more importance than in forging iron If the blow or the\nhammer is not heavy enough to exert its force throughout the\nthickness of the steel it will probably crack in the process of\nhardening or tempering If steel be properly forged it will harden\neasily and naturally, but if improperly forged the tempering will be\nvery difficult—probably a failure The quality of a finished tool\ndepends greatly upon the correct heat and proper method used in\nforging and hardening it Making Steel Tools —Steel for tools should first be annealed to even\nthe density and prevent warping This is done by heating it to a dull\ncherry red in a slow fire A charcoal fire for this purpose is best\nbecause it contains no sulphur or other injurious impurities After\nheating the piece of new steel all over as evenly as possible it should\nbe buried several inches deep in powdered charcoal and left to cool This completes the annealing process While working steel into proper\nshape for tools, great care is required to prevent burning It should be\nworked quickly and the process repeated as often as necessary Practice is the only recipe for speed When the tool is shaped as well as possible on the anvil it is then\nfinished with a file by clamping the new tool in the vise, using single\ncut files Bastard files are too rough for tool steel After the tool is\nshaped by cross-filing and draw-filing to make it smooth it is\nsometimes polished by wrapping fine emery cloth around the file Oil\nis used with emery cloth to give the steel a luster finish Tempering is\nthe last process in the making of such tools as cold chisels, drills, dies,\npunches, scratchawls, etc Fig 91\nFigure 91 —Blacksmith Hammers Some smiths use a heavy machinist’s\nhammer But the flat peen is more useful when working around the anvil and\nthe leg vise Tempering Steel Tools —Good judgment is required to get the right\ntemper Good eyesight is needed to catch the color at the exact\ninstant, and quick action to plunge it into the water before it cools too\nmuch Dies are made very hard The color of the steel at dipping time\nshould be a bright straw color Cold chisels will break when being\nused if tempered too hard If cold chisels are to be used for cutting\niron, the color should be violet; if the chisels are for cutting stone,\npurple is the color Drills for boring iron are tempered a dark straw\ncolor at the cutting edge merging back into blue The water in the\ndipping tub should be warm, as steel is likely to check or crack when\nit is tempered in cold water Tool steel should be held in a perpendicular position when it enters\n\n\nthe water to cool all sides alike Otherwise the new tool might warp It is better to dip slowly, sometimes holding the point, or cutting edge,\nin the water while permitting the shank to cool slowly enough to\nremain soft Some sizes of steel may be tempered too hard at first and\nthe temper immediately drawn by permitting the heat of the shank to\nfollow down almost to the edge, then dip This is done quickly while\nwatching the colors as they move towards the point or edge Draw-filing —Making \nsix-sided \nand \neight-sided \npunches \nand\nscratchawls out of hexagon and octagon tool steel is interesting work The steel is cut to length by filing a crease all around with a three-\ncornered file When it is sufficiently notched, the steel will break\nstraight across To shape the

    "Special attention must be given to\nthe numerous corners A scratchawl or small punch, must be heated\nmany times and hammered quickly before cooling An old English\nshop adage reads: “Only one blacksmith ever went to the devil and\nthat was for pounding cold iron ”\nAfter the punch or scratchawl is roughed out on the anvil, it is\nfastened in the vise and finished by cross-filing and draw-filing Copper caps on the vise jaws will prevent indentations Copper caps on the vise jaws will prevent indentations Fig 92\nFigure 92 —Vise Jaw Guards Soft auxiliary vise jaws are made of sheet copper\nor galvanized iron Fig 93\nFigure 93 —Roll Filing To file a piece of steel round it is rolled by one hand\nwhile the file is used by the other hand Draw-filing means grasping each end of the file and moving it back\nand forth sidewise along the work For this purpose single-cut files are\nused The smoothing is done with a very fine single-cut file, or if very\nparticular, a float file is used Then the polish is rubbed on with fine\nemery cloth and oil The emery cloth is wrapped around the file and\nthe same motion is continued With some little practice a very\ncreditable piece of work may be turned out Such work is valuable\n\n\nbecause of the instruction A good test of skill at blacksmithing is\nmaking an octagon punch that tapers true to the eye when finished Set-Screws —It is customary to fasten a good many gear wheels, cranks\nand pulleys to machinery shafts by set-screws There are two kinds of\nset-screws; one has a cone point, the other a cup end Both screws are\nhardened to sink into the shaft A cup is supposed to cut a ring and\nthe point is supposed to sink into the shaft to make a small hole\nsufficient to keep the wheel from slipping However, unless the cone-\npointed screw is countersunk into the shaft, it will not hold much of a\nstrain The point is so small it will slip and cut a groove around the\nshaft To prevent this, the set-screw may be countersunk by first\nmarking the shaft with an indentation of the point of the screw Then\nthe wheel or crank or collar may be removed and a hole drilled into\nthe shaft with a twist-drill the same size, or a sixty-fourth smaller,\nthan the set-screw Then by forcing the end of the set-screw into the\ndrill hole, the wheel is held solid",
    "Then by forcing the end of the set-screw into the\ndrill hole, the wheel is held solid Fig 94\nFigure 94 —Machine-Bolt and Set-Screw The bolt to the left is used to clamp\ncylinder heads in place The set-screw to the right is the cup variety The end is\ncountersunk to form a cup with a sharp rim The principal objection to set-screws is that they are dangerous The\nheads always project and are ready to catch a coat sleeve when the\nshaft is revolving In all cases, set-screws should be as large as the hub\nwill allow, and it is better to have them protected so it is impossible\nto catch anything to wind around the shaft Cup set-screws are not\nsatisfactory except for very light work If necessary to use them, the\nends may be firmly fixed by cutting a ring with a sharp, diamond-\npoint cold chisel Setting the Handsaw —Nine teeth to the inch is the most satisfactory\nhandsaw for all kinds of lumber Setting the teeth of this kind of saw\nis best done with a hand lever set The plunger pin should be carefully\nadjusted to bend the teeth just far enough to give the necessary set For general work a saw needs more set than is needed for kiln-dried\nstuff The teeth should cut a kerf just wide enough to clear the blade Anything more is a waste of time and muscle Anything more is a waste of time and muscle It is better to work from\n\n\nboth sides of the saw by first setting one side the whole length of the\nblade Then reverse the saw in the clamp and set the alternate teeth in\nthe same manner There should be a good solid stop between the\nhandles of the set to insure equal pressure against each sawtooth The\npin should be carefully placed against each tooth at exactly the same\nspot every time and the pressure should be the same for each tooth The best saw-sets for fine tooth saws are automatic so far as it is\npossible to make them so, but the skill of the operator determines the\nquality of the work The reason for setting a saw before jointing is to\nleave the flattened ends of the teeth square with the blade after the\njointing and filing is completed Jointing a Handsaw —After the saw has been set it must be jointed to\nsquare the teeth and to even them to equal length, and to keep the\nsaw straight on the cutting edge Some woodworkers give their saws a\nslight camber, or belly, to correspond with the sway-back The camber\nfacilitates cutting to the bottom in mitre-box work without sawing\ninto the bed piece of the box It also throws the greatest weight of the\nthrust upon the middle teeth A saw with even teeth cuts smoother,\nruns truer and works faster than a saw filed by guess It is easy to file\na saw when all of the teeth are the same length and all have the same\nset Anyone can do a good job of filing if the saw is made right to\nbegin with, but no one can put a saw in good working order with a\nthree-cornered file as his only tool",
    "Anyone can do a good job of filing if the saw is made right to\nbegin with, but no one can put a saw in good working order with a\nthree-cornered file as his only tool Fig 95\nFigure 95 —Saw Jointer The wooden block is about two inches square by 12″\nor 14″ in length The block is made true and scribed carefully to have the\nripsaw slot square, straight and true The file is set into a mortise square with\nthe block Filing the Handsaw —First comes the three-cornered file It should be\njust large enough to do the work There is no economy in buying\nlarger files thinking that each of the three corners will answer the\nsame purpose as a whole file of smaller size In the first place the\nsmall file is better controlled and will do better work In the second\nplace the three corners are needed to gum the bottoms of the divisions\nbetween the teeth There is much more wear on the corners than on\nthe sides of a saw-file Also the corners of a small file are more acute,\n\n\nwhich means a good deal in the shape of the finished teeth After the saw is carefully set and jointed, clamp it in the saw vise and\nfile one side of the saw from heel to point Then reverse the saw in the\nsaw clamp and file the other side, being careful to keep the bevel of\neach tooth the same It is better to stop filing just before the tooth\ncomes to a point A triangular or diamond shaped point will cut faster\nand leave a smoother saw kerf and last longer than a needle point As the tooth of a crosscut saw is filed away from both edges, it is\nnecessary to make allowances when filing the first side, otherwise\nsome of the teeth will come to a sharp point before the gumming is\ndeep enough Using a Handsaw —Anyone can saw a board square both up and down\nand crossways by following a few simple rules Have the board\nsupported on the level by two well made saw-benches 24″ high Stand\nup straight as possible and look down on both sides of the saw blade Use long even strokes and let the saw play lightly and evenly through\nthe saw cut Do not cut the mark out; cut to it on the waste end, or further end, if\nthere are more pieces to be cut from the board The saw kerf is about\n3⁄32″ wide for a nine-tooth saw set for unkilned lumber or dimension\nstuff If both saw kerfs are taken from one piece and none from the\nnext then one length will be 3⁄16″ shorter than the other For practice it is a good plan to make two marks 3⁄32″ apart and cut\nbetween them Use a sharp-pointed scratchawl to make the marks A\npenknife blade is next best, but it must be held flat against the blade\nof the square, otherwise it will crowd in or run off at a tangent Setting a Circular Saw —A good saw-set for a circular saw may be\nmade out of an old worn-out flat file Heat the file in the forge fire to\ndraw the temper and anneal it by covering it with ashes Smooth it on\nthe grindstone Put it in the vise and file a notch in one edge The\nnotch should be just wide enough to fit loosely over the point of a\nsawtooth The notch should be just deep enough to reach down one-\nquarter of the length of the tooth Make a saw-set gauge out of a piece of flat iron or steel one inch wide\nand about four inches long File a notch into and parallel to one edge\nat one corner, about one-sixteenth of an inch deep from the edge and\n\n\nabout half an inch long measuring from the end With the home-made\nsaw-set bend the saw teeth outward until the points just miss the iron\ngauge in the corner notch The edges of the gauge should be straight\nand parallel and the notch should be parallel with the edge In use the\nedge of the gauge is laid against the side of the saw so the projecting\ntooth reaches into the notch One-sixteenth of an inch may be too\nmuch set for a small saw but it won’t be too much for a 24-inch wood\nsaw working in green cord wood Jointing a Circular Saw —Run the saw at full speed Lay a 14-inch file\nflat on the top of the saw table at right angles to the saw Move the\nfile slowly and carefully towards the saw until it ticks against the\nteeth Hold the file firmly by both ends until each sawtooth ticks\nlightly against the file A saw in good working order needs very little\njointing, but it should have attention every time the saw is set and it\nshould be done after setting and before filing Filing a Circular Saw —The teeth of a crosscut circular saw point a\nlittle ahead Sometimes they point so nearly straight out from the\ncenter that you have to look twice to determine which way the saw\nshould run There are plenty of rules for the pitch of sawteeth, but\nthey are subject to many qualifications What interests a farmer is a\nsaw that will cut green poles and crooked limbs into stove lengths\nwith the least possible delay A saw 20 inches in diameter will cut a\nstick eight inches through without turning it to finish the cut The\nfront or cutting edges of the teeth of a 24-inch crosscut circular saw\nfor wood sawing should line to a point a little back from the center This may not sound definite enough for best results, so the more\nparticular farmers may use a straight edge Select a straight stick\nabout half an inch square Rest it on top of or against the back of the\nsaw mandrel and shape the forward edges of the teeth on a line with\nthe upper side or rear side of the straight edge The teeth will stand at\nthe proper pitch when the saw is new, if it was designed for sawing\ngreen wood If it works right before being filed, then the width of the\nstraight edge may be made to conform to the original pitch and kept\nfor future use The gumming is done with the edge of the file while filing the front\nedges of the teeth It is finished with the flat side of the file while\nfiling the rear edges of the teeth The depth, or length, of the teeth\nshould be kept the same as the manufacturer designed them A wood\n\n\nsaw works best when the front edges of the teeth have but little bevel The back edges should have more slant The teeth should have three-\ncornered or diamond-shaped points Needle points break off when\nthey come against knots or cross-grained hardwood Short teeth do no\ncutting Single cut flat files are used for circular saws The file should\nfit the saw It should be about 1⁄8″ wider than the length of the front\nside of the teeth The back edges require that the file shall have some\nplay to show part of the tooth while the file is in motion Large files\nare clumsy The file should be carefully selected Fig 96\nFigure 96 —How to Sharpen a Hoe Grinding a hoe is difficult, but filing it\nsharp and straight at the cutting edge is easy If the hoe chatters when held in\nthe vise, spring a wooden block under the blade Use false vise jaws to prevent\ndinging the shank How to Sharpen a Hoe —It is quicker and more satisfactory to file a\nhoe sharp than to grind it on the grindstone The shank of the hoe\nmust be held firmly in the vise and there should be a solid block of\nwood under the blade of the hoe, a little back from the edge; to keep\nthe file from chattering A single cut flat file is the best to use It\nshould be long enough to be easily held in one position to make a\nsmooth, even bevel at the same angle to the face of the blade all the\nway across To make sure not to file a feather edge it is better to joint\nthe hoe to begin with, then to stop filing just before reaching the\nedge If the edge be left 1⁄64″ thick it will wear longer and work more\neasily after having been used an hour or two than it will if the edge be\nfiled thin This is especially noticeable when the ground contains\nsmall stones Hoes are sharpened from the under side only The inside\nof a hoe blade should be straight clear to the edge Hoes should\nalways have sharp corners When working around valuable plants you\nwant to know exactly where the corner of the hoe is when the blade is\nburied out of sight in the ground Shoeing Farm Horses —Farmers have no time or inclination to make a\nbusiness of shoeing horses, but there are occasions when it is\nnecessary to pull a shoe or set a shoe and to do it quickly Shoeing\ntools are not numerous or expensive They consist first of a tool box,\nwith a stiff iron handle made in the shape of a bale The box contains\na shoeing hammer, hoof rasp, hoof knife, or paring-knife, as it is\nusually called, and two sizes of horseshoe-nails Sometimes a foot\npedestal is used to set the horse’s front foot on when the horse wants\nto bear down too hard, but this pedestal is not necessary in the farm\nshop There are flat-footed horses that cannot work even in summer without\nshoes Common sense and shoeing tools are the only requirements\nnecessary to tack on a plate without calks Shoes to fit any foot may\nbe purchased at so much a pound A paring-knife is used to level the bottom of the hoof so that it will\nhave an even bearing on the shoe all the way round It is not desirable\nto pare the frog or the braces in the bottom of a horse’s foot If the\nfoot is well cupped, a little of the horny rim may be taken off near the\nedges Generally it is necessary to shorten the toe This is done partly\nwith the hoof chisel and rasp after the shoe is nailed fast Sometimes\none-fourth of an inch is sufficient; at other times a horse’s hoof is very\nmuch improved by taking off one-half inch or more of the toe growth\neither from the bottom or the front or both Like all other mechanical work the shoeing of a horse’s foot should be\nstudied and planned before starting A long toe is a bad leverage to\novercome when pulling a heavy load At the same time, nature\nintended that a horse should have considerable toe length as a\nprotection to the more tender parts of the foot And the pastern bone\nshould play at the proper angle Fig 97\nFigure 97 —Tool Box for Field Use The long open side is for tools On the\nother side of the center partition bolts, keys, screws, nails, bits of wire, leather,\ntin, etc , are kept in the different divisions",

plowing match held at Wheatland, Illinois, two\ninteresting facts were brought out Boys are not competing for furrow\nprizes and the walking plow has gone out of fashion The plowing at\nthe Wheatland plowing match was done by men with riding plows Only one boy under eighteen years was ready to measure his ability\nagainst competition The attendance of farmers and visitors numbered\nabout three thousand, which shows that general interest in the old-\nfashioned plowing match is as keen as ever A jumbo tractor on the\ngrounds proved its ability to draw a big crowd and eighteen plows at\nthe same time It did its work well and without vulgar ostentation Lack of sufficient land to keep it busy was the tractor’s only\ndisappointment, but it reached out a strong right arm and harrowed\nthe furrows down fine, just to show that it “wasn’t mad at nobody ”\nFig 101\nFigure 101 —Well Sweep The length of the sweep is sufficie\nlower the bucket into the water and to raise it to the coping

products It may be profitable also in preventing waste by\nworking up cheap materials into valuable by-products The modern,\nwell-managed farm is a factory and it should be managed along\nprogressive factory methods In a good dairy stable hay, straw, grains\nand other feeds are manufactured into high-priced cream and butter Fig 102\nFigure 102 —Wire Stretcher A small block and tackle will stretch

make a\nprofit growing and selling grain Grain may sell for more than the\nlabor and seed, but it takes so much vitality from the land that\ndepreciation of capital often is greater than the margin of apparent\nprofit When grains are grown and fed to live-stock on the farm,\nbusiness methods demand better buildings and more power, which\nmeans that the farmer is employing auxiliary machinery and other\nmodern methods to enhance values In other manufacturing establishments raw material is worked over\ninto commercial products which bring several times the amount of\nmoney paid for the raw material Fig 104\nFigure 104 —Farm Hoists Two styles of farm elevating hoists are shown in this\nillustration Two very different lifting jobs are also shown The principle is the same on the farm except that when a farmer raises\nthe raw material he sells it to himself at a profit When he feeds it to\nlive-stock and sells the live-stock he makes another profit When the\nmanure is properly handled and returned to the soil he is making\nanother profit on a by-product Farming carried on in this way is a complicated business which\nrequires superior knowledge of business methods and principles In\norder to conduct the business of farming profitably the labor problem\nhas to be met Good farm help is expensive Poor farm help is more\nexpensive While farm machinery also is expensive, it is cheaper than\nhand labor when the farmer has sufficient work to justify the outlay It is tiresome to have agricultural writers ding at us about the superior\nacre returns of German farms German hand-made returns may be\ngreater per acre, but one American farmhand, by the use of proper\nmachinery, will produce more food than a whole German family Fig 105\nFigure 105 —Two Powerful

dairy\ncattle, but he can be made to earn his salt at churning time All\nmechanism in connection with dog power must be light It also is\nnecessary to eliminate the friction as much as possible Fig 106\nFigure 106 —Dog Churn Power",
    "—Dog Churn Power A wheel keyed to an iron shaft is placed at an\nangle as shown The weight of the dog turns the wheel and power is conveyed\nto the churn by a light rope belt It is necessary to confine the dog between\nstationary partitions built like a stall over the wheel The best way to make a dog power is to use a light wooden sulky\nwheel for the revolving turn table Next best to the sulky wheel is a\nlight buggy wheel The wheel is made fast to an upright iron shaft\nthat is stepped into an iron oil well at the bottom and inclined at an\nangle of about fifteen degrees to give the necessary power To steady\nthe top of the shaft a light boxing is used, preferably a ball-bearing\nbicycle race to reduce friction Power is conveyed to the churn by\nmeans of a grooved pulley on the top of the shaft A small, soft rope\nor heavy string belt runs from this pulley to a similar pulley connected\nwith the churn Dogs learn to like the work when fed immediately after the churning\nis finished Dogs have been known to get on to the power wheel to\ncall attention to their hungry condition This calls to mind the\nnecessity of arranging a brake to stop the wheel to let the dog off When the wheel is running light, the dog cannot let go A spring brake to wear against the iron tire of the wheel is the most\nsatisfactory The brake may be tripped and set against the tire\n\n\nautomatically by a small lever and weight attached to the underside\nof the wheel When the speed is too fast the weight swings out and\nsets the brake When the speed slackens the weight drops back\ntowards the center and releases the brake When the speed is about\nright the weight swings between the two spring catches BULL TREADMILL\nOn dairy farms it is common to see a valuable pure bred bull working\na treadmill for exercise and to pump water Sometimes he turns the\ncream-separator, but the motion is too unsteady for good results Treadmills for this purpose are very simple The mechanism turns a\ngrooved pulley which propels a rope power conveyor The rope belt\nmay be carried across the yards in any direction and to almost any\ndistance Bull treadmills consist of a framework of wood which carries\nan endless apron supported on rollers The apron link chains pass\naround and turn two drumhead sprocket-wheels at the upper end and\nan idler drum at the lower end The sprocket-wheel drum shaft is\ngeared to an auxiliary shaft which carries a grooved pulley A rope\nbelt power conveyor runs in this groove and carries power from the\nbull pen to the pump Bull tread powers usually have smooth inclined lags, because a bull’s\nsteps on the tread power are naturally uneven and irregular This\nconstruction gives an even straight tread to the travel surface To\nprevent slipping, soft wooden strips are nailed onto the lags at the\nlower edges Even incline tread blocks or lags are also recommended\nfor horses that are not shod and for all animals with split hoofs The\ntraveling apron of the power is placed on an incline and the treads are\ncarried around the two drums at the upper and lower ends of the\nframe by means of endless chains There is a governor attachment\nwhich regulates the speed and prevents the machinery from “running\naway ”\nFig 107\nFigure 107 —Bull Tread Power Treadmills have gone out of fashion Too\nmuch friction was the cause, but a mill like this is valuable to exercise a pure\nbred bull Some dairymen make him pump water The simplest governor is made on the two-ball governor principle\nwith weights on opposite levers The governor is attached to two\nopposite spokes in the flywheel As the speed increases the weights\nmove outward because of their centrifugal force This motion operates\na brake lever to retard or stop the flywheel When the machine stops\nan opposite weight rests against the flywheel until it starts in motion\nagain, so the apron cannot be moved until the brake is released This\nis necessary to get the animal on or off of the platform while it is at\nrest to avoid accidents The usual incline is a rise of two feet in eight\nwhen power is wanted This pitch compels the bull to lift one-quarter\nof his own weight and it may be too severe for a heavy animal The\nendless apron is an endless hill climb to the bull Treadmills are not\neconomical of power because there are so many bearings to generate\nfriction WINDMILLS\nWind power is the cheapest power we have A windmill properly\nproportioned to its work is a great help, especially when it is attached\nto a good pump for the purpose of lifting water into an elevated tank\nfrom which it is piped under pressure for domestic purposes and for\nwatering live-stock You can have considerable patience with a windmill if you only\ndepend upon it for pumping water, provided you have a tank that will\nhold a week’s supply to be drawn during a dry, hot time when every\nanimal on the farm demands a double allowance of water That is the\ntime when a farmer hates to attach himself to the pump handle for the\npurpose of working up a hickory breeze That also is the time when\nthe wind neglects a fellow A good windmill is useful up to about one-third of its rated capacity,\nwhich is the strongest argument for buying a mill larger than at first\nseems necessary Some men have suffered at some time in their lives\nwith the delusion that they could tinker with a poorly constructed\nwindmill and make it earn its oil They have never waked up to a full\nrealization of their early delusion It is a positive fact that all\nwindmills are not lazy, deceitful nor wholly unreliable When properly\nconstructed, rightly mounted and kept in good repair, they are not\nprone to work in a crazy fashion when the tank is full

    "M would fill this tank to a working pressure of 100\npounds in about 50 minutes One gallon of air will deliver one gallon\nof water at the faucet But the air must have the same pressure as the\nwater, and there must be no friction Thus, one gallon of air under a\nworking pressure of forty-five pounds, will, theoretically, deliver one\ngallon of water to a height of 100 feet But it takes three gallons of\nfree air to make one gallon of compressed air at forty-five pounds\npressure If the lift is 100 feet, then 1,000 gallons of air under a\npressure of forty-five pounds will theoretically deliver 1,000 gallons of\n\n\nwater Practically, the air tank would have to be loaded to a very\nmuch greater pressure to secure the 1,000 gallons of water before\nlosing the elasticity of the compressed air If one thousand gallons of\nwater is needed on the farm every day, then the air pump would have\nto work about one hour each morning This may not be less expensive\nthan pumping the water directly, but it offers the advantage of water\nfresh from the well Pure air pumped into the well tends to keep the\nwater from becoming stale Pure air pumped into the well tends to keep the\nwater from becoming stale Fig 121\nFigure 121 —(1) Single-Gear Pump Jack This type of jack is used for wells\nfrom 20 to 40 feet deep (2) Double-Gear, or Multiple-Gear Pump Jack This is\na rather powerful jack designed for deep wells or for elevating water into a\nhigh water-tank Fig 122\nFigure 122 —Post Pump Jack This arrangement is used in factories when floor\nspace is valuable",

    "The value of irrigation has been demonstrated\nin the West, and the practice is working eastward Fig 126\n\n\nFigure 126 —Centrifugal Pump Setting When used for irrigation, centrifugal\npumps are set as close to the ground water as practical Irrigation is the new handmaiden of prosperity A rainy season is a\nbountiful one Irrigation supplies the bounty without encouraging\ndestructive fungus diseases Where water is abundant within easy\nreach, \npumping \nirrigation \nwater \nis \nthoroughly \npractical Improvements in pumps in recent years have increased their capacity\nand insured much greater reliability A centrifugal pump is\nrecommended for depths down to 75 feet; beyond this depth the\nnecessity of installing more expensive machinery places the business\nof pumping for irrigation on a different plane A centrifugal pump will\nthrow more water with less machinery than any other device, but like\nall other mechanical inventions, it has its limitations In figuring\neconomical pumping, the minimum quantity should be at least 100\ngallons per minute, because time is an object, and irrigation, if done\nat all, should cover an area sufficient to bring substantial returns Centrifugal pumps should be placed near the surface of the water in\nthe well For this reason, a large, dry well is dug down to the level of\nthe water-table and the pump is solidly bolted to a concrete\nfoundation built on the bottom of this well A supply pipe may be\nextended any depth below the pump, but the standing water surface\nin the well should reach within a few feet of the pump The pump and\nsupply must be so well balanced against each other that the pull-down\nfrom pumping will not lower the water-level in the well more than\ntwenty feet below the pump The nearer the ground water is to the\npump the better The water well below the pump may be bored, or a perforated well\npipe may be driven; or several well points may be connected The\nkind of well must depend upon the condition of the earth and the\nnature of the water supply Driven wells are more successful when\nwater is found in a stratum of coarse gravel Before buying irrigation machinery, it is a good plan to test the water\nsupply by temporary means Any good farm pump may be hitched to\na gasoline engine to determine if the water supply is lasting or not Permanent pumping machinery should deliver the water on high\nground A main irrigation ditch may be run across the upper end of\n\n\nthe field This ditch should hold the water high enough so it may be\ntapped at convenient places to run through the corrugations to reach\nthe roots of the plants to be benefited There are different systems of\nirrigation designed to fit different soils Corrugations are the cheapest\nand the most satisfactory when soils are loose enough to permit the\nwater to soak into the soil sideways, as well as to sink down The\nwater should penetrate the soil on both sides of the corrugations for\ndistances of several inches Corrugations should be straight and true\nand just far enough apart so the irrigation water will soak across and\nmeet between Some soils will wash or gully out if the fall is too rapid In such cases it may be necessary to terrace the land by following the\nnatural contour around the ridges so the water may flow gently Where the fall is very slight, that is, where the ground is so nearly\nlevel that it slopes away less than six inches in a hundred feet, it\nbecomes necessary to prepare the land by building checks and borders\nto confine the water for a certain length of time Then it is let out into\nthe next check In the check and border system the check bank on the\nlower side has an opening which is closed during the soaking period\nwith a canvas dam When the canvas is lifted the water flows through\nand fills the next check This system is more expensive, and it requires\nmore knowledge of irrigation to get it started, and it is not likely to\nprove satisfactory in the East For fruits and vegetables, what is known as the furrow system of\nirrigation is the most practical An orchard is irrigated by plowing\nfurrows on each side of each row of trees The water is turned into\nthese furrows and it runs across the orchard like so many little\nrivulets Potatoes are irrigated on the same plan by running water\nthrough between the rows after the potatoes have been ridged by a\ndouble shovel-plow This plan also works well with strawberries After\nthe land is prepared for irrigation, the expense of supplying water to a\nfruit orchard, strawberry patch or potato field is very little compared\nwith the increase in yield In fact, there are seasons when one\nirrigation will save the crop and produce an abundant yield, when\notherwise it would have been almost a total loss Overhead Spray Irrigation —The most satisfactory garden irrigation is\nthe overhead spray system Posts are set ten feet apart in rows 50 feet\napart Water pipes are laid on the tops of the posts and held loosely in\nposition by large staples These water pipes are perforated by drilling\na line of small holes about three feet apart in a straight line along one\n\n\nside of the pipe The holes are tapped and small brass nozzles are\nscrewed in The overhead pipes are connected with standpipes at the\nhighest place, generally at the ends of the rows The pipe-lines are\nloosely coupled to the standpipes to permit them to roll partly around\nto direct the hundreds of spray nozzles as needed",

also the kind of crop\nand weather conditions enter into the problem On sandy land that is\nvery dry where drainage is good, water may be permitted to run in\nthe corrugations for several days until the ground is thoroughly\nsoaked When potatoes are forming, or clover is putting down its big\nroot system, a great deal of water is needed Irrigation sufficient to\nmake two inches of rainfall may be used to advantage for such crops\nunder ordinary farming conditions It is necessary after each irrigation\n\n\nto break the soil crust by cultivation to prevent evaporation This is\njust as important after irrigation as it is after a rain shower Also any\nlittle pockets that hold water must be carefully drained out, otherwise\nthe crop will be injured by standing water We are not supposed to\nhave such pockets on land that has been prepared for irrigation Kind of Crops to Irrigate —Wheat, oats, barley, etc , may be helped\nwith one irrigation from imminent failure to a wealth of production But these rainfall grain crops do not come under the general\nclassification that interests the regular irrigation farmer beyond his\ndiversity plans for producing considerable variety Fruits, roots,\nclover, alfalfa, vegetables and Indian corn are money crops under\nirrigation Certain seed crops yield splendidly when watered An apple\norchard properly cared for and irrigated just at the right time will pay\nfrom five hundred to a thousand dollars per acre Small fruits are just\nas valuable These successes account for the high prices of irrigated\nland In the East and in the great Middle West, valuable crops are cut\nshort or ruined by drouth when the fruit or corn is forming It makes\nno difference how much rain comes along at other times in the year, if\nthe roots cannot find moisture at the critical time, the yield is reduced\noften below the profit of raising and harvesting the crop Strawberry\nblossoms shrivel and die in the blooming when rain fails Irrigation is\nbetter than rain for strawberries Strawberries under irrigation may be\nmade to yield more bushels than potatoes under humid conditions One hundred bushels of strawberries per acre sounds like a fairy tale,\nbut it is possible on rich land under irrigation The cost of pumping for irrigation, where the well and machinery is\nused for no other purpose, must be charged up to the crop The items\nof expense are interest on the first cost of the pumping machinery,\ndepreciation, upkeep and running expenses On Eastern farms,\nhowever, where diversified farming is the business, this expense may\nbe divided among the different lines of work Where live-stock is kept,\nit is necessary to have a good, reliable water supply for the animals A\nreservoir on high ground so water may be piped to the watering\ntroughs and to the house is a great convenience Also the same engine\nthat does the pumping may be used for other work in connection with\nthe farm, so that the irrigation pump engine, instead of lying idle ten\nor eleven months in the year, may be utilized to advantage and made\nto earn its keep Well-water contains many impurities For this reason,\nit is likely to be valuable for crop growing purposes in a wider sense\n\n\nthan merely to supply moisture Well-water contains lime, and lime is\nbeneficial to most soils It has been noticed that crops grow especially\nwell when irrigated from wells",

    "ACETYLENE GAS\nAcetylene lighting plants are intended for country use beyond the\nreach of city gas mains or electric cables Carbide comes in lump form\nin steel drums It is converted into gas by a generator that is fitted\nwith clock work to drop one or more lumps into water as gas is\nneeded to keep up the pressure Acetylene gas is said to be the purest\nof all illuminating gases Experiments in growing delicate plants in\ngreenhouses lighted with acetylene seem to prove this claim to be\ncorrect The light also is bright, clear and powerful The gas is explosive when\nmixed with air and confined, so that precautions are necessary in\nregard to using lanterns or matches near the generators The expense\nof installing an acetylene plant in a farm home has prevented its\ngeneral use WOOD-SAW FRAMES\nThere are a number of makes of saw frames for use on farms, some of\nwhich are very simple, while others are quite elaborate Provision\nusually is made for dropping the end of the stick as it is cut Sometimes carriers are provided to elevate the blocks onto a pile Extension frames to hold both ends of the stick give more or less\ntrouble, because when the stick to be sawed is crooked, it is almost\nimpossible to prevent binding If a saw binds in the kerf, very often\nthe uniform set is pinched out of alignment, and there is some danger\nof buckling the saw, so that for ordinary wood sawing it is better to\nhave the end of the stick project beyond the jig If the saw is sharp\nand has the right set and the right motion, it will cut the stick off\nquickly and run free while the end is dropping to the ground The quickest saw frames oscillate, being supported on legs that are\nhinged to the bottom of the frame Oscillating frames work easier than\nsliding frames Sliding frames are sometimes provided with rollers,\nbut roller frames are not steady enough For cross sawing lumber V-\nshaped grooves are best No matter what the feeding device is, it\nshould always be protected by a hood over the saw The frame should\n\n\nfall back of its own weight, bringing the hood with it, so that the saw\nis always covered except when actually engaged with the stick Saw-\nmandrels vary in diameter and length, but in construction they are\nmuch alike For wood sawing the shaft should be 13⁄8″ or 11⁄2″ in\ndiameter The shaft runs in two babbitted boxes firmly bolted to the\nsaw frame The frame itself should be well made and well braced",
    "The frame itself should be well made and well braced ROOT PULPER\nThere are root pulpers with concave knives which slice roots in such a\nway as to bend the slices and break them into thousands of leafy\nshreds The principle is similar to bending a number of sheets of paper\nso that each sheet will slide past the next one Animals do not chew\nroots when fed in large solid pieces Cattle choke trying to swallow\nthem whole, but they will munch shredded roots with apparent\npatience and evident satisfaction American farmers are shy on roots They do not raise roots in quantities because it requires a good deal of\nhand labor, but roots make a juicy laxative and they are valuable as\nan appetizer and they carry mineral Pulped roots are safe to feed and\nthey offer the best mixing medium for crushed grains and other\nconcentrated foods FEED CRUSHER\nInstead of grinding grain for feeding, we have what is known as a\ncrusher which operates on the roller-mill principle It breaks the\ngrains into flour by crushing instead of grinding It has the advantage\nof doing good work quickly Our feed grinding is done in the two-\nstory corncrib and granary It is one of the odd jobs on the farm that\nevery man likes The grain is fed automatically into the machine by\nmeans of the grain spouts which lead the different kinds of grain\ndown from the overhead bins The elevator buckets carry the crushed\nfeed back to one of the bins or into the bagger In either case it is not\nnecessary to do any lifting for the sacks are carried away on a bag\ntruck We have no use for a scoop shovel except as a sort of big\ndustpan to use with the barn broom STUMP PULLER\n\n\nPulling stumps by machinery is a quick operation compared with the\nold time methods of grubbing, chopping, prying and burning that our\nforefathers had on their hands Modern stump pulling machines are\nsmall affairs compared with the heavy, clumsy things that were used a\nfew years ago Some of the new stump pullers are guaranteed to clear\nan acre a day of ordinary stumpage This, of course, must be a rough\nestimate, because stumps, like other things, vary in numbers, size and\ncondition of soundness Some old stumps may be removed easily\nwhile others hang to the ground with wonderful tenacity There are two profits to follow the removal of stumps from a partially\ncleared field The work already put on the land has in every case cost\nconsiderable labor to get the trees and brush out of the way The land\nis partially unproductive so long as stumps remain For this reason, it\nis impossible to figure on the first cost until the stumps are removed\nto complete the work and to put the land in condition to raise\nmachine made crops When the stumps are removed, the value of the\nland either for selling or for farming purposes is increased at once Whether sold or farmed, the increasing value is maintained by\ncropping the land and securing additional revenue There are different ways of removing stumps, some of which are easy\nwhile others are difficult and expensive One of the easiest ways is to\nbore a two-inch auger hole diagonally down into the stump; then fill\nthe auger hole with coal-oil and let it remain for some weeks to soak\ninto the wood Large stumps may be bored in different directions so\nthe coal-oil will find its way not only through the main part of the\nstumps but down into the roots This treatment requires that the\nstumps should be somewhat dry A stump that is full of sap has no\nroom for coal-oil, but after the sap partially dries out, then coal oil\nwill fill the pores of the wood After the stump is thoroughly saturated\nwith coal-oil, it will burn down to the ground, so that the different\nlarge roots will be separated Sometimes the roots will burn below\nplow depth, but a good heavy pair of horses with a grappling hook\nwill remove the separated roots Fig 130\nFigure 130 —The Oldest Farm Hoist The first invention for elevating a heavy\nobject was a tripod made of three poles tied together at the top with thongs of\nbark or rawhide When hunters were lucky enough to kill a bear, the tripod\nelevator was erected over the carcass with the lower ends of the poles spread\nwell apart to lower the apex The gambrel was inserted under the hamstrings\nand attached to the top of the tripod As the skinning of the animal proceeded\nthe feet of the tripod were moved closer together By the time the head was cut\noff the carcass would swing clear Dynamite often is used to blow stumps to pieces, and the work is not\nconsidered dangerous since the invention of safety devices In some\nsections of the country where firewood is valuable, dynamite has the\nadvantage of saving the wood An expert with dynamite will blow a\nstump to pieces so thoroughly that the different parts are easily\nworked into stove lengths Pitch-pine stumps have a chemical value\nthat was not suspected until some fellows got rich by operating a\nretort FARM ELEVATING MACHINERY\nMany handy and a few heavy elevators are being manufactured to\nreplace human muscle The simple tripod beef gin was familiar to the\nearly settlers and it is still in use When a heavy animal was killed for\nbutchering, the small ends of three poles were tied together to form a\ntripod over the carcass The feet of the tripod were placed wide apart\nto raise the apex only a few feet above the animal After the gambrel\nwas inserted and attached the feet of the tripod were moved gradually\ncloser together as the skinning proceeded, thus elevating the carcass\nto swing clear of the ground Grain Elevators —As a farm labor-saver, machinery to elevate corn\ninto the two-story corncrib and grain into the upper bins is one of the\nnewer and more important farming inventions With a modern two-\nstory corncrib having a driveway through the center, a concrete floor\nand a pit, it is easy to dump a load of grain or ear corn by raising the\nfront end of the wagon box without using a shovel or corn fork After\nthe load is dumped into the pit a boy can drive a horse around in a\ncircle while the buckets carry the corn or small grain and deliver it by\n\n\nspout into the different corncribs or grain bins There are several\nmakes of powerful grain elevating machines that will do the work\neasily and quickly The first requisite is a building with storage overhead, and a\nconvenient place to work the machinery Some of the elevating\nmachines are made portable and some are stationary Some of the\nportable machines will work both ways Usually stationary elevators\nare placed in vertical position Some portable elevators may be\noperated either vertically or on an incline Such machines are\nadaptable to different situations, so the corn may be carried up into\nthe top story of a farm grain warehouse or the apparatus may be\nhauled to the railway station for chuting the grain or ear corn into a\ncar It depends upon the use to be made of the machinery whether the\nstrictly stationary or portable elevator is required To unload usually\nsome kind of pit or incline is needed with any kind of an elevator, so\nthe load may be dumped automatically quickly from the wagon box to\nbe distributed by carrying buckets at leisure Fig 131\nFigure 131 —Portable Grain Elevator Filling a Corncrib The same rig is taken\nto the railway to load box cars The wagon is unloaded by a lifting jack It\ncosts from 1c to 11⁄2c per bushel to shovel corn by hand, but the greatest\nsaving is in time Some elevators are arranged to take grain slowly from under the\ntailboard of a wagon box The tailrod is removed and the tailboard\nraised half an inch or an inch, according to the capacity of the\nmachinery The load pays out through the opening as the front of the\nwagon is gradually raised, so the last grain will discharge into the pit\nor elevator hopper of its own weight Technical building knowledge\nand skill is required to properly connect the building and elevating\nmachinery so that the two will work smoothly together There are\ncertain features about the building that must conform to the\nrequirements and peculiarities of the elevating machinery The grain\nand ear corn are both carried up to a point from which they will\ntravel by gravity to any part of the building The building requires\ngreat structural strength in some places, but the material may be very\nlight in others Hence, the necessity of understanding both building\n\n\nand machinery in order to meet all of the necessary technical\nrequirements CHAPTER V\nWORKING THE SOIL\nIMPORTANCE OF PLOWING\nPlowing is a mechanical operation that deals with physics, chemistry,\nbacteriology and entomology The soil is the farmer’s laboratory; his\nsoil working implements are his mechanical laboratory appliances A\nhigh order of intelligence is required to merge one operation into the\nnext to take full advantage of the assistance offered by nature The\nobject of plowing and cultivation is to improve the mechanical\ncondition of the soil, to retain moisture, to kill insects and to provide\na suitable home for the different kinds of soil bacteria Fig 132\nFigure 132 —Heavy Disk Plow A strong four-horse disk implement for\nbreaking stumpy ground or to tear tough sod into bits before turning under\nwith a moldboard There are aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, also nitrogen-gathering\nbacteria and nitrifying bacteria which are often loosely referred to as\nazotobacter species Few of us are on intimate terms with any of\nthem, but some of us have had formal introductions through\nexperiments and observation Fig 133\nFigure 133 —Sulky Plow This is a popular type of riding plow It is fitted with\na rolling coulter THE MECHANICS OF PLOWING\nWalking Plow —The draft of a walking plow may be increased or\ndiminished by the manner of hitch It is necessary to find the direct\n\n\nline of draft between the work performed and the propelling force The clevis in the two-horse doubletree, or the three-horse evener and\nthe adjusting clevis in the end of the plow-beam with the connecting\nlink will permit a limited adjustment The exact direction that this\nline takes will prove out in question The walking plow should not\nhave a tendency to run either in or out, neither too deep nor too\nshallow For the proper adjustment as to width and depth of furrow,\nthe plow should follow the line of draft in strict obedience to the pull\nso that it will keep to the furrow on level ground a distance of several\nfeet without guidance from the handles In making the adjustment it is\nfirst necessary to see that the plow itself is in good working order All\ncutting edges such as share, coulter or jointer must be reasonably\nsharp and the land slip in condition as the makers intended Fig 134\nFigure 134 —Disk Plow Less power is required to plow with a disk, but it is a\nsort of cut and cover process The disk digs trenches narrow at the bottom There are ridges between the little trenches that are not worked",
    "There are ridges between the little trenches that are not worked Fig 135\nFigure 135 —Three-Horse and Four-Horse Eveners This kind of evener hitches\nthe horses closer to the load than some others and they are easier to handle\nthan the spread out kinds The four-horse rig requires the best horses in the\nmiddle All plows should have a leather pocket on the side of the beam to\ncarry a file A 12-inch bastard file with a good handle is the most\nsatisfactory implement for sharpening the cutting edges of a plow in\nthe fields A good deal depends on the character of the soil and its\ncondition of dryness, but generally speaking, it pays to do a little\nfiling after plowing a half mile of furrow If the horses are doing their\nduty, a little rest at the end of the half mile is well earned The\nplowman can put in the time to advantage with the file and the next\nhalf mile will go along merrily in consequence No farmer would\ncontinue to chop wood all day without whetting his axe, but,\nunfortunately, plowmen often work from morning till night without\nany attempt to keep the cutting edges of their plows in good working\norder Riding Plow —The riding plow in lifting and turning the furrow slice\ndepends a good deal on the wheels The action of the plow is that of a\nwedge with the power pushing the point, the share and the\nmoldboard between the furrow slices and the land side and the furrow\nbottom There is the same friction between the moldboard and the\nfurrow slice as in the case of the walking plow, but the wheels are\nintended to materially reduce the pressure on the furrow bottom and\nagainst the land side Plow wheels are intended to relieve the draft in\nthis respect because wheels roll much easier than the plow bottom can\nslide with the weight of the work on top The track made in the\nbottom of the furrow with the walking plow shows plainly the heavy\npressure of the furrow slice on the moldboard by the mark of the slip To appreciate the weight the slip carries, an interesting experiment\nmay be performed by loading the walking plow with weights\nsufficient to make the same kind of a mark when the plow is not\nturning a furrow One advantage in riding plows in addition to the relief of such a load\nis less packing of the furrow bottom On certain soils when the\nmoisture is just sufficient to make the subsoil sticky, a certain portion\nof the furrow bottom is cemented by plow pressure so that it becomes\nimpervious to the passage of moisture either up or down The track of\na plow wheel is less injurious Fig 136\nFigure 136 —Three-Section, Spike-Tooth Harrow The harrow is made straight,\nbut the hitch is placed over to one side to give each tooth a separate line of\ntravel",

act of plowing To facilitate\nthe process and at the same time turn a wide furrow, the jointer does\nfairly good work when soil conditions are suitable The jointer is a\nlittle plow which takes the place of the coulter and is attached to the\nplow-beam in the same manner The jointer turns a little furrow one\ninch or two inches deep and the large plow following after turns a\ntwelve-inch or fourteen-inch furrow slice flat over, throwing the little\njointer furrow in the middle of the furrow bottom in such a way that\nthe big furrow breaks over the smaller furrow If the work is well done, cracks as wide as a man’s hand and from\nthree to five inches deep are left all over the field These cracks lead\nair and moisture to rot the trash below This is a much quicker way of\ndoing a fairly good job of plowing Such plows loosen the soil and\nfurnish the conditions required by nature; and they may be operated\nwith much less skill than the old-fashioned narrow-furrowed Scotch\nplows Good plowing requires first that the soil be in proper condition to\nplow, neither too dry nor too wet, but no man can do good plowing\nwithout the proper kind of plow to fit the soil he is working with PLOWING BY TRACTOR\nUnder present conditions farm tractors are not intended to replace\nhorse power entirely but to precede horses to smooth the rough places\nthat horses may follow with the lighter machines to add the finishing\n\n\ntouches Light tractors are being made, and they are growing in\npopularity, but the real business of the farm tractor is to do the heavy\nlugging—the work that kills horses and delays seeding until the\ngrowing season has passed The actual power best suited to the\nindividual farm can only be determined by the nature of the land and\nthe kind of farming In the Middle West where diversified farming is practiced, the 8-16\nand the 10-20 sizes seem to be the most satisfactory, and this is\nwithout regard to the size of the farm The preponderance of heavy\nwork will naturally dictate the buying of a tractor heavier than a\n10-20 The amount of stationary work is a factor In certain\ncommunities heavy farm tractors are made to earn dividends by\nrunning threshing machines after harvest, silo fillers in the fall and\nlimestone crushers in the winter Here is a classified list of jobs the medium size farm tractor is good\nfor:\nClearing the Land—pulling up bushes by the roots, tearing out hedges,\npulling stumps, grubbing, pulling stones Preparing Seed Bed and Seeding—plowing, disking, crushing clods,\npulling a land plane, rolling, packing, drilling, harrowing Harvesting—mowing, pulling grain binders, pulling potato digger Belt Work—hay baling, corn shelling, heavy pumping for irrigation,\ngrinding feed, threshing, clover hulling, husking and shredding, silo\nfilling, stone crushing Road Work—grading, dragging, leveling, ditching, hauling crops Miscellaneous—running portable sawmill, stretching wire fencing,\nditch digging, manure spreading Generally speaking, however, the most important farm tractor work is\npreparing the seed-bed thoroughly and quickly while the soil and\nweather conditions are the best And the tractor’s ability to work all\nday and all night at such times is one of its best qualifications To plow one square mile, or 640 acres, with a walking plow turning a\ntwelve-inch furrow, a man and team must walk 5,280 miles The\ngang-plow has always been considered a horse killer, and, when\n\n\nfarmers discovered that they could use oil power to save their horses,\nmany were quick to make the change It requires approximately 10 horsepower hours to turn an acre of land\nwith horses At a speed of two miles, a team with one plow in ten\nhours will turn two acres To deliver the two horsepower required to\ndo this work, they must travel 176 feet per minute and exert a\ncontinuous pull of 375 pounds or 187 5 pounds per horse One horsepower equals a pull of 33,000 pounds, moved one foot per\nminute Two-mile speed equals two times 5,280 or 10,560 feet per\nhour, or 176 feet per minute Sixty-six thousand divided by 176\nequals 375 foot pounds pull per minute One horsepower is absorbed\nin 88 feet of furrow Horse labor costs, according to Government figures, 121⁄2 cents per\nhour per horse On this basis ten hours’ work will be $1 25, which is\nthe average daily cost of each horse An average Illinois diversified\nfarm of 160 acres would be approximately as follows: Fifty acres of\ncorn, 30 acres of oats and wheat, 20 acres of hay, 60 acres of rough\nland, pasture, orchard, building and feed lots This average farm supports six work horses or mules and one colt According to figures taken from farm work reports submitted by many\ndifferent corn belt farmers, the amount of horse-work necessary to do\nthis cropping would figure out as follows:\nFifty acres of corn land for plowing, disking, harrowing, planting,\ncultivating and harvesting would amount to a total of 1,450\nhorsepower hours Thirty acres of wheat would require a total of 330\nhorsepower hours Twenty acres of hay would require 110\nhorsepower hours In round figures, 1,900 horsepower hours at 121⁄2\ncents would amount to $237 50 Elaborate figures have been worked out theoretically to show that this\nwork can be done by an 8-16 farm tractor in 273⁄4 days at a cost for\nkerosene fuel and lubricating oil of $1 89 per day Adding interest,\nrepairs and depreciation, brings this figure up to about $4 00 per day,\nor a total of $111 00 for the job No account is kept of man power in\ncaring for either the horses or the tractor The actual man labor on the\njob, however, figures 121⁄3 days less for the tractor than for horses We should remember that actual farm figures are used for the cost of\n\n\nhorse work Such figures are not available for tractor work The cost of plowing with a traction engine depends upon so many\nfactors that it is difficult to make any definite statement It depends\nupon the condition of the ground, size of the tractor, the number of\nplows pulled, and the amount of fuel used An 8-16 horsepower\ntractor, for instance, burning from 15 to 20 gallons of low grade\nkerosene per ten hour day and using one gallon of lubricating oil,\ncosts about $1 90 per ten hours work Pulling two 14-inch plows and\ntraveling 20 miles per day, the tractor will plow 5 6 acres at a fuel\nand an oil cost of about 30 cents per acre Pulling three 14-inch\nplows, it will turn 8 4 acres at a cost for fuel and oil of about 20 cents\nan acre The kind and condition of soil is an important factor in determining\nthe tractor cost of plowing Comparison between the average horse\ncost and the average tractor cost suggests very interesting possibilities\nin favor of tractor plowing under good management Aside from the actual cost in dollars we should also remember that no\nhorse gang can possibly do the quality of work that can be\naccomplished by an engine gang Anxiety to spare the team has cut a\nbig slice off the profits of many a farmer He has often plowed late on\naccount of hard ground, and he has many times allowed a field to\nremain unplowed on account of worn-out teams Under normal\nconditions, late plowing never produces as good results as early\nplowing Many a farmer has fed and harnessed by the light of the\nlantern, gone to the field and worked his team hard to take advantage\nof the cool of the morning With the approach of the hot hours of\nmidday, the vicious flies sapping the vitality from his faithful team, he\nhas eased up on the work or quit the job In using the tractor for plowing, there are none of these distressing\nconditions to be taken into consideration, nothing to think of but the\nquality of work done It is possible to plow deep without thought of\nthe added burden Deep plowing may or may not be advisable But\nwhere the soil will stand it, deep plowing at the proper time of year,\nand when done with judgment, holds moisture better and provides\nmore plant food The pull power required to plow different soils varies from about\nthree pounds per square inch of furrow for light sand up to twenty\n\n\npounds per square inch of furrow for gumbo The draft of a plow is\ngenerally figured from clover sod, which averages about seven pounds\nper square inch Suppose a plow rig has two 14-inch bottoms, and the\ndepth to be plowed is six inches A cross section of each plow is\ntherefore 14 by 6 inches, or 84 square inches Twice this for two\nbottoms is 168 square inches Since, in sandy soil, the pressure per\nsquare inch is three pounds, therefore 168 times 3 pounds equals 504\npounds, the draft in sandy soil 168 times 7 pounds equals 1,176\npounds, the draft in clover sod 168 times 8 pounds equals 1,344\npounds, the draft in clay sod The success of crop growing depends upon the way the seed-bed is\nprepared The final preparation of the seed-bed can never be\nthoroughly well done unless the ground is properly plowed to begin\nwith It is not sufficient to root the ground over or to crowd it to one\nside but the plow must really turn the furrow slice in a uniform,\nsystematic manner and lay it bottom side uppermost to receive the\nbeneficial action of the air, rain and sunshine The moldboard of a plow must be smooth in order to properly shed\nthe earth freely to make an easy turn-over The shape of the shear and\nthe forward part of the moldboard is primarily that of a wedge, but\nthe roll or upper curve of the moldboard changes according to soil\ntexture and the width and depth of furrow to be turned Moldboards\nalso differ in size and shape, according to the kind of furrow to be\nturned Sometimes in certain soils a narrow solid furrow with a comb\non the upper edge is preferable In other soils a cracked or broken\nfurrow slice works the best When working our lighter soils a wide\nfurrow turned flat over on top of a jointer furrow breaks the ground\ninto fragments with wide cracks or openings reaching several inches\ndown Between these extremes there are many modifications made for\nthe particular type or texture of the soil to be plowed We can observe\nthe effect that a rough, or badly scratched, or poorly shaped\nmoldboard has on any kind of soil, especially when passing from\ngravelly soils to clay In soil that contains the right amount of\nmoisture, when a plow scours all the time, the top of the furrow slice\nalways has a glazed or shiny appearance This shows that the soil is\nslipping off the moldboard easily In places where the plow does not\nscour the ground is pushed to one side and packed or puddled on the\nunderside instead of being lifted and turned as it should be A field\nplowed with a defective moldboard will be full of these places Such\n\n\nground cannot have the life to bring about a satisfactory bacteria\ncondition necessary to promote the rapid plant growth that proper\nplowing gives it Cultivated sandy soils are becoming more acid year after year We are\nusing lime to correct the acidity, but the use of lime requires better\nplowing and better after cultivation to thoroughly mix the trash with\nthe earth to make soil conditions favorable to the different kinds of\nsoil bacteria Unless we pay special attention to the humus content of\nthe soil we are likely to use lime to dissolve out plant foods that are\nnot needed by the present crop, and, therefore, cannot be utilized This is what the old adage means which reads: “Lime enricheth the\nfather but impoverisheth the son ” When that was written the world\nhad no proper tillage tools and the importance of humus was not even\ndreamed of Not so many years ago farm plows were made of cast iron Then came\nthe steel moldboard, which was supposed to be the acme of perfection\nin plow making Steel would scour and turn the furrow in fluffy soils\nwhere cast iron would just root along without turning the ground at\nall Later the art of molding steel was studied and perfected until\nmany grades and degrees of hardness were produced and the shape of\nthe moldboard passed through a thousand changes The idea all the\ntime was to make plows that would not only scour but polish in all\nkinds of soil At the same time they must turn under all of the\nvegetable growth to make humus, to kill weeds and to destroy\ntroublesome insects Besides these requirements the soil must be\npulverized and laid loose to admit both air and moisture These\nexperiments gradually led up to our present high grade plows of\nhardened steel and what is known as chilled steel Besides the hardness there are different shapes designed for different\nsoils so that a plow to work well on one farm may need to be quite\ndifferent from a plow to do the best work in another neighborhood The furrow slice sliding over a perfect moldboard leaves the surface of\nthe upturned ground as even as the bottom of the furrow By using a\nmodern plow carefully selected to fit the soil, gravel, sandy, stony or\nmuck soils, or silt loams that contain silica, lime, iron and aluminum\noxide can be worked with the right plow to do the best work possible\nif we use the necessary care and judgment in making the selection One object of good plowing is to retain moisture in the soil until the\ngrowing crop can make good use of it The ease with which soils absorb, retain or lose moisture, depends\nmostly on their texture, humus content, physical condition, and\nsurface slope or artificial drainage It is to the extent that cultivation\ncan modify these factors that more soil water can be made available\nto the growing crop There are loose, open soils through which water\npercolates as through a sieve, and there are tight, gumbo soils which\nswell when the surface is moistened and become practically\nwaterproof Sandy soils take in water more readily than heavier soils,\nhence less precaution is necessary to prevent run-off Among the thousands of plows of many different makes there are\nplenty of good ones The first consideration in making a selection is a\nreliable home dealer who has a good business reputation and a\nthorough knowledge of local soil from a mechanical standpoint The\nnext consideration is the service the plow will give in proportion to\nthe price DISK HARROW\nFor preparing land to receive the seed no other implement will equal\na double disk These implements are made in various sizes and\nweights of frame For heavy land, where it is necessary to weight the\ndisk down, an extra heavy frame is necessary It would probably be\nadvisable to get the extra strong frame for any kind of land, because\neven in light sand there are times when a disk may be used to\nadvantage to kill quackgrass or to chew up sod before plowing In\nsuch cases it is customary to load on a couple of sacks of sand in\naddition to the weight of the driver When a disk is carrying 300 or\n400 pounds besides its own weight the racking strains which pull\nfrom different directions have a tendency to warp or twist a light\nframe out of shape To keep a disk cultivator in good working order it\nis necessary to go over it thoroughly before doing heavy work Bolts\nmust be kept tight, all braces examined occasionally, and the heavy\nnuts at the ends of the disk shafts watched They sometimes loosen\nand give trouble The greatest difficulty in running a disk harrow or\ncultivator is to keep the boxings in good trim Wooden boxes are\nprovided with the implement It is a good plan to insist on having a\n\n\nfull set of eight extra boxes These wooden boxes may be made on the\nfarm, but it sometimes is difficult to get the right kind of wood They\nshould be made of hard maple, bored according to size of shaft, and\nboiled in a good quality of linseed oil Iron boxings have never been\nsatisfactory on a disk implement Wooden ones make enough trouble,\nbut wood has proved better than iron On most disk cultivators there\nare oil channels leading to the boxings These channels are large\nenough to carry heavy oil The lighter grades of cylinder oil work the\nbest It is difficult to cork these oil channels tight enough to keep the\nsand out Oil and sand do not work well together in a bearing The\nmanufacturers of these implements could improve the oiling device by\nshortening the channel and building a better housing for the oil\nentrance It is quite a job to take a disk apart to put in new boxings,\nbut, like all other repair work, the disk should be taken into the shop,\nthoroughly cleaned, repaired, painted and oiled in the winter time Some double disk cultivators have tongues and some are made\nwithout Whether the farmer wants a tongue or not depends a good\ndeal on the land The only advantage is that a tongue will hold the\ndisk from crowding onto the horses when it is running light along the\nfarm lanes or the sides of the fields with the disks set straight Horses\nhave been ruined by having the sharp disks run against them when\ngoing down hill Such accidents always are avoidable if a man realizes\nthe danger Unfortunately, farm implements are often used by men\nwho do very little thinking A spring disk scraper got twisted on a root\nand was thrown over the top of one of the disks so it scraped against\nthe back of the disk and continued to make a harsh, scraping noise\nuntil the proprietor went to see what was wrong The man driving the\ndisk said he thought something must be the matter with the\ncultivator, but he couldn’t tell for the life of him what it was When\nfarmers are up against such difficulties it is safer to buy a disk with a\ntongue Harrow Cart —A small two-wheel cart with a spring seat\novershadowed with a big umbrella is sometimes called a “dude sulky ”\nMany sensitive farmers trudge along in the soft ground and dust\nbehind their harrows afraid of such old fogy ridicule The hardest and\nmost tiresome and disagreeable job at seeding time is following a\nharrow on foot Riding a harrow cart in the field is conserving energy\nthat may be applied to better purposes after the day’s work in the\nfield is finished KNIFE-EDGE PULVERIZERS\nA knife-edge weeder makes the best dust mulch pulverizer for orchard\nwork or when preparing a seed-bed for grain These implements are\nsold under different names It requires a stretch of imagination to\nattach the word “harrow” to these knife-edge weeders There is a\ncentral bar which is usually a hardwood plank The knives are bolted\nto the underside of the plank and sloped backward and outward from\nthe center to the right and left, so that the knife-edges stand at an\nangle of about 45° to the line of draught This angle is just about\nsufficient to let tough weeds slip off the edges instead of dragging\nalong If the knives are sharp, they will cut tender weeds, but the\ntough ones must be disposed of to prevent choking The proper use of\nthe knife-edge weeder prevents weeds from growing, but in farm\npractice, sometimes rainy weather prevents the use of such a tool\nuntil the weeds are well established As a moisture retainer, these\nknife-edge weeders are superior to almost any other implement They\nare made in widths of from eight to twenty feet The wide ones are\njointed in the middle to fit uneven ground CLOD CRUSHER\nThe farm land drag, float, or clod crusher is useful under certain\nconditions on low spots that do not drain properly Such land must be\nplowed when the main portion of the field is in proper condition, and\nthe result often is that the low spots are so wet that the ground packs\ninto lumps that an ordinary harrow will not break to pieces Such\nlumps roll out between the harrow teeth and remain on top of the\nground to interfere with cultivation The clod crusher then rides over\nthe lumps and grinds them into powder Unfortunately, clod crushers\noften are depended on to remedy faulty work on ordinary land that\nshould receive better treatment Many times the clod crusher is a poor\nremedy for poor tillage on naturally good land that lacks humus Fig 140\nFigure 140 —Land Float Clod crushers and land floats belong to the same\ntribe Theoretically they are all outlaws, but some practical farmers harbor one\nor more of them Wet land, containing considerable clay, sometimes forms into\nlumps which should be crushed As ordinarily made, the land float or clod crusher consists of from five\nto eight planks, two inches thick and ten or twelve inches wide,\nspiked together in sawtooth position, the edges of the planks being\nlapped over each other like clapboards in house siding The planks are\nheld in place with spikes driven through into the crosspieces FARM ROLLER\nFarm rollers are used to firm the soil Sometimes a seed-bed is worked\nup so thoroughly that the ground is made too loose so the soil is too\nopen and porous Seeds to germinate require that the soil grains shall\nfit up closely against them Good soil is impregnated with soil\nmoisture, or film moisture as it is often called, because the moisture\nforms in a film around each little soil grain In properly prepared soil\nthis film moisture comes in contact with the freshly sown seed If the\ntemperature is right the seed swells and germination starts The\nswelling of the seed brings it in contact with more film moisture\nattached to other grains of soil so the rootlet grows and pushes out\ninto the soil in search of moisture on its own account A roller is\nvaluable to press the particles of soil together to bring the freshly\nsown seeds in direct contact with as many particles of soil as possible Rolling land is a peculiar operation, the value of which is not always\nunderstood The original idea was to benefit the soil by breaking the\nlumps It may be of some benefit on certain soils for this purpose, but\nthe land should always be harrowed after rolling to form a dust mulch\nto prevent the evaporation of moisture Land that has been rolled and\nleft overnight shows damp the next morning, which is sufficient proof\nthat moisture is coming to the surface and is being dissipated into the\natmosphere In the so-called humid sections of the country the great\nproblem is to retain moisture Any farm implement that has a\ntendency to dissipate soil moisture is a damage to the farmer Probably nine times out of ten a farm roller is a damage to the crop it\nis intended to benefit because of the manner in which it is used It is\nthe abuse, not the proper use of a roller, that injures the crop Fig 141\nFigure 141 —Iron Land Roller Made of Boiler Plate Fig 142\nFigure 142 —Wooden Land Roller CORN-PLANTER\nCorn-planters are designed to plant two rows at once The width of\nrows may be adjusted from about 32 to 44 inches apart When seed-\ncorn is carefully graded to size the dropping mechanism will feed out\nthe grains of corn regularly with very few skips This is one reason\nwhy most farmers plant corn in drills There are other cultural reasons\nwhich do not properly belong to this mechanical article Hill dropping\nis considerably more complicated and difficult After the feeding\nmechanism has been adjusted to the size of seed kernels to be planted\nso it will drop four kernels in a hill then the trip chain is tried out to\nsee if it is right at every joint Dropping in hills is a very careful\nmechanical proposition An inch or two out of line either way means a\nloss of corn in cultivating In setting the stakes to go and come by, a careful measurement of the\nfield is necessary in order to get the stake lines on both sides of the\nfield parallel If the ring stakes are driven accurately on the line, then\nthe first hill of corn must come at the same distance from the line in\neach row Likewise in starting back from the far side of the field the\nfirst hill should measure exactly the same distance from the stake line\nas the first hills on the opposite side of the field This is easily\nmanaged by counting the number of trips between the stake line and\nthe first row of corn hills If the two lines of stakes on the opposite\nsides of the field are exactly parallel it is not necessary to move either\nline in order to get the proper distance to start dropping, but it must\nbe adjusted by measurement, otherwise the corn hills will be dodged If the corn hills are to space three feet apart then the first row of hills\nshould come nine or twelve feet from the stake line Stakes may be\nmeasured and set a certain number of inches from the line to make\nthe distance come right This careful adjustment brings the hills in\nline in the rows When the field is level or gently sloping there is no difficulty in\nmaking straight rows so far as check rowing is concerned When the\nfield is hilly another problem crops up It is almost impossible to run\n\n\ncorn rows along the side of a hill and keep them straight The planter\nhas a tendency to slide downhill Also the distance across a field is\ngreater where the rows pass over a hill To keep the rows straight\nunder such conditions allowance must be made for the stretch over\nthe hill as well as for the side thrust of the planter Where a chain\nmarker is used it hangs downhill and a further allowance must be\nmade for that A good driver will skip an inch or so above the mark so\nthat the rows will be planted fairly straight This means a good deal\nmore in check rowing than when the corn is planted in drills The\ngreatest objection to hill planting is the crowding of four corn plants\ninto a space that should be occupied by one plant A great many experiments have been tried to scatter the seeds in the\nhill, so far without definite results, except when considerable\nadditional expense is incurred However, a cone suspended below the\nend of the dropping tube usually will scatter the seeds so that no two\nseeds will touch each other They may not drop and scatter four or\nfive inches apart, but these little cones will help a good deal They\nmust be accurately adjusted so the point of the cone will center in the\nmiddle of the vertical delivery tube, and there must be plenty of room\nall around the cone so the corn seed kernels won’t stick The braces\nthat hold the cones in place for the same reason must be turned edge\nup and supported in such a way as to leave plenty of clearance The\nidea is that four kernels of corn drop together They strike the cone\nand are scattered in different directions They naturally fly to the\noutsides of the drill mark which scatters them as wide apart as the\nwidth of the shoe that opens the drill The advantage of scattering\nseed grains in the hill has been shown by accurate experiments\nconducted at different times by agricultural colleges GRAIN DRILL\nTo know exactly how much seed the grain drill is using it is necessary\nto know how many acres are contained in the field Most drills have\nan attachment that is supposed to measure how many acres and\nfractions of acres the drill covers Farmers know how much grain each\nsack contains, so they can estimate as they go along, provided the\ndrill register is correct It is better to provide a check on the drill\nindicator Have the field measured, then drive stakes along one side,\nindicating one acre, five acres and ten acres When the one-acre stake\n\n\nis reached the operator can estimate very closely whether the drill is\nusing more or less seed than the indicator registers When the five-\nacre stake is reached another proof is available, and so on across the\nfield Next in importance to the proper working of the drill is straight\nrows The only way to avoid gaps is to drive straight The only way to\ndrive straight is to sight over the wheel that follows the last drill\nmark Farmers sometimes like to ride on the grain drill, which places\nthe wheel sighting proposition out of the question A harrow cart may\nbe hitched behind the wheel of the grain drill, but it gives a side draft The only way to have straight rows and thorough work is to walk\nbehind the end of the drill This is the proper way to use a drill,\nanyway, because a tooth may clog up any minute Unless the operator\nis walking behind the drill he is not in position to see quickly whether\nevery tooth is working properly or not It is hard work to follow a drill\nall day long, but it pays at harvest time It costs just as much to raise a\ncrop of grain that only covers part of the ground, and it seems too bad\nto miss the highest possible percentage to save a little hard work at\nplanting time SPECIAL CROP MACHINERY\nSpecial crops require special implements After they are provided, the\nequipment must be kept busy in order to make it pay If a farmer\nproduces five acres of potatoes he needs a potato cutter, a planter, a\nriding cultivator, a sprayer that works under high pressure, a digger\nand a sorter The same outfit will answer for forty acres, which would\nreduce the per acre cost considerably No farmer can afford to grow\nfive acres of potatoes without the necessary machinery, because hand\nlabor is out of the question for work of that kind On the right kind of soil, and within reach of the right market,\npotatoes are money-makers But they must be grown every year\nbecause the price of potatoes fluctuates more than any other farm\ncrop Under the right conditions potatoes grown for five years with\nproper care and good management are sure to make money One year\nout of five will break even, two years will make a little money and the\nother two years will make big money At the end of five years, with\ngood business management, the potato machinery will be all paid for,\nand there will be a substantial profit WHEEL HOE\nIn growing onions and other truck crops, where the rows are too close\ntogether for horse cultivation, the wheel hoe is valuable In fact, it is\nalmost indispensable when such crops are grown extensively The best\nwheel hoes have a number of attachments When the seed-bed has\nbeen carefully prepared, and the soil is fine and loose, the wheel hoe\nmay be used as soon as the young plants show above ground Men\nwho are accustomed to operating a wheel hoe become expert They\ncan work almost as close to the growing plants with an implement of\nthis kind as they can with an ordinary hand hoe The wheel hoe, or\nhand cultivator, works the ground on both sides of the row at once,\nand it does it quickly, so that very little hand weeding is necessary CHAPTER VI\nHANDLING THE HAY CROP\nREVOLVING HAYRAKE\nAbout the first contrivance for raking hay by horse power consisted of\na stick eight or ten feet long with double-end teeth running through it,\nand pointing in two directions These rakes were improved from time\nto time, until they reached perfection for this kind of tool They have\nsince been superseded by spring-tooth horse rakes, except for certain\npurposes For pulling field peas, and some kinds of beans, the old style\nrevolving horse rake is still in use Fig 143\nFigure 143",
    "143\nFigure 143 —Grass Hook, for working around borders where the lawn-mower\nis too clumsy Fig 144\nFigure 144 —Revolving Hayrake The center piece is 4″ x 6″ x 12′ long The\nteeth are double enders 13⁄8″ square and 4′ 6″ long, which allows 24″ of rake\ntooth clear of the center timber Every stick in the rake is carefully selected It\nis drawn by one horse If the center teeth stick into the ground either the horse\nmust stop instantly, or the rake must flop over, or there will be a repair job This invention has never been improved upon for pulling Canada peas Improved revolving horse rakes have a center timber of hardwood\nabout 4 x 6 inches in diameter The corners are rounded to facilitate\nsliding over the ground A rake twelve feet long will have about\neighteen double-end teeth The teeth project about two and one-half\nfeet each way from the center timber Each tooth is rounded up, sled-\nrunner fashion, at each end so it will point forward and slide along\nover and close to the ground without catching fast There is an iron\npull rod, or long hook, attached to each end of the center bar by\nmeans of a bolt that screws into the center of the end of the wooden\ncenter shaft, thus forming a gudgeon pin so the shaft can revolve Two\nhandles are fastened by band iron straps to rounded recesses or\ngirdles cut around the center bar These girdles are just far enough\napart for a man to walk between and to operate the handles Wooden,\nor iron lugs, reach down from the handles with pins projecting from\ntheir sides to engage the rake teeth Two pins project from the left lug\nand three from the right Sometimes notches are made in the lugs\ninstead of pins Notches are better; they may be rounded up to\nprevent catching when the rake revolves As the rake slides along, the\ndriver holds the rake teeth in the proper position by means of the\nhandles When sufficient load has been gathered he engages the upper\nnotch in the right hand lug, releases the left and raises the other\nsufficient to point the teeth into the ground The pull of the horse\nturns the rake over and the man grasps the teeth again with the\nhandle lugs as before Unless the driver is careful the teeth may stick\nin the ground and turn over before he is ready for it It requires a little\nexperience to use such a rake to advantage No better or cheaper way\n\n\nhas ever been invented for harvesting Canada peas The only\nobjections are that it shells some of the riper pods and it gathers up a\ncertain amount of earth with the vines which makes dusty threshing Fig 145\nFigure 145 —Buck Rake When hay is stacked in the field a four-horse buck\nrake is the quickest way to bring the hay to the stack The buck rake shown is\n16 feet wide and the 2 x 4 teeth are 11 feet long Two horses are hitched to\neach end and two drivers stand on the ends of the buck rake to operate it The\nload is pushed under the horse fork, the horses are swung outward and the\nbuck rake is dragged backward HAY-TEDDER\nThe hay-tedder is an English invention, which has been adopted by\nfarmers in rainy sections of the United States It is an energetic kicker\nthat scatters the hay swaths and drops the hay loosely to dry between\nshowers Hay may be made quickly by starting the tedder an hour\nbehind the mowing machine It is quite possible to cut timothy hay in the morning and put it in the\nmow in the afternoon, by shaking it up thoroughly once or twice with\nthe hay-tedder When clover is mixed with the timothy, it is necessary\nto leave it in the field until the next day, but the time between cutting\nand mowing is shortened materially by the use of the tedder Grass cut for hay may be kicked apart in the field early during the\nwilting process without shattering the leaves If left too long, then the\nhay-tedder is a damage because it kicks the leaves loose from the\nstems and the most valuable feeding material is wasted But it is a\ngood implement if rightly used",
    "But it is a\ngood implement if rightly used In catchy weather it often means the\ndifference between bright, valuable hay and black, musty stuff, that is\nhardly fit to feed Hay-tedders are expensive Where two farmers neighbor together the\nexpense may be shared, because the tedder does its work in two or\nthree hours’ time Careful farmers do not cut down much grass at one\ntime The tedder scatters two mowing swaths at once In fact the\nmowing machine, hay-tedder and horserake should all fit together for\nteam work so they will follow each other without skips or unnecessary\n\n\nlaps The dividing board of the mowing-machine marks a path for one\nof the horses to follow and it is difficult to keep him out of it But two\nhorses pulling a hay-tedder will straddle the open strip between the\nswaths when the tedder is twice the width of the cut HAY SKIDS\nFig 146\nFigure 146 —Hay Skid This hay skid is 8 feet wide and 16 feet long It is made\nof 7⁄8″ lumber put together with 2″ carriage bolts—plenty of them The round\nboltheads are countersunk into the bottom of the skid and the nuts are drawn\ndown tight on the cleats It makes a low-down, easy-pitching, hay-hauling\ndevice Fig 147\nFigure 147 —Hay Sling It takes no longer to hoist 500 pounds of hay than 100\npounds if the rig is large and strong enough Four feet wide by ten feet in\nlength is about right for handling hay quickly But the toggle must reach to the\nends of the rack if used on a wagon Fig 148\nFigure 148",

    "These iron U-clamp fasteners are much stronger and better\nthan bolts through the timbers Fig 151\nFigure 151 —Idaho Hay Derricks Two styles of hay derricks are used to stack\nalfalfa hay in Idaho The drawing to the left shows the one most in use because\nit is easier made and easier to move The derrick to the right usually is made\nlarger and more powerful Wire cable is generally used with both derricks\nbecause rope wears out quickly They are similar in operation but different in\nconstruction The base of each is 16 feet square and the high ends of the booms\nreach up nearly 40 feet A single hayfork rope, or wire cable, is used; it is\nabout 65 feet long The reach is sufficient to drop the hay in the center of a\nstack 24 feet wide Fig 152\nFigure 152 —Hay Carrier Carriage Powerful carriers are part of the new barn The track is double and the wheels run on both tracks to stand a side pull and\nto start quickly and run steadily when the clutch is released Fig 153\nFigure 153 —(1) Hayfork Hitch A whiffletree pulley doubles the speed of the\nfork The knot in the rope gives double power to start the load (2) Rafter\nGrapple, for attaching an extra pulley to any part of the barn roof There are timber braces fitted across the corners which are bolted\nthrough the outside timbers to brace the frame against a diamond\ntendency when moving the derrick There is considerable strain when\npassing over uneven ground It is better to make the frame so solid\nthat it cannot get out of square The mast is a stick of timber 8 inches\nsquare and 20 or 24 feet long This mast is securely fastened solid to\nthe center of the frame by having the bottom end mortised into the\n\n\ncenter cross timber at the middle and it is braced solid and held\nperpendicular to the framework by 4″ x 4″ wooden braces at the\ncorners These braces are notched at the top ends to fit the corners of\nthe mast and are beveled at the bottom ends to fit flat on top of the\ntimbers They are held in place by bolts and by strap iron or band iron\nbands These bands are drilled with holes and are spiked through into\nthe timbers with four-inch or five-inch wire nails Holes are drilled\nthrough the band iron the right size and at the proper places for the\nnails The mast is made round at the top and is fitted with a heavy\nwelded iron ring or band to prevent splitting The boom is usually\nabout 30 feet long Farmers prefer a round pole when they can get it It is attached to the top of the mast by an iron stirrup made by a\nblacksmith This stirrup is made to fit loosely half way around the\nboom one-third of the way up from the big end, which makes the\nsmall end of the boom project 20 feet out from the upper end of the\nmast The iron stirrup is made heavy and strong It has a round iron\ngudgeon 11⁄2″ in diameter that reaches down into the top of the mast\nabout 18 inches The shoulder of the stirrup is supported by a square,\nflat iron plate which rests on and covers the top of the mast and has\nthe corners turned down It is made large to shed water and protect\nthe top of the mast This plate has a hole one and a half inches in\ndiameter in the center through which the stirrup gudgeon passes as it\nenters the top of the mast A farm chain, or logging chain, is fastened\nto the large end of the boom by passing the chain around the boom\nand engaging the round hook The grab hook end of the chain is\npassed around the timber below and is hooked back to give it the\nright length, which doubles the part of the chain within reach of the\nman in charge This double end of the chain is lengthened or\nshortened to elevate the outer end of the boom to fit the stack The\nsmall outer end of the boom is thus raised as the stack goes up",
    "The\nsmall outer end of the boom is thus raised as the stack goes up Fig 154\nFigure 154 —Hay Rope Pulleys The housing of the pulley to the left prevents\nthe rope from running off the sheaves An ordinary horse fork and tackle is used to hoist the hay Three\nsingle pulleys are attached, one to the outer end of the boom, one\nnear the top of the mast, and the other at the bottom of the mast so\nthat the rope passes easily and freely through the three pulleys and at\n\n\nthe same time permits the boom to swing around as the fork goes up\nfrom the wagon rack over the stack This swinging movement is\nregulated by tilting the derrick towards the stack so that the boom\nswings over the stack by its own weight or by the weight of the hay\non the horse fork Usually a wire truss is rigged over the boom to\nstiffen it The wire is attached to the boom at both ends and the\nmiddle of the wire is sprung up to rest on a bridge placed over the\nstirrup Fig 155\nFigure 155 —Gambrel Whiffletree, for use in hoisting hay to prevent\nentanglements It is also handy when cultivating around fruit-trees Farmers like this simple form of hay derrick because it is cheaply\nmade and it may be easily moved because it is not heavy It is\nautomatic and it is about as cheap as any good derrick and it is the\nmost satisfactory for ordinary use The base is large enough to make it\nsolid and steady when in use Before moving the point of the boom is\nlowered to a level position so that the derrick is not top-heavy There\nis little danger of upsetting upon ordinary farm lands Also the width\nof 16 feet will pass along country roads without meeting serious\nobstacles Hay slings usually are made too narrow and too short The\nordinary little hay sling is prone to tip sideways and spill the hay It is\nresponsible for a great deal of profanity",
    "It is\nresponsible for a great deal of profanity The hay derrick shown to the\nright is somewhat different in construction, but is quite similar in\naction The base is the same but the mast turns on a gudgeon stepped\ninto an iron socket mortised into the center timber Fig 156\nFigure 156 —Cable Hay Stacker The wire cable is supported by the two bipods\nand is secured at each end by snubbing stakes Two single-cable collars are\nclamped to the cable to prevent the bipods from slipping in at the top Two\ndouble-cable clamps hold the ends of the cables to form stake loops The wire hoisting cable is threaded differently, as shown in the\ndrawing This style of derrick is made larger, sometimes the peak\nreaches up 40′ above the base The extra large ones are awkward to\n\n\nmove but they build fine big stacks Fig 157\nFigure 157 —California Hay Ricker, for putting either wild hay or alfalfa\nquickly in ricks It is used in connection with home-made buck rakes This\nricker works against the end of the rick and is backed away each time to start a\nnew bench The upright is made of light poles or 2 x 4s braced as shown It\nshould be 28 or 30 feet high Iron stakes hold the bottom, while guy wires\nsteady the top CALIFORNIA HAY RICKER\nIn the West hay is often put up in long ricks instead of stacks One of\nmy jobs in California was to put up 2,700 acres of wild hay in the\nSacramento Valley I made four rickers and eight buck rakes similar to\nthe ones shown in the illustrations Each ricker was operated by a\ncrew of eight men Four men drove two buck rakes There were two\non the rick, one at the fork and one to drive the hoisting rig Ten\nmowing machines did most of the cutting but I hired eight more\nmachines towards the last, as the latest grass was getting too ripe The\ncrop measured more than 2,100 tons and it was all put in ricks, stacks\nand barns without a drop of rain on it I should add that rain seldom\nfalls in the lower Sacramento Valley during the haying season in the\nmonths of May and June This refers to wild hay, which is made up of\nburr clover, wild oats and volunteer wheat and barley Alfalfa is cut from five to seven times in the hot interior valleys, so\nthat if a farmer is rash enough to plant alfalfa under irrigation his\nhaying thereafter will reach from one rainy season to the next CHAPTER VII\nFARM CONVEYANCES\nSTONE-BOAT\nOne of the most useful and one of the least ornamental conveyances\non a farm is the stone-boat It is a low-down handy rig for moving\nheavy commodities in summer as well as in winter No other sleigh or\nwagon will equal a stone-boat for carrying plows or harrows from one\nfield to another It is handy to tote bags of seed to supply the grain\ndrill, to haul a barrel of water, feed for the hogs, and a great many\nother chores Fig 158\nFigure 158 —Stone-Boat Stump logs are selected for the planks The bend of\nthe planks is the natural curve of the large roots The sawing is done by band\nsaw cutting from two directions When the country was new, sawmills made a business of sawing\nstone-boat plank Trees for stone-boat staves were cut close to the\nground and the natural crooks of the roots were used for the noses of\nsleigh runners and for stone-boats But cast-iron noses are now\nmanufactured with recesses to receive the ends of straight ordinary\nhardwood planks These cast-iron ends are rounded up in front to\nmake the necessary nose crook The front plank cross piece is bolted\nwell towards the front ends of the runner planks Usually there are\ntwo other hardwood plank cross pieces, one near the rear end and the\nother about one-third of the way back from the front Placing the\ncross pieces in this way gives room between to stand a barrel Fig 159\nFigure 159 —Wheelbarrow This factory-made wheelbarrow is the only pattern\nworth bothering with It is cheap and answers the purpose better than the\nheavier ones with removable side wings The cross pieces are bolted through from the bottom up Round-\nheaded bolts are used and they are countersunk, to come flush with\nthe bottom of the sliding planks The nuts are countersunk into the\ncross pieces by boring holes about one-quarter inch deep The holes\nare a little larger than the cornerwise diameter of the nuts No\nwashers are used, and the nuts are screwed down tight into the plank The ends of the bolts are cut off even and filed smooth The nuts are\nplaced sharp corner side down and are left nearly flush on top or even\nwith the surface of the cross pieces In using a stone-boat, nobody\nwants a projection to catch any part of the load Regular doubletree clevises are attached to the corners of the old-\nfashioned stone-boat and the side chains are brought together to a\nring and are just about long enough to form an equilateral triangle\nwith the front end of the stone-boat Cast-iron fronts usually have a\nprojection in the center for the clevis hitch OXEN ON A NEW ENGLAND FARM\nOne of the most interesting experiences on a New England farm is to\nget acquainted with the manner in which oxen are pressed into farm\nservice One reason why oxen have never gone out of fashion in New\nEngland is the fact that they are patient enough to plow stony ground\nwithout smashing the plow A great deal of New England farm land has been reclaimed by\nremoving a portion of the surface stone In the processes of freezing\nand thawing and cultivation, stones from underneath keep working up\nto the surface so that it requires considerable skill to do the necessary\nplowing and cultivating Oxen ease the plowpoint over or around a\nrock so it can immediately dip in again to the full depth of the furrow A good yoke of cattle well trained are gentle as well as strong and\npowerful Oxen are cheaper than horses to begin with and they are valuable for\nbeef when they are not needed any longer as work animals The\nHolstein breed seems to have the preference for oxen with New\nEngland farmers The necessary harness for a pair of cattle consists of\nan ox yoke with a ringbolt through the center of the yoke, midway\nbetween the two oxen A heavy iron ring about five inches in\ndiameter, made of round iron, hangs from the ring bolt There are two\n\n\noxbows to hold the yoke in place on the necks of the cattle A logging\nchain with a round hook on one end and a grab hook on the other end\ncompletes the yoking outfit The round hook of the chain is hitched into the ring in the plow\nclevis The chain is passed through the large iron ring in the oxbow\nand is doubled back to get the right length The grab hook is so\nconstructed that it fits over one link of the chain flatwise so that the\nnext link standing crosswise prevents it from slipping The mechanism of a logging chain is extremely simple, positive in\naction and especially well adapted to the use for which it is intended The best mechanical inventions often pass without notice because of\ntheir simplicity Farmers have used logging chains for generations\nwith hooks made on this plan without realizing that they were\nprofiting by a high grade invention that embodies superior merit In yoking oxen to a wagon the hitch is equally simple The end of the\nwagon tongue is placed in the ring in the ox yoke, the round hook\nengages with a drawbolt under the hammer strap bar The small grab\nhook is passed through the large yoke ring and is brought back and\nengaged with a chain link at the proper distance to stretch the chain\ntaut The process of yoking oxen and hitching them to a wagon is one of\nthe most interesting performances on a farm The off ox works on the\noff side, or far side from the driver He usually is the larger of the two\nand the more intelligent The near (pronounced n-i-g-h) ox is nearest\nto the driver who walks to the left Old plows turned the furrow to the\nright so the driver could walk on hard ground In this way the\nawkwardness and ignorance of the near ox is played against the\ndocility and superior intelligence of the off ox In yoking the two\ntogether the yoke is first placed on the neck of the off ox and the near\nox is invited to come under This expression is so apt that a great\nmany years ago it became a classic in the hands of able writers to\nsuggest submission or slavery termed “coming under the yoke ”\nComing under the yoke, however, for the New England ox, in these\ndays of abundant feeding, is no hardship The oxen are large and\npowerful and the work they have to do is just about sufficient to give\nthem the needed exercise to enjoy their alfalfa hay and feed of oats or\ncorn TRAVOY\nOne of the first implements used by farm settlers in the timbered\nsections of the United States and Canada, was a three-cornered sled\nmade from the fork of a tree This rough sled, in the French speaking\nsettlements, was called a “travoy ” Whether it was of Indian or French\ninvention is not known; probably both Indians and French settlers\nused travoys for moving logs in the woods before American history\nwas much written The legs or runners of a travoy are about five feet\nlong There is a bunk which extends crossways from one runner to the\nother, about half or two-thirds of the way back from the turned-up\nnose This bunk is fastened to the runners by means of wooden pins\nand U-shaped bows fitted into grooves cut around the upper half of\nthe bunk near the ends Just back of the turned up nose is another\ncross piece in the shape of a stout wooden pin or iron bolt that is\npassed through an auger hole extending through both legs from side\nto side of the travoy The underside of the crotch is hollowed out in\nfront of the bolt to make room to pass the logging chain through so it\ncomes out in front under the turned up nose Fig 160\nFigure 160 —Travoy A log-hauling sled made from the fork of a tree The front of the travoy is turned up, sled runner fashion, by hewing\nthe wood with an axe to give it the proper shape Travoys are used to\nhaul logs from a thick woods to the skidways The manner of using a\ntravoy is interesting It is hauled by a yoke of cattle or a team of\nhorses to the place where the log lies in the woods The round hook\nend of the logging chain is thrown over the butt end of the log and\npulled back under the log then around the bunk just inside of the\nrunner and hooked fast upon itself The travoy is then leaned over\nagainst the log, the grab hook end of the chain is brought over the log\nand over the travoy and straightened out at right angles to the log The cattle are hitched to the end of the logging chain and started This\nkind of a hitch rolls the log over on top of the bunk on the travoy The\ncattle are then unhitched The grab hook end of the chain thus\nreleased is passed down and around under the other end of the bunk\nfrom behind The chain is then passed over the bolt near the nose of\n\n\nthe travoy and pulled down through the opening and out in front from\nunder the nose The small grab hook of the logging chain is then\npassed through the clevis, in the doubletree, if horses are used, or the\nring in the yoke if cattle are used, and hitched back to the proper\nlength A little experience is necessary to regulate the length of the\nchain to give the proper pull The chain should be short enough so the\npull lifts a little It is generally conceded by woodsmen that a short\nhitch moves a log easier than a long hitch However, there is a\nmedium There are limitations which experience only can determine A travoy is useful in dense woods where there is a good deal of\nundergrowth or where there are places so rough that bobsleighs\ncannot be used to advantage LINCHPIN FARM WAGONS\nFig 161\nFigure 161 —Cross Reach Wagon This wagon is coupled for a trailer, but it\nworks just as well when used with a tongue and horses as a handy farm wagon The bunks are made rigid and parallel by means of a double reach There are\ntwo king bolts to permit both axles to turn Either end is front Fig 162\nFigure 162 —Wagon Brake The hounds are tilted up to show the brake beam\nand the manner of attaching it The brake lever is fastened to the forward side\nof the rear bolster and turns up alongside of the bolster stake The brake rod\nreaches from the upper end of the lever elbow to the foot ratchet at the front\nend of the wagon box Fig 163\nFigure 163 —Bolster Spring In some parts of the country the wheels of handy wagons about the\nfarm are held on axle journals by means of linchpins in the old-\nfashioned manner There are iron hub-bands on both ends of the hubs\nwhich project several inches beyond the wood This is the best\nprotection against sand to prevent it from working into the wheel\nboxing that has ever been invented Sand from the felloes scatters\ndown onto these iron bands and rolls off to the ground There is a\n\n\nhole through each band on the outer ends of the hubs to pass the\nlinchpin through so that before taking off a wheel to oil the journal it\nmust first be turned so the hole comes directly over the linchpin To\npry out the linchpin the drawbolt is used Old-fashioned drawbolts\nwere made with a chisel shaped end tapered from both sides to a\nthickness of about an eighth of an inch This thin wedge end of the\ndrawbolt is placed under the end of the linchpin The lower side of\nthe hub-band forms a fulcrum to pry the pin up through the hole in\nthe upper side of the sand-band projection The linchpin has a hook\non the outer side of the upper end so the lever is transferred to the top\nof the sand-band when another pry lifts the pin clear out of the hole\nin the end of the axle so the wheel may be removed and grease\napplied to the axle The drawbolt on a linchpin wagon usually has a\nhead made in the form of the jaws of a wrench The wrench is the\nright size to fit the nuts on the wagon brace irons so that the drawbolt\nanswers three purposes Fig 164\nFigure 164 —Wagon Seat Spring The metal block fits over the top of the\nbolster stake Fig 165\nFigure 165 —Hollow Malleable Iron Bolster Stake to hold a higher wooden\nstake when necessary SAND-BANDS\nMany parts of farm machinery require projecting sand-bands to\nprotect the journals from sand and dust Most farms have some sandy\nfields or ridges Some farms are all sand or sandy loam Even dust\nfrom clay is injurious to machinery There is more or less grit in the\nfinest clay The most important parts of farm machinery are supposed\nto be protected by oil-cups containing cotton waste to strain the oil,\ntogether with covers in the shape of metal caps These are necessary\nprotections and they help, but they are not adequate for all\nconditions It is not easy to keep sand out of bearings on machinery\nthat shakes a good deal Wooden plugs gather sand and dust When a\nplug is pulled the sand drops into the oil hole Farm machinery that is\n\n\nproperly designed protects itself from sand and dust In buying a\nmachine this particular feature should appeal to the farmers more\nthan it does Leather caps are a nuisance They are a sort of patchwork\nto finish the job that the manufacturer commences A man who is\nprovident enough to supply himself with good working tools and is\nsufficiently careful to take care of them, usually is particular about the\nappearance as well as the usefulness of his tools, machinery and\nimplements Fig 166\nFigure 166 —Sand Caps Not one manufacturer in a hundred knows how to\nkeep sand out of an axle bearing Still it is one of the simplest tricks in\nmechanics The only protection an axle needs is long ferrules that reach out\nthree or four inches beyond the hub at both ends Old-fashioned Linchpin farm\nwagons were built on this principle The hubs held narrow rings instead of\nskeins, but they wore for years BOBSLEIGHS\nOn Northern farms bobsleighs are as important in the winter time as a\nfarm wagon in summer There are different ways of putting bobsleighs\ntogether according to the use required of them When using heavy\nbobsleighs for road work, farmers favor the bolster reach to connect\nthe front and rear sleighs With this attachment the horses may be\nturned around against the rear sled The front bolster fits into a\nrecessed plate bolted to the bench plank of the front sleigh This plate\nis a combination of wearing plate and circle and must be kept oiled to\nturn easily under a heavy load It not only facilitates turning, but it\nprevents the bolster from catching on the raves or on the upturned\nnose of the front bob when turning short The heavy hardwood plank reach that connects the two bolsters is put\nthrough a mortise through the front bolster and is fastened rigidly by\nan extra large king-bolt The reach plays back and forth rather loosely\nthrough a similar mortise in the other bolster on the rear sleigh The\nrear hounds connect with the reach by means of a link and pin This\nlink pushes up through mortise holes in the reach and is fastened with\na wooden pin or key on top of the reach Sometimes the hounds are\ntaken away and the reach is fastened with pins before and behind the\n\n\nrear bolster This reach hitch is not recommended except for light\nroad work These two ways of attaching the rear sled necessitate\ndifferent ways of fastening the rear bolster to the sled When the rear\nbolster is required to do the pulling, it is attached to the sled by\ndouble eyebolts which permit the necessary rocking motion and\nallows the nose of the rear sled to bob up and down freely This is an\nadvantage when a long box bed is used, because the bolster is made to\nfit the box closely and is not continually oscillating and wearing Eye-\nbolts provide for this natural movement of the sled Light pleasure\nbobs are attached to the box with eyebolts without bolster stakes The\nlight passenger riding seat box is bound together with iron braces and\nside irons so it does not need bolsters

presses the soft\nearth into place and leaves the surface smooth Fig 223\nFigure 223 223\nFigure 223 —Split-Log Road Drag The front edge is shod with a steel plate to\ndo the cutting and the round side of the rear log grinds the loosened earth fine\nand presses it into the wagon tracks and water holes Fig 224\nFigure 224 —Heavy Breaking Plow, used for road work and other tough jobs Unfortunately, the habit of using narrow tired wagons on country\nroads has become almost universal in the United States To add to\ntheir destructive propensities, all wagons in some parts of the country\nhave the same width of tread so that each wheel follows in paths\nmade by other wheels, until they cut ruts of considerable depth These\nlittle narrow ditches hold water so that it cannot run off into the\ndrains at the sides of the roadway When a rut gets started, each\npassing wheel squeezes out the muddy water, or if the wheel be\nrevolving at a speed faster than a walk it throws the water, and the\nwater carries part of the roadway with it so that small ruts are made\nlarge and deep ruts are made deeper In some limited sections road\nrules demand that wagons shall have wide tires and have shorter front\n\n\naxles, so that with the wide tires and the uneven treads the wheels act\nas rollers instead of rut makers It is difficult to introduce such\nrequirements into every farm section In the meantime the evils of\nnarrow tires may be overcome to a certain extent by the persistent\nand proper use of the split-log road drag These drags are most\neffectual in the springtime when the frost is coming out of the ground During the muddy season the roads get worked up into ruts and mire\nholes, which, if taken in time, may be filled by running lengthwise of\nthe road with the drag when the earth is still soft When the ground\nshows dry on top and is still soft and wet underneath is the time the\ndrags do the best work by scraping the drier hummocks into the low\nplaces where the earth settles hard as it dries A well rounded, smooth road does not get muddy in the summer time Summer rains usually come with a dash Considerable water falls in a\nshort time, and the very act of falling with force first lays the dust,\nthen packs the surface The smooth packed surface acts like a roof,\nand almost before the rain stops falling all surface water is drained off\nto the sides so that an inch down under the surface the roadbed is as\nhard as it was before the rain That is the reason why split log road\ndrags used persistently in the spring and occasionally later in the\nseason will preserve good roads all summer It is very much better to\nfollow each summer rain with the road drag, but it is not so necessary\nas immediate attention at the proper time in spring Besides, farmers\nare so busy during the summer months that they find it difficult to\nspend the time In some sections of the middle West one man is hired\nto do the dragging at so much per trip over the road He makes his\ncalculations accordingly and is prepared to do the dragging at all\nseasons when needed This plan usually works out the best because\none man then makes it his business and he gets paid for the amount of\nwork performed This man should live at the far end of the road\ndivision so that he can smooth his own pathway leading to town STEEL ROAD DRAG\nManufacturers are making road drags of steel with tempered blades\nadjustable to any angle by simply moving the lever until the dog\nengages in the proper notch Some of these machines are made with\nblades reversible, so that the other side can be used for cutting when\nthe first edge is worn For summer use the steel drag works very well,\n\n\nbut it lacks the smoothing action of a well balanced log drag SEED HOUSE AND BARN TRUCKS\nFig 225\nFigure 225 —Barn Trucks The platform truck is made to move boxed apples\nand other fruit The bag truck is well proportioned and strong, but is not full\nironed Bag trucks for handling bags of grain and seeds should be heavy Bag\ntruck wheels should be eight inches in diameter with a three-inch\nface The steel bar or shoe that lifts and carries the bag should be\ntwenty-two inches in length That means that the bottom of the truck\nin front is twenty-two inches wide The wheels run behind this bar so\nthe hubs do not project to catch against standing bags or door frames The length of truck handles from the steel lift bar to the top end of the\nhand crook is four feet, six inches In buying bag trucks it is better to\nget the heavy solid kind that will not upset The light ones are a great\nnuisance when running them over uneven floors The wheels are too\nnarrow and too close together and the trucks tip over under slight\nprovocation Platform trucks for use in moving boxes of apples or\ncrates of potatoes or bags of seed in the seed house or warehouse also\nshould be heavy The most approved platform truck, the kind that\nmarket men use, is made with a frame four feet in length by two feet\nin width The frame is made of good solid hardwood put together with\nmortise and tenon The cross pieces or stiles are three-quarters of an\ninch lower than the side pieces or rails, which space is filled with\nhardwood flooring boards firmly bolted to the cross pieces so they\ncome up flush with the side timbers The top of the platform should\nbe sixteen inches up from the floor There are two standards in front\nwhich carry a wooden crossbar over the front end of the truck This\ncrossbar is used for a handle to push or pull the truck The height of\nthe handle-bar from the floor is three feet Rear wheels are five inches\nin diameter and work on a swivel so they turn in any direction like a\ncastor The two front wheels carry the main weight",
    "The two front wheels carry the main weight They are twelve\ninches in diameter with a three-inch face The wheels are bored to fit\na one-inch steel axle and have wide boxings bolted to the main\ntimbers of the truck frame Like the two-wheel bag truck, the wheels\n\n\nof the platform truck are under the frame so they do not project out in\nthe way, which is a great advantage when the truck is being used in a\ncrowded place Fig 226\nFigure 226 —Farm Gate Post with Copper Mail Box Fig 227\nFigure 227 227\nFigure 227 —Concrete Post Supporting a Waterproof Clothes Line Reel Box Fig 228\nFigure 228 —Dumb Waiter The cage is poised by a counterweight It is guided\nby a rope belt which runs on grooved pulleys at the top and bottom HOME CANNING OUTFIT\nThere are small canning outfits manufactured and sold for farm use\nthat work on the factory principle For canning vegetables, the\nheating is done under pressure because a great deal of heat is\nnecessary to destroy the bacteria that spoil vegetables in the cans Steam under pressure is a good deal hotter than boiling water There\nis considerable work in using a canning outfit, but it gets the canning\nout of the way quickly Extra help may be employed for a few days to\ndo the canning on the same principle that farmers employ extra help\nat threshing time and do it all up at once Of course, fruits and\nvegetables keep coming along at different times in the summer, but\nthe fall fruit canning may be done at two or three sittings arranged a\nweek or two apart and enough fruit packed away in the cellar to last a\nbig family a whole year Canning machinery is simple and\ninexpensive",

    "The principles of\nconstruction require that a septic tank shall be large enough to\ncontain two days’ supply of sewerage in each compartment; thus,\nrequiring four days for the sewerage to enter and leave the tank Fig 238\nFigure 238 —Brass Valves Two kinds of globe valves are used in farm\nwaterworks The straight valve shown to the left and the right angle valve to\nthe right Either one may be fitted with a long shank to reach above ground\nwhen pipes are laid deep to prevent freezing Estimating 75 gallons daily of sewerage for each inhabitant of the\nhouse and four persons to a family, the septic tank should be large\nenough to hold 600 gallons, three hundred gallons in each\ncompartment, which would require a tank about four feet in width\nand six feet in length and four feet in depth These figures embrace\nmore cubic feet of tank than necessary to meet the foregoing\nrequirements It is a good plan to leave a margin of safety Fig 239\nFigure 239 —Septic Tank, a double antiseptic process for purifying sewerage It is usual to lay a vitrified sewer, four inches in diameter, from below\nthe bottom of the cellar to the septic tank, giving it a fall of one-\neighth inch in ten feet The sewer enters the tank at the top of the\nstanding liquid and delivers the fresh sewerage from the house\nthrough an elbow and a leg of pipe that reaches to within about six\ninches of the bottom of the tank The reason for this is to admit fresh\nsewerage without disturbing the scum on the surface of the liquid in\n\n\nthe tank The scum is a protection for the bacteria It helps them to\ncarry on their work of destruction The same principle applies to the\nsecond compartment The liquid from the first compartment is carried\nover into the second compartment by means of a bent pipe in the\nform of a siphon which fills up gradually and empties automatically\nwhen the liquid in the first compartment rises to a certain level The\ndischarging siphon leg should be the shortest The liquid from the\nsecond compartment is discharged into the drain in the same manner There are special valves made for the final discharge, but they are not\nnecessary The bottom of the tank is dug deep enough to hold\nsewerage from two to four feet in depth The top surface of the liquid\nin the tank is held down to a level of at least six inches below the\nbottom of the cellar So there is no possible chance of the house sewer\nfilling and backing up towards the house Usually the vitrified sewer\npipe is four inches in diameter, the septic tank siphons for a small\ntank are three inches in diameter and the final discharge pipe is three\ninches in diameter, with a rapid fall for the first ten feet after leaving\nthe tank Septic tanks should be made of concrete, waterproofed on the inside\nto prevent the possibility of seepage Septic tank tops are made of\nreinforced concrete with manhole openings Also the manhole covers\nare made of reinforced concrete, either beveled to fit the openings or\nmade considerably larger than the opening, so that they sit down flat\non the top surface of the tank These covers are always deep enough\ndown in the ground so that when covered over the earth holds them\nin place In laying vitrified sewer it is absolutely necessary to calk each joint\nwith okum or lead, or okum reinforced with cement It is almost\nimpossible to make a joint tight with cement alone, although it can be\ndone by an expert Each length of the sewer-pipe should be given a\nuniform grade The vitrified sewer is trapped outside of the building\nwith an ordinary S-trap ventilated, which leaves the sewer open to the\natmosphere and prevents the possibility of back-pressure that might\ndrive the poisonous gases from the decomposing sewerage through\nthe sewer back into the house In this way, the septic tank is made\nentirely separate from the house plumbing, except that the two\nsystems are connected at this outside trap It is sometimes recommended that the waste water from the second\n\n\ncompartment shall be distributed through a series of drains made with\nthree-inch or four-inch drain tile and that the outlet of this set of\ndrains shall empty into or connect with a regularly organized field\ndrainage system Generally speaking, the final discharge of liquid\nfrom a septic tank that is properly constructed is inoffensive and\nharmless However, it is better to use every possible precaution to\npreserve the health of the family, and it is better to dispose of the\nfinal waste in such a way as to prevent any farm animal from drinking\nit While manholes are built into septic tanks for the purpose of\nexamination, in practice they are seldom required If the tanks are\nproperly built and rightly proportioned to the sewerage requirements\nthey will take care of the waste water from the house year after year\nwithout attention Should any accidents occur, they are more likely to\nbe caused by a leakage in the vitrified sewer than from any other\ncause Manufacturers of plumbing supplies furnish the siphons\ntogether with instructions for placing them properly in the concrete\nwalls Some firms supply advertising matter from which to work out\nthe actual size and proportions of the different compartments and all\nconnections The making of a septic tank is simple when the principle\nis once understood",
