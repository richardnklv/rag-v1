    "In fact, new techniques for\nremote cannulation have been developed (Pompili _et al _,\n1996; Stevens _et al _, 1996) Furthermore, with the\nchanges in size and location of incisions, visualization\nsystems and robotic telemanipulation systems have had\nto be developed to allow the surgeon to perform precise\nsurgical maneuvers that mimic human dexterity This\narticle will review the history of robotic applications in\ncardiac surgery and highlight our early clinical\nexperience This\narticle will review the history of robotic applications in\ncardiac surgery and highlight our early clinical\nexperience **2 History of Robotic Systems**\n\nSix degrees of freedom are required to allow free\norientation in space Thus, standard endoscopic\ninstruments with only four degrees of freedom\ndramatically reduce dexterity When working through a\nfixed entry point, such as a trocar, the operator must\nreverse hand motions (the fulcrum effect) At the same\ntime, instrument shaft shear, or drag, induces the need\nfor higher manipulation forces, leading to hand muscle\nfatigue Also, human motor skills deteriorate with visualmotor incompatibility, which is commonly associated\nwith endoscopic surgery Computer-enhanced\ninstrumentation systems have been developed to\novercome these and other limitations These systems\nprovide both telemanipulation and micromanipulation of\ntissues in confined spaces The surgeon operates from a\nconsole, immersed in a three-dimensional view of the\n\n\n87\n\n\noperative field Through a computer interface, the\nsurgeon’s motions are reproduced in scaled proportion\nthrough “microwrist” instruments that are mounted on\nrobotic arms inserted through the chest wall These\ninstruments emulate human X-Y-Z axis wrist activity\nthroughout seven full degrees of freedom During the early 1990s, extensive research conducted on\nrobotic applications in surgery resulted in the emergence\nof two robotic systems Based on technology developed\nby the Stanford Research Institute, Frederic Moll, MD,\nRobert Younge, and John Freund, MD developed the da\nVinci System (Intuitive Surgical, Mountain View, CA) in\n1995 The system stressed the telepresence concept, with\nthe surgeon immersed in a full three-dimensional\nexperience that created the sense that the operative site\nwas directly in view The hand motions exactly\nreplicated the motions of open surgery through the use of\n“endowrists ” As a result, the learning curve was\nminimized The Computer Motion (Santa Barbara, CA)\nsystem, Zeus was developed as an integrated robotic\nsurgical system Yulun Wang, PhD, founded the\ncompany in 1989 and initially developed a voicecontrolled robotic arm called the Automated Endoscopic\nSystem for Optimal Positioning (AESOP), which would\nbe used as a laparoscopic camera holder The Zeus\nsystem did not attempt to create an immersive intuitive\ninterface; rather, the surgeon was fully aware of\nperforming a robotic procedure The fulcrum effect of\nlaparoscopic surgery was retained, as well as the obvious\nmonitor for viewing",
    "The fulcrum effect of\nlaparoscopic surgery was retained, as well as the obvious\nmonitor for viewing **3 AESOP Robotic System**\n\nIn 1994, AESOP became the first medical robot to\nreceive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval\nin the United States Two years later, voice control by\nthe surgeon was added, allowing for exact, hands-free\ncontrol of an endoscope during an operation This robotic\narm is capable of responding to over 20 simple voice\ncommands In 1996, while general surgeons were already\nusing this device, Carpentier performed the first videoassisted mitral valve repair via a minithoracotomy using\nventricular fibrillation (Carpentier _et al _, 1996) Three\nmonths later, our group at East Carolina University\n(ECU) completed a mitral valve replacement using a\nmicroincision, videoscopic vision, percutaneous\ntransthoracic aortic clamp, and retrograde cardioplegia\n(Chitwood _et al _, 1997) In 1997, Mohr first used the\nAESOP voice-activated camera robot in minimally\ninvasive videoscopic mitral valve surgery (Mohr _et al _,\n1998) Microincisions or port incisions (4 cm) were used\nand most of the operation was performed via secondary\nor assisted vision In June 1998, our group performed the\nfirst completely video-directed mitral operation in the\nUnited States using AESOP and a Vista (Vista\nCardiothoracic Systems, Inc , Westborough, MA) threedimensional camera (Chitwood _et al _, 1997) _, 1997) Continued\nexperience, advances in three-dimensional videoscopy,\nand voice activated camera control with AESOP allowed\n\nthe use of even smaller incisions with better visualization\n\n\n88\n\n\n\nof both valvular and subvalvular components of the\nmitral valve The voice-activated camera provides direct\neye-brain-action translation for the surgeon without an\nintermediary assistant Camera manipulation\nrequirements are diminished, movements are more\npredictable, and lens cleaning is reduced, enabling the\nsurgeon more operative flexibility and speed",
    "Camera manipulation\nrequirements are diminished, movements are more\npredictable, and lens cleaning is reduced, enabling the\nsurgeon more operative flexibility and speed **4 Zeus Robotic System**\n\nThe Zeus system is composed of three interactive arms,\nmounted directly on the operating table compared with\nthe da Vinci, which is positioned on the floor next to the\npatient (Figs 1A and 1B) 1A and 1B) The surgeon’s movements are\ndigitalized and filtered by a signal processor before being\nrelayed to the robotic arms The surgeon is seated at a\nremote console, and handles provide a sensitive robotic\ninterface The system mechanically relays the surgeon’s\nhand movements to a computer controller The basic\nZeus visualization system is two-dimensional; however,\nit can be used in combination with new and\nindependently developed three-dimensional visualization\nsystems The surgeon remains seated with the\nendoscopic image displayed at eye level and close to the\nhands Although the Zeus system lacks a fully articulated\nwrist and allows only four degrees of freedom, the\ninstrument diameter is a small 3 9 mm compared with\nthe 7 mm da Vinci arm Recently, some instrument tips\nhave been developed that provide five degrees of\nfreedom through the use of a “microwrist ” More than 20\ndifferent end-effectors exist within this system, including\nneedle drivers, tissue graspers, and microscissors These\ninstruments are easily interchangeable during the\nsurgical procedure The arms on which these instruments\nare mounted are lightweight and flexible, allowing the\nsurgical team to stand close to the patient The arms on which these instruments\nare mounted are lightweight and flexible, allowing the\nsurgical team to stand close to the patient Fig 1A Zeus tableside robotic system Fig 1B da Vinci tableside robotic system",
    "da Vinci tableside robotic system **5 da Vinci Robotic System**\n\nThree components comprise the da Vinci system: a\nsurgeon console, an instrument cart, and a visioning\nplatform The operative console is physically remote\nfrom the patient and allows the surgeon to sit\ncomfortably, resting the arms ergonomically with his or\nher head positioned in a three-dimensional vision array Through sensors, the surgeon’s finger and wrist\nmovements are digitally registered in computer memory\nbanks; these actions are efficiently transferred to an\ninstrument cart, which operates the synchronous endeffector instruments (Fig 2) 2) Wrist-like instrument\narticulation precisely emulates the surgeon’s actions at\nthe tissue level and enhances dexterity through combined\ntremor suppression and motion scaling A clutching\nmechanism enables readjustment of hand positions to\nmaintain an optimal ergonomic attitude with respect to\nthe visual field Fig 2 End-effector arms of da Vinci system\ndemonstrating multiple axis of rotation This clutch acts very much like a computer mouse,\nwhich can be reoriented by lifting and repositioning it to\nre-establish unrestrained freedom of computer activation The three-dimensional digital visioning system enables\nnatural depth perception with high-power magnification\n(10X) Both 0° and 30° endoscopes can be manipulated\nto look either “up” or “down” within the heart Access to\nand visualization of the internal thoracic artery, coronary\narteries, and mitral apparatus is excellent The operator\nbecomes ensconced in the three-dimensional operative\ntopography and can perform extremely precise surgical\nmanipulations devoid of traditional distractions Through 1 cm ports, instruments are positioned near the\ncardiac operative site in the thorax, and the camera is\npassed via a 4 cm working port used for suture and\nprosthesis passage (Fig 3)",
    "3) Every analog finger\nmovement, along with inherent human tremor at 8–10\nHz/second, is converted to binary digital data, which are\nsmoothed and filtered to increase micro instrument\n\nprecision The wrist-like articulation and motion\nsuppression allow both increased precision and dexterity\nwith the surgeon becoming truly ambidextrous Six\ndegrees of freedom are offered by this combination of\ntrocar-positioned arms (insertion, pitch, and yaw) and\narticulated instrument wrists (roll, grip, pitch, and yaw) Fig 3 4-cm incision in the right 4th intercostal space 4-cm incision in the right 4th intercostal space Fig 4 4 View with the da Vinci system of the mitral\nvalve 89\n\n\nFull X-Y-Z axis agility is affected by coordinating foot\npedal clutching and hand motion sensors Hand activity\nat the console is exactly reproduced at the surgical field\nwhile foot pedals control the camera position and focus Coordination of these eye-hand-foot movements enables\nthe surgeon to ratchet articulated wrists smoothly\nthrough every coordinate, allowing for complex\ninstrument positions while providing maximum\nergonomic comfort Fig 4 shows the surgeon’s operative\nfield during a da Vinci mitral repair **6 Robotics in Cardiac Valve Surgery**\n\nIn 2001, Felger reported on 72 robotically directed mitral\nvalve surgeries performed at ECU with the AESOP\nsystem These patients were compared to 55 manually\ndirected patients (an assistant directed by the surgeon)\nundergoing mitral valve surgery (Felger _et al _, 2001) _, 2001) Perioperative data analysis revealed that 75% of the\nrobotically directed group underwent mitral valve repair,\nwhich included quadrangular resections, sliding plasties,\nchord replacement/repair, and Alfieri-plasties Despite\nthe complexity of these cases, robotically directed crossclamp times were significantly less than the manually\ndirected cohort (90",
    "Despite\nthe complexity of these cases, robotically directed crossclamp times were significantly less than the manually\ndirected cohort (90 0 ± 4 6 minutes versus 128 0 ± 4 5\nminutes; p<0 001) Cardiopulmonary bypass times were\nless in the robotically directed group (143 Cardiopulmonary bypass times were\nless in the robotically directed group (143 3 ± 4 6\nminutes versus 172 8 ± 5 7 minutes; p<0 001) 001) This time\ndifference reflects the importance of robotic assistance,\nas less time was required for positioning the endoscope\nand cleaning the lens, enabling the surgeon to perform\nthe operation more expeditiously Comparative lengths\nof hospital stay were the same for the robotically directed\nand manually directed groups, but significantly less than\na historical control of conventional sternotomy mitral\nsurgery patients (4 Comparative lengths\nof hospital stay were the same for the robotically directed\nand manually directed groups, but significantly less than\na historical control of conventional sternotomy mitral\nsurgery patients (4 6 ± 0 3 days vs 7 9 ± 0 6 days;\np<0 001) There were two (3%) conversions to\nsternotomy secondary to bleeding in the robotically\ndirected group There were no permanent neurologic\nevents in this group and no patients underwent prolonged\nventilation (>48 hours) Thirty-day operative mortality\nwas 2 3%, demonstrating both the efficacy and safety of\nthis approach Other groups have reported similar success using\nAESOP with minimally invasive mitral valve surgery Mishra and colleagues from the Escorts Heart Institute in\nIndia reported their experience in 221 patients, in which\nthe AESOP system was used in 120 patients (Mishra _et_\n_al _, 2002)",
    "_, 2002) Perfusion and aortic cross-clamp times were\n126 ± 41 minutes and 58 ± 16 minutes, respectively When compared to a conventional incision cohort, there\nwas no significant difference Most of these operations\n(81%) involved valve replacement accounting for the\nshorter perfusion times when compared with our series\nwhere only 25% of mitral valve operations were\nreplacements Excellent clinical results were achieved\nwith no permanent neurologic deficits and an operative\nmortality of 0 45% 45% There were no reoperations in a\nfollow-up period of 16 months, again demonstrating the\nsafety and efficacy of robotically assisted minimally\n\n\n90\n\n\n\ninvasive mitral valve surgery In May 1998, using an early prototype of the da Vinci\narticulated “microwrist,” Carpentier performed the first\ntrue robotic mitral valve repair (Carpentier _et al _, 1998) In May 2000, our group performed the first complete\nrepair of a mitral valve in North America using the da\nVinci system (Chitwood _et al _, 2000) _, 2000) With articulated\nwrist instruments, a trapezoidal resection of a large P 2\nscallop was performed with the defect closed using\nmultiple interrupted sutures, followed by implantation of\na #28 Cosgrove annuloplasty band The same year we\ncompleted an FDA safety and efficacy clinical trial in 10\npatients Quadrangular leaflet resections, leaflet sliding\nplasties, chord transfers, polytetrafluoroethylene chord\nreplacements, reduction annuloplasties, and annuloplasty\nband insertions were all successfully performed The\nmean total arrest time was 150 minutes, with 52 minutes\nused for leaflet repairs Of the total arrest time, a mean of\n42 minutes was needed to place an average of 7",
    "Of the total arrest time, a mean of\n42 minutes was needed to place an average of 7 5\nannuloplasty band sutures Total operating room time\naveraged 4 8 hours 8 hours There were no device-related\ncomplications, and only one re-exploration for bleeding\nfrom an atrial pacing wire The average postoperative\nstay was 4 days (range 3-7 days) At three-month followup, echocardiography revealed nothing more remarkable\nthan trace mitral regurgitation All patients returned to\nnormal activity by one month after surgery (Chitwood\nWR Jr & LW All patients returned to\nnormal activity by one month after surgery (Chitwood\nWR Jr & LW , 2001) , 2001) We recently published our results of the first 38 mitral\nrepairs with the da Vinci system (Nifong _et al _, 2003) For data analysis and comparison, patients were divided\ninto two cohorts of 19 patients (early experience and late\nexperience) Total robotic time represents the exact time\nof robot deployment after valve exposure and continued\nuntil the end of annuloplasty band placement This time\ndecreased significantly from 1 9 ± 0 1 hours in the first\ngroup to 1 5 ± 0 1 hours in the second group (p=0 002) 002) Concurrently, leaflet repair time fell significantly from\n1 Concurrently, leaflet repair time fell significantly from\n1 0 ± 0 1 hours to 0 6 ± 0 1 hours, respectively\n(p=0 004) Also, total operating time decreased\nsignificantly from 5 Also, total operating time decreased\nsignificantly from 5 1 ± 0 1 hours to 4 4 ± 0",
    "4 ± 0 1 hours in\nthe second group of patients Furthermore, both crossclamp and bypass times decreased significantly with\nexperience Similar time trends were reported in a later\npublication that reviewed subsequent patients that\nunderwent robotic mitral repair at our institution with the\nda Vinci system (Kypson _et al Similar time trends were reported in a later\npublication that reviewed subsequent patients that\nunderwent robotic mitral repair at our institution with the\nda Vinci system (Kypson _et al _, 2003) The only time\nthat did not change between the two groups was the\nannuloplasty band placement time Most likely, this\nrepresents an inherent limitation in the current\ntechnology of tying suture knots Even with extensive\nexperience, the speed of suture placement is limited Alternative methods of implanting the annuloplasty ring\nmay decrease this time in the future Alternative methods of implanting the annuloplasty ring\nmay decrease this time in the future For the entire group\nof 38 patients, the mean length of stay was 3 8 days, with\nno difference between the two groups For all patients in\nthe study, 84% demonstrated a reduction of three or\nmore grades in mitral regurgitation at follow-up In the\nentire series there were no device-related complications\nor operative deaths One valve was replaced at 19 days\n\n\nbecause of hemolysis secondary to a leak that was\ndirected against a prosthetic chord Besides our own experience, results from a prospective\nmulticenter phase II FDA trial were recently submitted\n(Chitwood Jr WR _et al,_ in press _ _ )",
    "_ ) In this trial involving\n10 institutions, the da Vinci system was used to perform\nmitral valve repairs in 112 patients Valve repairs\nincluded quadrangular resections, sliding-plasties, edgeto-edge approximations, and both chordal transfers and\nreplacements Leaflet repair times averaged 36 Leaflet repair times averaged 36 7 ± 0 2\nminutes with annuloplasty times of 39 6 ± 0 1 minutes Total robotic, aortic cross-clamp, and cardiopulmonary\nbypass times were 77 Total robotic, aortic cross-clamp, and cardiopulmonary\nbypass times were 77 9 ± 0 3 minutes, 2 1 ± 0 1 hours,\nand 2 8 ± 0 1 hours, respectively At one-month followup, transthoracic echocardiography revealed nine\npatients (8 0%) with greater than or equal to grade 2\nmitral regurgitation and six (5 4%) of these had reoperations (five replacements, one repair) There were no\ndeaths, strokes, or device-related complications This\nstudy demonstrated that multiple surgical teams could\nperform robotic mitral valve surgery safely early in the\ndevelopment of this technique **7 **7 Robotics in Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery**\n\nIn May 1998, Mohr and Falk harvested the left internal\nmammary artery (LIMA) with the da Vinci system and\nperformed the first human coronary anastomosis through\na small left anterior thoracotomy incision (Mohr _et al _,\n1999; Falk _et al _, 2000) More recently, work with da\nVinci has lead to FDA approval for internal mammary\nharvesting in the United States The first totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass\n(TECAB) was performed on an arrested heart at the\nBroussais Hospital in Paris using an early prototype of\nthe da Vinci system (Loulmet _et al _, 1999) The Leipzig\ngroup attempted a total closed chest approach for LIMA\nto left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD)\ngrafting on the arrested heart in 27 patients with da Vinci\nand was successful in 22 patients (Falk _et al _, 2000)",
    "_, 2000) Furthermore, surgeons in Europe improved the initial da\nVinci coronary bypass graft method and eventually were\nable to complete off-pump bilateral grafts of the internal\nmammary artery to the anterior descending and right\ncoronary arteries while working from one side of the\nchest (Aybek _et al _, 2000; Kappert _et al _, 2000) _, 2000) Experience with endoscopic coronary artery bypass\nsurgery has been limited to only a few centers and results\nare highly controlled Because the success of coronary\nsurgery depends on multiple, complex steps culminating\nin the creation of a vascular anastomosis, most clinical\nseries have introduced robotically assisted coronary\nsurgery in a stepwise fashion Specifically, initial\nexperience is limited to endoscopic LIMA harvesting,\nfollowed by a robotically assisted anastomosis through a\nmedian sternotomy Subsequently, a total endoscopic\nprocedure is performed on an arrested heart, and finally\nduring a beating heart operation Subsequently, a total endoscopic\nprocedure is performed on an arrested heart, and finally\nduring a beating heart operation Currently, the largest\npublished series of TECAB comes from Europe Wimmer-Greinecker’s group in Frankfurt, Germany,\n\n\n\nreported on 45 patients who underwent TECAB on an\narrested heart (Dogan _et al _, 2002) Most of these (82%)\nwere single-vessel bypass (either LIMA-LAD or right\ninternal mammary artery to right coronary artery) The\nfirst 22 patients had angiograms prior to discharge,\nrevealing a 100% patency rate Mean operative time was\n4 2 ± 0 2 ± 0 9 hours for single-vessel TECAB and 6 3 ± 1 3 ± 1 0\nhours for double-vessel bypass procedures The average\ncross-clamp time was 61 ± 16 minutes for single bypass\nand 99 ± 55 minutes for double bypass The initial\nconversion rate of 22% decreased to 5% in the last\n\ntwenty patients, reflecting an obvious learning curve In the United States, Damiano and his colleagues\ninitiated a multicenter clinical trial on robotically assisted\ncoronary surgery using the Zeus system (Damiano _et al _,\n2000)",
    "_,\n2000) In this FDA safety and efficacy trial, 19 patients\nunderwent a median sternotomy with cardioplegic arrest\nof the heart All grafts were hand sewn in a traditional\nmanner except the LIMA-LAD, which was robotically\nsewn Seventeen patients had adequate intraoperative\nflow (mean 38 5 ± 5 mL/min) in the LIMA graft Anastomotic time was 22 5 ± 1 2 minutes 2 minutes One patient\nunderwent re-exploration for mediastinal hemorrhage At\neight weeks follow-up, angiography showed that all\ngrafts were patent The average hospital stay was 4 The average hospital stay was 4 1 ±\n0 4 days 4 days Boyd and associates from London Health\nSciences Center in Ontario, Canada, have also been\nextensively involved in initial endoscopic coronary\nsurgery trials with the Zeus system In 2000, they\npublished a series of six patients that were the first to\nundergo TECAB in North America on a beating heart\nusing a specialized endoscopic stabilizer (Boyd _et al _,\n2000) _,\n2000) Each of these patients had single vessel LAD\ndisease and underwent LIMA-LAD grafting Special 8-0\npolytetrafluoroethylene suture 7 cm in length was used to\nminimize the time required for suture placement Intracoronary shunts were used to provide needle depth\nlandmark when performing endoscopic anastomosis with\ntwo-dimensional cameras Intracoronary shunts were used to provide needle depth\nlandmark when performing endoscopic anastomosis with\ntwo-dimensional cameras LIMA harvest time averaged\n65 3 ± 17 6 minutes (range 50-91 minutes) The\nanastomotic time was 55 8 ± 13 5 minutes (range 40-74\nminutes) and median operative time was 6 hours (range\n4 5-7 5 hours)",
    "5 hours) All patients had angiographically\nconfirmed patent grafts before leaving the hospital The\naverage hospital length of stay was 4 The\naverage hospital length of stay was 4 0 ± 0 9 days **8 Conclusion**\n\nThe early clinical experience with computer-enhanced\ntelemanipulation systems has defined many of the\nlimitations of this approach despite rapid procedural\nsuccess Currently, the lack of force feedback is being\naddressed and a strain sensor is being incorporated into\nadvanced robotic surgical tools and may soon allow\nmore control of force applied at the robotic end-effector\n(Zenati, 2001) Furthermore, conventional suture and\nknot tying add significant time to each procedure Technologic advancements, such as the use of nitinol Uclips (Coalescent Surgical Inc Technologic advancements, such as the use of nitinol Uclips (Coalescent Surgical Inc , Sunnyvale, CA) (Fig , Sunnyvale, CA) (Fig 5)\ninstead of sutures requiring manual knot tying, should\n\n\n91\n\n\ndecrease operative times significantly Besides advances in surgical technology, the potential\nuse of image-guided surgical technologies will provide\nreal-time data acquisition of physiologic characteristics,\nallowing one to better assess the delivery of remote\npercutaneous therapy Imaging techniques may include\nthree-dimensional modeling and reconstruction from\ncomputerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging,\nor ultrasound Fig 5 Nitinol U-clips Recently published research conducted at the National\nResearch Institute in Computer Science and Control of\nFrance, in collaboration with Professor Carpentier,\nfocuses on simulating and planning robotic procedures\n(Blondel _et al , 2002_ ) , 2002_ ) Computer modeling of organs\nsuch as the heart is generated from combined\ninformation from different imaging modalities A\nsurgeon may visualize and manipulate simulated objects\ninteractively and once optimal access port placements are\ndetermined, the positions of the simulated tools can be\nrecorded and marked directly on the patient to specify\npositions for port incisions This technology should\nenable and facilitate totally endoscopic robotic cardiac\noperations and benefit the patient through decreased risks\nand fewer adverse operative outcomes",
