    "A simple method for the determination of slowly varying refractive index profiles\nfrom in situ spectrophotometric measurements\n\n\nD A simple method for the determination of slowly varying refractive index profiles\nfrom in situ spectrophotometric measurements\n\n\nD Poitras and L Poitras and L Martinu [∗]\n\nGroupe de Recherche en Physique et Technologie des Couches Minces (GCM) and Department of Engineering Physics, Ecole [´]\nPolytechnique, Box 6079, Station Centre-Ville, Montr´eal (Qc), Canada H3C 3A7\n(November 26, 2024)\n\n\nReliable control of the deposition process of optical films and coatings frequently requires monitoring of the refractive index profile throughout the layer In the present work a simple in situ\napproach is proposed which uses a WKBJ matrix representation of the optical transfer function of a\nsingle thin film on a substrate Mathematical expressions are developed which represent the minima\nand maxima envelopes of the curves transmittance-vs-time and reflectance-vs-time The refractive\nindex and extinction coefficient depth profiles of different films are calculated from simulated spectra\nas well as from experimental data obtained during PECVD of silicon-compound films Variation of\nthe deposition rate with time is also evaluated from the position of the spectra extrema as a function\nof time The physical and mathematical limitations of the method are discussed The physical and mathematical limitations of the method are discussed I I INTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn optical coatings, two different kinds of graded index\nprofiles can occur: (i) intentionally graded profile, when\nprecisely controlled inhomogeneous optical coatings (for\nexample, rugate filters) are produced; [1] (ii) accidentally\ncreated inhomogeneities that may arise from the instability of the deposition process The latter may be due\nto different factors, [2][,][3] including the change of microstructure of the film deposited, the contamination, the lack of\ncontrol of the fabrication parameters, or the interaction\nof the growing film with the substrate In order to control the film quality it is, therefore,\nvery important to calculate the refractive index depth\nprofiles from in situ measurements Bovard, [4] inspired by\nthe popular transmittance envelope method for the calculation of refractive index dispersion curves, [5] [–] [7] developed\nan approximative method based on the transmittance envelopes of the curve transmittance-vs-time In this work,\nwe describe a generalized reflectance and transmittance\nenvelope method based on WKBJ approximation A matrix representation of thin films with slowly varying index\nof refraction is used to obtain maxima and minima enve\nlope expressions, which are then analytically solved and\nthe refractive index profile is extracted We apply this\nmethod to evaluate the uniformity of the refractive index\nin amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiN 1 3 ) films\ndeposited in low pressure plasma II EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\n\n\nBefore we present the theoretical background of our\ncalculations, we first describe the experimental method\n\n∗ author to whom correspondence should be addressed;\nelectronic-mail: lmartinu@mail polymtl ca\n\n\n\nology for the preparation of optical films The films studied in this work were grown on a radiofrequency (13 56\nMHz) -powered electrode (18 cm in diameter) in a plasma\nsystem (Fig",

(ii) once a material is deposited,\nits refractive index value is not altered by the following\ndeposition on top of it; (iii) the substrate is considered\nsemi-infinite, which means that the contribution to the\nreflectance from the back side is negligible ˘ ˘\nwith ǫ = −1 for n in - |n s |, ǫ = +1 for n in < |n s |, and\nη = 1 for n [2] in [> n] [0] [|][n][˘] [s] [|][,][ η][ =][ −][1 for][ n] [2] in [< n] [0] [|][n][˘] [s] [|][ ]\n\n\n2 Reflectance\n\n\nThe solution to the inverse problem, i e finding the\nvariation of the optical parameters with depth from\nEq (3), consists of solving the following minima and\nmaxima envelopes relations for three unknowns r in, r out\nand A:\n\n\nR min = [r] out [2] [−] [2][ǫr] [out] [ℜ][(˘][r] [in] [)][A][ +][ |][r][˘] [in] [|] [2] [A] [2] (7)\n\n1 − 2ǫr out ℜ(˘r in )A + r out [2] [|][r][˘] [in] [|] [2] [A] [2] [,]\n\nR max = [r] out [2] [+ 2][ǫr] [out] [ℜ][(˘][r] [in] [)][A][ +][ |][r][˘] [in] [|] [2] [A] [2] (8)\n\n1 + 2ǫr out ℜ(˘r in )A + r out [2] [|][r][˘] [in] [|] [2] [A] [2] [ ]\n\n\nHere, ℜ(˘r in ) is the real part of ˘r in The system of Eqs (7)\nand (8) offers only two equations Therefore, to solve\nit we assume that at the first stage of the deposition\n(d → 0), the film is homogeneous (n out → n in ) and transparent (A → 1) Using this approximation, and solving\nfor n in, we find\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\nN r = [(][ǫ][ + 1)][R] [min] [ −] [(][ǫ][ −] [1)][R] [max] [ + 2]\n\n(ǫ − 1)R max − (ǫ + 1)R min + 2 [ ]\n\n\n\n1/2\n�\n\n\n\n�N r [2] − [n] s [2] n [+] [2] s [ k] s [2]\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\nKeeping the value of n in constant, and solving for r out\nand for A when d > 0, the calculated solutions are as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nn in = [√] n 0 n s\n\n\n\nN r + η\n\n�\n\n\n\n, (9)\n\n\n\n1/2\n\n[B]\n\nA [−] [ζC][)] [2]\n�\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n[B]\n\nA [−] [ζC][)][ −] 2 [1]\n\n\n\nr out (z) = −\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n− [1]\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n\n2 [(] [B] A\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n−\n4 + ( [B]\n\n\n\n, (10)\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n(1 − r out [4] [)(][R] [max] [−] [R] [min] [)]\nA(z) = 1/2 (11)\nǫr out ℜ(˘r in ) [r out [2] [(2][R] [min] [R] [max] [−] [R] [max] [−] [R] [min] [) + (2][ −] [R] [min] [−] [R] [max] [)];]\n\n\nA = |r˘ in | [2] (R max − R min ) [2],\n\nB = 2ℜ(˘r in ) [2] (2 − R max − R min )(2R min R max − R min − R max ),\n\n\n\nA [,]\n\n\n\nC =\n\n\n\n�\n\n\n\n2 + [B] [2]\n\n\n\n\n[B] [2]\n\nA [2] [ −] [D] A\n\n\n\n˘\nD = −2|r in | [2] (R max − R min ) [2] + 8ℜ(˘r in ) [2] [ �] (R max + R min ) [2] + 2(1 − R max − R min )\n\n\n\n+2R max [2] [R] min [2]\n\n\n\n1 1\n� R min + R max − 1��,\n\n\n\n+1 if [1 +][ r] out [4] - [B]\nr out [2] A [,]\n\n\n−1 if [1 +][ r] out [4] < [B]\nr out [2] A [ ]\n\n\n\nζ =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe refractive index profile n out (z) is then calculated\nfrom n out = n 0 (1 − r out )/(1 + r out ) To illustrate the method with an example, we applied the above expressions to the envelopes surrounding the simulated spectra of a 1-µm-thick transparent\n(k = 0) layer with a linear profile and a deposition rate of\n60 nm/min (Fig 3)",
    "3) The profiles are expressed as a function of time instead of distance z, to simulate the type\nof data obtained experimentally with an optical monitor The calculated profile in Fig 3(b), although clearly\napproximate, is in very good agreement with the model\nlinear profile used in the simulation B Extinction coefficient profile\n\n\nCalculation of k(z) from A(z) in Eq (6) or (11) is done\nusing the following relation:\n\n\nd\n\nk(z) = [−][λ] (12)\n\n4π dz [ln][ A][(][z][)][ ]\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the A(z) profile obtained from the envelopes of Fig 3(a) The corresponding extinction coefficient profile is shown in Fig 4(b) One can see that small\ndeviations of A(z) from 1 (the value it should have) have\nstrong impact on the value of the calculated extinction\ncoefficient, which may reach unexpected negative values Therefore, experimental precision of the envelopes must\nbe very high if one is to find reliable k values C Deposition rate and physical position in the layer\n\n\nIt is interesting to express the results in Figs 3 and 4\nas a function of physical position inside the layer instead\nof deposition time When the deposition rate is constant\nduring the deposition, the transformation of the results\nas a function of thickness is obvious Unfortunately, it\nmay not be the case for numerous experiments If the\ndeposition rate varies during the deposition, one can still\nuse the fact that the optical thickness between two successive extrema is equal to a quarterwave Using the\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nd\nrelation mλ/4 = � 0 [n][(][z][)][dz][ (m is an integer representing]\nthe interference order) and assuming that the deposition\nrate is constant between successive extrema, one obtains\nthe following relation:\n\n\n\nthe layer (see Fig 5(b))",
    "5(b)) It appears that variation of the\ncalculated deposition rate around its overall mean value\nis negligible and that total thickness found is consistent\nwith the expected value of 1 µm It appears that variation of the\ncalculated deposition rate around its overall mean value\nis negligible and that total thickness found is consistent\nwith the expected value of 1 µm D Error calculus\n\n\n1 Transmittance\n\n\nA good estimate of the error in determining the n(z)\nand A(z) values may be obtained from the calculation of\nthe derivatives of Eqs (4)–(6) In the case of the transmittance, assuming that n s is known precisely and that\nthe error of T max and T min are the same and not related,\nwe have\n\n\n\nλ\n4 [≈] [z] t 2 [2] − [ −] t [z] 1 [1]\n\n\n\nt 2\n\nn(t)dt, (13)\n\n� t 1\n\n\n\nwhere z 1, z 2 and t 1, t 2 correspond to the positions of two\nsuccessive extrema on the thickness (distance) and time\nscales, respectively The relationship between the time\nand distance scales can be obtained from t 1 = 0 (z 1 = 0),\nwhere the first extremum occurs Figure 5(a) shows the\ncalculated evolution of the deposition rate from the simulation in Fig Figure 5(a) shows the\ncalculated evolution of the deposition rate from the simulation in Fig 3 3 The deposition rate varies around the\nexpected value (60 nm/min) within an interval of plus\nor minus 4 nm/min One can hence calculate the relation between the deposition time axis and the distance in\n\n\n\n∆n in (n [2] in [−] [n] [2] 0 [)(][n] s [2] [−] [n] [2] in [)]\n\n≈\nn in ���� 2(n 0 n s + n [2] in [)(][n] [0] [n] [s] [ −] [n] [2] in [)]\n\n\n\n����\n\n\n\n∆T\n\n(14)\n\n� T [,]\n\n\n\n∆T\n� T\n\n\n\nT max + T min\n� T max − T min\n\n\n\n1 + C n [2]\n\n\n\n∆n out\n\n\n\n\n[T] [max] [ +][ T] [min] ) [∆][T]\n\nT max − T min T\n\n\n\nn out\n\n≈ ( [T] [max] [ +][ T] [min]\nn out T max − T min\n\n\n\n\n[T] n 0 C n\n\n+\nT �1 +\n\n\n\nn [2] in [+][ n] s [2] ∆n in\n����� n [2] in [−] [n] s [2] ���� n in\n\n\n\n(15)\n�\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\nSimilarly:\n\n\n\nC n = 2n in n s\n���� n [2] in [−] [n] s [2]\n\n\n\n����\n\n\n\nT max − T min\n� T max T min (16)\n�\n\n\n\nA\n\n≈ [2][√][T] [max] [T] [min]\nA T T\n\n\n\n∆A\n\n\n\n∆T\n\n\n\n∆n out 2n s n in\n\n+\nn out ���� n [2] in [−] [n] s [2]\n\n\n\n∆n in (17)\n\n���� n in\n\n\n\nT max − T min\n\n\n\nT\n\n+ [2][n] [0] [n] [out]\nT n [2] [−] [n]\n\n\n\nn [2] out [−] [n] [2] 0\n\n\n\n2 Reflectance\n\n\nExpressions for the error in the envelope reflectance\nmethod can be found from the derivation of Eqs (9)–\n(11) as functions of R and n in The resulting equations\nare not shown here, but have been used for the determination of the error bars in the figures appearing in this\nwork (see Figs 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9)",

    "DISCUSSION\n\n\nA Experimental error\n\n\nOne must be very careful when using an optical monitor for the quasi-continuous measurement of transmittance or reflectance with time in a plasma environment For measurements at a single wavelength in a glow discharge, use of a lock-in detection system would help to\nsubtract the light generated by plasma In our case, with\na photodiode array, such light chopping was not used In\naddition, it was found that the main source of experimental error was the reflection and the scattering of light on\ndifferent metallic components in the deposition chamber Those were suppressed by installing a diaphragm between\nthe optical monitor and the sample, and by blackening\nthe surface of the sample holder Such perturbations will\nhardly change the phase information of the signal, but\nthey can have a significant effect on the signal amplitude B WKBJ approximation limitations\n\n\nAs pointed out in Sec III, the matrix representation\nin Eq (1) follows the WKBJ approximation, which holds\nwhen\n\n1 1\n≪ (18)\n���� n [2] (z) [∇][n][(][z][)] ���� λ [ ]\n\n\nThe method has been tested on simulated envelopes obtained from a slightly more complex refractive index profile Figure 9(a) shows the model profile used and the calculated profile, while Fig 9(b) shows an evaluation of the\nleft (solid line) and right (dashed line) part of Eq (18) One can see that the relation (18) holds throughout the\nprofile Consequently, the WKBJ approximation is valid\nfor these profiles, like it is for the other less complex linear profiles studied in this work C Envelopes-related limitations\n\n\nPrecise determination of the envelopes from experimental spectra is delicate Algorithms for finding envelopes were developed and are used for the determination of refractive index dispersion from ex situ spectrophotometric measurements [11][,][12] In these cases, the\nspectra and its envelopes are functions of wavelength instead of time or distance, so that limit conditions at the\nright and left sides of the spectra can be used in order\nto improve the accuracy of the envelope computed",
    "[11][,][12] In these cases, the\nspectra and its envelopes are functions of wavelength instead of time or distance, so that limit conditions at the\nright and left sides of the spectra can be used in order\nto improve the accuracy of the envelope computed No\nsuch limit conditions exist in our case No\nsuch limit conditions exist in our case Consequently,\nsimple cubic or linear spline has been chosen to compute\nthe envelopes As a result, the left and right extremes\nof the spectra are more likely to generate errors in the\ncalculus In addition, to increase the accuracy of the envelopes, the layer must reach a minimum thickness, so\n\n\n\nthat the spectra show at least 3 extrema The value of\nthis minimum thickness will depend on the index of the\nfilm and substrate materials used, and on the wavelength\nof the probing light The shorter the wavelength, the\nsmaller the minimum thickness will be Once such minimum thickness is reached, the method can be used to\nfollow, in real time, the evolution of the refractive index\nprofile during the film growth Once such minimum thickness is reached, the method can be used to\nfollow, in real time, the evolution of the refractive index\nprofile during the film growth D Change of sign of ζ within the layer\n\n\nIn Sec III, the sign parameters ǫ, η and ζ can all reach\nvalues of +1 or -1, depending on the different values of\nthe refractive index of the substrate and of the film The\nformer two are easy to determine, as they depend only on\nthe values of n s and n in, and do not depend on z The\nlatter one (ζ) can be more difficult to determine since\nits value depends on n out (z) and is changing along the\nprofile Figure 10 illustrates the effect of a change in\nthe sign of ζ on the refractive index profile: Similarly\nto Fig 3, a linear profile (dashed line) has been used to\nsimulate the variation with time of the reflectance during\nthe deposition of the graded layer The envelope method\ndeveloped above has been used to calculate the refractive index profile twice, i e with ζ value of +1 and -1,\nrespectively",
    "with ζ value of +1 and -1,\nrespectively Around t ≈ 7 min , the variation of r out,\nR min and R max is such that the value of ζ in Eq (10)\nshould be changed from -1 to +1 in order to calculate an\naccurate refractive index profile E Ex situ analysis\n\n\nFor comparison additional ex situ spectrophotometric and spectroellipsometric analysis of samples from\nSec IV have been performed Using the n(z) profile\nfor SiN 1 3 layer on glass calculated with the envelope\nmethod (Fig 6), cutting this profile in small sublayers,\nand introducing a small n(λ) dispersion, it was found\nthat the reflectance calculated from this profile reproduce well the ex situ measured reflectance (Fig 11(b))\nand the in situ measured reflectance (Fig 11(c)) In addition, a simple model considering a single homogeneous\nlayer (dotted line in Fig 11(a)) has been used to reproduce more precisely the ex situ reflectance (Fig 11(b)); it\nwas found that this model gives almost the same in situ\nreflectance variation with time (Fig 11(c)) as the graded\nprofile (solid line in Fig 11(a)) However, the ex situ\nspectra provide very little information about the exact\nindex profile; in fact, different changes in the thickness\nand the n(z) values of the graded profile in Fig 11(a)\ncould also result in a good match with the ex situ data\nin Fig 11(b) Therefore, ex situ measurements do not\noffer enough reliable informations about the real profile\nn(z) Ex situ spectroellipsometric measurements led to\nthe same observations One can conclude that: (i) ex\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nsitu analysis can give a false impression of homogeneity,\ndue to the fact that several different models can fit ex\nsitu data (there are several local minima of the merit\nfunction used in the fitting procedure); (ii) in situ analysis using the envelope method proposed in this work\navoids fitting problems, but small errors in the experimental data can lead to large uncertainties in the n(z)\nand k(z) profiles The advantage of in situ measurements\nis clear (“it’s easier to investigate a murder if you can see\nit in situ” [13] ), but finding n(z) very precisely requires very\nsensitive measurements VI CONCLUSION\n\n\nAn envelope method has been developed for the determination of refractive index profile n(z) from in situ\nspectrophotometric measurements (reflectance or transmittance) The method is based on the WKBJ approximation valid for slowly varying refractive index profiles Generalized analytical expressions, suitable for high or\nlow index substrates, are given for the calculation of n(z)\nfrom in situ transmittance measurements A more generalized solution, valid also for non-transparent substrates\nwas calculated and it is used for the determination of\nn(z) from in situ reflectance measurements The instantaneous deposition rate and its variation during the deposition process are derived from the calculated n(z) profile The main feature of the envelope method developed in\nthis work is its analytical character: Unlike usual in situ\nspectrophotometric and ellipsometric analysis, no nonlinear fit algorithms or “initial guess” of the refractive\nindex has to be used in order to ascertain n(z) In fact,\nthe simplicity of this envelope method makes it attractive\nfor rapid first approximation analysis to generate initial\ndata for more sophisticated methods such as in situ ellipsometry ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n\nThe authors are indebted to Mr Gilles Jalbert and\nto Mr Jiri Cerny for their technical assistance with the\nexperiments This work was supported in part by the\nFCAR of Quebec and by the NSERC of Canada",
