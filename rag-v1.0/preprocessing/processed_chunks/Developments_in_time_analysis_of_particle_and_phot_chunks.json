(2) averaging over an introduced\n\n\nset of kinematics paths, distribution of which is supposed to describe the particle motion\n\n\ninside the barrier; (3) introducing a new degree of freedom, constituting a physical clock for\n\n\nmeasurements of tunnelling times Separately, by one’s self, the dwell time stands The last\n\n\nhas ab initio the presumptive meaning of the time that the incident flux has to be turned\n\n\non, to provide the accumulated particle storage in the barrier [5,36] The first group contains the so–called phase times, firstly mentioned in [3,4] and applied\n\n\nto tunnelling in [48,49], the times of the motion of wave–packet spatial centroids, earlier\n\n\nconsidered for general quantum collisions in [13,14] and applied to tunnelling in [50,51],\n\n\nand finally the Olkhovsky–Recami (O–R) method [35,52,53] of averaging over unidirectional\n\n\nfluxes, basing on the representation of time as a quantum–mechanical observable and on the\n\n\ngeneralization of the definitions,introduced in [7,25,26] for atomic and nuclear collisions The\n\n\nsecond group contains methods, utilizing the Feynman path integrals [54–57], the Wigner\n\n\ndistribution paths [58,59] and the Bohm approach [60] To the third group the approaches\n\n\nwith the Larmor clock [61] and the oscillatory barrier [62,63] pertain Certainly the basic self–consistent definition of tunnelling durations (mean values, vari\n\nances of distributions and so on) has to be elaborated quite similarly to the definitions of\n\n\nother physical quantities (distances, energies, momenta, etc ,) on the base of utilizing all\n\n\nnecessary properties of time as a quantum–physical observable (time operator, canonically\n\n\nconjugated to energy operator; the equivalency of the averaged quantities in time and energy\n\n\nrepresentations with adequate measures, or weights, of averaging) Since the representation\n\n\nof solutions of the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation as moving wave packets is typical\n\n\nand the most self–consistent in quantum collision theory (see, for instance, [6, ref 3], it is\n\n\n3\n\n\nnatural to apply the wave–packet description Then one can hope that in the framework\n\n\nof the conventional quantum mechanics every known definition of tunnelling times can be\n\n\nshown, after appropriate analysis, to be (at least in the asymptotic region, used for typical\n\n\nboundary conditions in quantum collision theory) either a particular case of the general def\n\ninition or an equivalent one or the definition which is valid not for tunnelling but for some\n\n\naccompanying process, different from tunnelling Here such a definition with the necessary formalism is presented (Sec 2) and, without\n\n\nclaiming to present the exhaustive analysis of all known definitions, then analysis of various\n\n\napproaches is given (Sec 3–5), basing on the O–R formalism In Sec 6 some peculiarities of\n\n\ntunnelling evolution revealed by use of the O–R method are presented, then, after Sec 7,\n\n\nthere is a short note on the reshaping (and reconstructing) phenomenon in connection with a\n\n\npossible formulation of relativistic causality in the cases of superluminal effective tunnelling\n\n\nvelocities (Sec 8) and finally in Sec 9 some conclusions and reasonings on nearest prospects\n\n\nare presented II THE OLKHOVSKY–RECAMI FORMALISM OF DEFINING TUNNELLING\n\n\nDURATIONS, BASED ON UTILIZING PROPERTIES OF TIME AS A\n\n\nQUANTUM–MECHANICAL OBSERVABLE AND THE WAVE–PACKET\n\n\nDESCRIPTION We confine ourselves to the simplest case of particles moving only along the x–direction,\n\n\nand consider a time–independent barrier in the interval (0, a); see Fig 1, in which a larger\n\n\ninterval (x i, x f ), containing the barrier region, is also indicated Following the definition of\n\n\ncollision durations, put forth in [7,23,25,26] and generalized in [35,52,54], we can eventually\n\n\ndefine the mean values of the time at which a particle passes through position x, travelling\n\n\nin the positive or negative direction of the x–axis, and the variances of the distributions of\n\n\nthese times, respectively, as\n\n\n4\n\n\n< t ± (x) > =\n\n\n\n� −∞+∞\n\n\n\n−∞ [tJ] [±] [(][x, t][) d][x]\n\n+∞\n\nJ ± (x, t) dx\n\n� −∞\n\n\n\n−∞+∞ (1)\n\nJ ± (x, t) dx\n\n−∞\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nD t ± (x) =\n\n\n\n� −∞+∞\n\n\n\n� −∞ [t] [2] [J] [±] [(][x, t][) d][x]\n\n\n+∞\n\nJ ± (x, t) dx\n\n� −∞\n\n\n\n−∞+∞ − [< t ± (x) >] [2] (2)\n\nJ ± (x, t) dx\n\n−∞\n\n\n\nwhere J ± (x, t) = Re[(ih/m¯ )(Ψ(x, t))(∂Ψ [∗] (x, t)/∂x)] being the probability flux density for an\n\n\nevolving wave packet Ψ(x, t) We recall here the equivalence of time and energy represen\n\ntations, with appropriate measures of averaging, in the following sense: < > t =< > E\n\n\n(index t is omitted in all expression for < > t for the sake of the simplicity) This equiva\n\nlence is a consequence of the time–operator existence So, we have a formalism for defining\n\n\nmean values, variances and other central moments related to the duration distributions of\n\n\nall possible kinds of collisions and interactions with arbitrary energies, including tunnelling For instance, for transmissions from region I to region III, we have\n\n\n< τ T (x i, x f ) >=< t + (x f ) > − < t + (x i ) > (3)\n\n\nDτ T (x i, x f ) = Dt + (x f ) − Dt + (x i ) (4)\n\n\nwith −∞ < x i ≤ 0 and a ≤ x f < ∞ For a pure tunnelling process one has\n\n\n< τ tun (0, a) >=< t + (a) > − < t + (0) > (5)\n\n\nand\n\n\nDτ tun (0, a) = Dt + (a) + Dt + (0) (6)\n\n\nSimilar expression we have for the penetration (into the barrier region II) temporal\n\n\nquantities < τ pen (x i, x f ) > and Dτ pen (x i, x f ) with 0 < x f < a For reflections in any point\n\n\nx f ≤ a one has\n\n\n< τ R (x i, x f ) >=< t − (x f ) > − < t + (x i ) > (7)\n\n\n5\n\n\nand\n\n\nDτ R (x i, x f ) = Dt − (x f ) + Dt + (x i ) (8)\n\n\nWe stress that these definitions hold within the framework of conventional quantum\n\n\nmechanics, without introducing any new physical postulate In the asymptotic cases, when |x i | >> a,\n\n\n< τ T [as] [(][x] [i] [, x] [f] [)][ >][=][< t][(][x] [f] [)][ >] [T] [−] [< t][(][x] [i] [)][ >] [in] (9)\n\n\nand\n\n\n< τ T [as] [(][x] [i] [, x] [f] [)][ >][=][< τ] [T] [(][x] [i] [, x] [f] [)][ >][ +][ < t] [+] [(][x] [i] [)][ >][ −] [< t] [+] [(][x] [i] [)][ >] [in] (10)\n\n\nwhere < > T and < > in denote averagings over the fluxes corresponding to ψ T =\n\n\nA T exp(ikx) and ψ in = exp(ikx) respectively For initial wave packets\n\n\n∞\nΨ in (x, t) = G(k − k) exp[ikx − iEt/h¯)dE\n� 0\n\n\n(where E = ¯h [2] k [2] /2m;

our definition of the mean duration of any such process is, by\n\n\nno means, based on the assumption that the centroid (or peak) of the incident wave packet\n\n\ndirectly evolves into the centroid (or peak) of the transmitted and reflected packets, as it was\n\n\nerroneously claimed in [65], but does simply signify the difference between the mean time\n\n\nvalues of the passing of the final and initial wave packets through the appropriate points,\n\n\nregardless of any intermediate motion, transformation and reshaping of these wave packets And for any collision (and so on) processes, as a whole, one can test the causality condition However, there is no unique general formulation of the causality condition, necessary and\n\n\nsufficient for all possible cases of collisions (and not only for nonrelativistic wave packets,\n\n\nbut also for relativistic ones) The simplest (or the most strong) nonrelativistic causality\n\n\ncondition implies the non–negative values of the mean durations However, this is a suffi\n\ncient but not the necessary causality condition Negative times (advance phenomena) were\n\n\nrevealed even near nuclear resonances, distorted by the non–resonant background (see, in\n\n\nparticular, [26] ); similarly, advance phenomena can occur at the beginning of tunnelling (see\n\n\nSec 6) Generally speaking, the complete causality condition can be connected not only with\n\n\n8\n\n\nthe mean time duration but also with other temporal properties of the considered process For example, the following variant of the causality condition seems to be somewhat more\n\n\nrealistic: the difference between the effective starts of final and initial fluxes is non–negative,\n\n\nthe effective start being defined as the difference between the mean instant of wave–packet\n\n\npassing through the appropriate point and the square root of the corresponding instant–\n\n\ndistribution variance And also this condition is only sufficient but not necessary because in\n\n\nmany realistic cases wave packets have infinite and not very rapidly decreasing forward tails Much more realistic formulations of the causality conditions for wave packets with infinite\n\n\ntails are presented in Sec",

    "]\n\n\nV ANALYSIS OF THE MEAN TUNNELLING TIMES, DEFINED BY\n\n\nAVERAGING OVER KINEMATIC PATHS The Feynman path–integral approach to quantum mechanics was applied in [54–57] to\n\n\nstudy and calculate the mean tunnelling time averaged over all paths, that have the same\n\n\nbeginning and end, with the complex weight factor exp[iS(x(t)/h¯], where S is the action\n\n\nassociated with the path x(t) Namely such weighting of tunnelling times implies their\n\n\ndistribution with a real and an imaginary components [36] In [54] the real and imaginary\n\n\n12\n\n\nparts of the obtained complex tunnelling time were found to be equal to τ y,tun [La] [and][ −][τ] z,tun [ La]\n\n\nrespectively An interesting development of this approach, the instanton version, is presented in [57] The instanton–bounce path is a stationary point of the Euclidean action The latter is\n\n\nobtained by the analytic continuation to imaginary time in the Feynman path–integrals\n\n\ncontaining the factor exp(iS/h¯) This path obeys a classical equation of motion in the\n\n\npotential barrier with the sign reversed In [57] the instanton bounces were considered as a\n\n\nreal physical processes The bounce duration was calculated in real time and was found to be\n\n\nin good agreement with the one evaluated by the phase–time method The temporal density\n\n\nof bounces was estimated in imaginary time and the obtained result coincided with (13) for\n\n\nthe square root of the distribution variance at the limit of the phase–time approximation Here one can see a manifestation of the virtual equivalence of the Schr¨odinger representation\n\n\nand the Feynman path–integral approach to quantum mechanics Another definition of the tunnelling time is connected with the Wigner distribution paths\n\n\n[58,59] The basic idea of this approach, finally formulated by Muga, Brouard and Sala, is\n\n\nthat the distribution of the tunnelling times in the dynamical evolution of wave packets\n\n\nthrough barriers can be well approximated by a classical ensemble of particles with a certain\n\n\ndistribution function, namely the Wigner function f (x, p), so that the flux at position x can\n\n\nbe separated into positive and negative components:\n\n\nJ(x) = J [+] (x) + J [−] (x) (28)\n\n\nwith\n\n\n∞\nJ [+] (x) =\n� 0 [(][p/m][)][f] [(][x, p][)d][p]\n\n\nand J [−] = J − J [+] Then formally the same expressions (3), (5) and (7) for the transmission,\n\n\ntunnelling and penetration durations and so on, as in the O–R formalism, were obtained with\n\n\nthe substitution of J [±] instead of our J ± The dwell time decomposition in this approach\n\n\ntakes the form\n\n\n13\n\n\n< τ [dw] (x i, x f ) >=< T > E < τ T (x i, x f ) > + < R M (x i ) > E < τ R (x i, x i ) > (29)\n\n\nwith R M (x) = � 0∞ [|][J] [−] [(][x, t][)][|][d][t][ Asymptotically][ R] [M] [(][x][) tends to][ < R >] [E] [ and (29) takes]\n\n\nformally the known form (22) One more alternative is the stochastic method for wave packets [69] It also leads to real\n\n\ntimes but its numerical implementation is not trivial [59] In [60] the Bohm approach to quantum mechanics was used to choose a set of classical\n\n\npaths which do not cross The Bohm formulation can provide, on the one hand, a strict\n\n\nequivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation, and on the other hand, a base for the nonstandard\n\n\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics [36] The obtained expression in [60] for the mean dwell\n\n\ntime is not only positive definite but gives the unambiguous distinction between particles\n\n\nthat are transmitted or reflected:\n\n\n\n∞\nτ [dw] (x i, x f ) =\n� 0\n\n\n\n|Ψ(x, t)| [2] dx = Tτ T (x i, x f ) + Rτ R (x i, x i ) (30)\nx 1\n\n\n\n∞ x 2\n\ndt\n0 � x\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\n∞\nτ T (x i, x f ) =\n� 0\n\n\n\n|Ψ(x, t)| [2] Θ(x − x c )dx/T, (31)\nx 1\n\n\n\n∞ x 2\n\ndt\n0 � x\n\n\n\n∞\nτ R (x i, x f ) =\n� 0\n\n\n\n|Ψ(x, t)| [2] Θ(x c − x)dx/R, (32)\nx 1\n\n\n\n∞ x 2\n\ndt\n0 � x\n\n\n\nwhere T and R are, here, the mean transmission and reflection probability respectively, the\n\n\nbifurcation line x c = x c (t), separating transmitted and reflected trajectories, is defined by\n\n\nrelation\n\n\n+∞\nT =\n\n(33)\n\n� −∞ [|][Ψ(][x, t][)][|] [2] [Θ(][x][ −] [x] [c] [)d][x ]\n\n\nFactually, in addition to the difference in the temporal integration in this and our formalism\n\n\n( � 0∞ and � −∞∞ [respectively), sometimes essential, this approach gives one more alternative in]\n\n\nseparating the flux by the line x c :\n\n\nJ(x, t) = [J(x, t)] T + [J(x, t)] R (34)\n\n\n14\n\n\nwith\n\n\n[J(x, t)] T = J(x, t)Θ[x − x c (t)],\n\n\n[J(x, t)] R = J(x, t)Θ[x c (t) − x] VI",
    "VI PECULIARITIES OF THE TUNNELLING EVOLUTION The results of calculations presented in [53], within the Olkhovsky–Recami formalism,\n\n\nshow that: (i) at variance with [70], no plot for the mean penetration duration of our wave\n\n\npackets presents any interval with negative values, nor with a decreasing for increasing x;\n\n\n(ii) the mean tunnelling duration does not depend on the barrier width a ( the Hartmann–\n\n\nFletcher effect); (iii) the quantity < τ tun (0, a) > decreases when the energy increases; (iv)\n\n\nthe value < τ pen (0, x) > rapidly increases for increasing x near x = 0 and tends to an almost\n\n\nsaturation value near x = a The results of calculations presented in [53], within the Olkhovsky–Recami formalism,\n\n\nshow that: (i) at variance with [70], no plot for the mean penetration duration of our wave\n\n\npackets presents any interval with negative values, nor with a decreasing for increasing x;\n\n\n(ii) the mean tunnelling duration does not depend on the barrier width a ( the Hartmann–\n\n\nFletcher effect); (iii) the quantity < τ tun (0, a) > decreases when the energy increases; (iv)\n\n\nthe value < τ pen (0, x) > rapidly increases for increasing x near x = 0 and tends to an almost\n\n\nsaturation value near x = a In Fig In Fig 2 the dependences of the values of < τ tun (0, a) > from a are presented for electronic\n\n\nwave packets and rectangular barriers with the same parameters as in [53] (V 0 = 10eV; mean\n\n\nelectron energies E = 2 5, 5, 7 5eV with ∆k = 0 02A [˚] [−][1] (curves 1a, 2a, 3a respectively); en\n\nergy E = 5eV with ∆k = 0 06A [˚] [−][1] (curves 4a, 5a respectively) ) The curves, corresponding\n\n\nto different energies and k, merge practically into one curve, 6 And since the dependence of\n\n\n< τ tun [ph] [>][ from][ a][ is very weak, the dependance of][ < τ] tun [(0][, a][)][ >][ from][ a][ is defined mainly by]\n\n\nthe dependence of < t + (0) > from a (curves 1b–5b) All these calculations manifest the neg\n\native value of < t + (0) > from a (see also [71]) Such “a–causal” advance can be interpreted as\n\n\na result of the superposition and interference of incoming and reflected waves: the reflected–\n\n\nwave packet extinguishes the back edge of the incoming–wave packet, and the larger is the\n\n\nbarrier width the larger is the part of the back edge of the incoming–wave packet which is\n\n\nextinguished by the superimposing reflected–wave packet, up to the saturation, when the\n\n\ncontribution of the reflected–wave packet becomes almost constant, independently from a 15\n\n\nBesides all < t + (0) > are negative and the values of < τ tun (0, a) > are always positive\n\n\nand, moreover, larger than < τ tun [ph] [>][, in accordance with (16) In connection with this, it]\n\n\nis relevant to note that the example with a classical ensemble of two particles (one with a\n\n\nlarge above–barrier energy and the other with a small sub–barrier energy), presented in [72],\n\n\ncontradicts to our results not only because that tunnelling is a pure quantum phenomenon\n\n\nwithout a direct classical limit but, first of all, because in [72] it is overlooked the fact that\n\n\nthe values of < t + (0) > are negative (for our initial condition) The last calculations of\n\n\nZaichenko [71] ( for the same parameters) have shown that such advance is noticeable also\n\n\nbefore the barrier front (however, only near the barrier wall) and, moreover, the values of\n\n\n< τ pen (x i, x f ) > are negative for x i = −a/5 and x f = 0, a/5, 2a/5 and a little larger values\n\n\nof x f inside the barrier But this result is not a–casual because the causality conditions (see\n\n\nrelations (47) and (48) in Sec 8) are fulfilled in this case VII",
    "VII ABOUT THE ANALOGY BETWEEN NONRELATIVISTIC PARTICLE\n\n\nAND PHOTON (ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE–PACKET) TUNNELLING The formal mathematical analogy between the time–dependent quantum equations for\n\n\nthe motion of relativistic particles and the time–dependent equation for electromagnetic\n\n\nwave propagation was studied in [73,74] Here, we shall deal with the comparison of the\n\n\nsolutions of the time–dependent Schr¨odinger equation for nonrelativistic particles and of\n\n\nthe time–dependent Helmholtz equation for electromagnetic waves, considering not only the\n\n\nformal mathematical analogy between them, but also such similarity of the probabilistic\n\n\ninterpretation of the wave function for a particle and of a classical electromagnetic wave\n\n\npacket, (being according to [75] the “wave function for a single photon”) which is sufficient\n\n\nfor the identical definition of mean time instants and durations (and distribution variances\n\n\nand so on) of propagation, collision, tunnelling,etc , processes for particles and photons [76] Concretely, we consider a hollow narrowed rectangular waveguide like depicted in Fig

polarization, nevertheless, in a certain sense, for the one–\n\n\ndimensional propagation, it is possible to use the space–time probabilistic interpretation of\n\n\n(39) along x–axis (the propagation direction) [81] Usually one uses not the probability\n\n\ndensity and the probability flux density with the corresponding continuity equation directly\n\n\nbut the energy density s 0 and the energy flux density s x (although, in general, they rep\n\nresent components of not a 4–dimensional vector but the energy–momentum tensor) with\n\n\nthe corresponding continuity equation [75] which we write in the two–dimensional (spatially,\n\n\none–dimensional) form:\n\n\n∂s 0 /∂t + ∂s x /∂x = 0 (40)\n\n\nwhere\n\n\ns 0 = [E [−→] [∗] [−→] E + H [−→] [∗] [−→] H ]/4π, s x = c[E [−→] [∗] [−→] H ] x /8π (41)\n\n\nand x–axis is directed along the motion direction (the mean momentum) of the wave packet\n\n\n(39) We stress that for the spatially one–dimensional propagation the energy–momentum\n\n\ntensor of the electromagnetic field reduces to the two–component quantity, scalar term s 0\n\n\nand 1–dimensional vector term s x, for which continuity equation (40) is Lorentz–invariant Then, as a normalization condition, one choose the equality of the spatial integrals of s 0 and\n\n\ns x to the mean photon energy and the mean photon momentum respectively or simply the\n\n\n18\n\n\nunit energy flux density s x With this, by passing the problem of the impossibility of the\n\n\ndirect space probabilistic interpretation of (39), we can define conventionally the

energy transport which was established for electromagnetic waves (at least, in the\n\n\ncase of usual plane waves) in [82] Hence, (i) in a certain sense, for time analysis along the\n\n\nmotion direction, the wave packet (39) is quite similar to a wave packet for nonrelativistic\n\n\nparticles and, (ii) similarly to the conventional nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, one can\n\n\ndefine the mean time of photon (electromagnetic wave packet) passing through point x [81]\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n∞\n< t(x) >=\n�\n\n\n\n−∞∞ [tJ] [em,x] [ d][t][ =] � −∞∞\n\n\n\n−∞∞ [tS] [x] [(][x, t][) d][t] � [�]

operator as for particles in nonrelativistic\n\n\nquantum mechanics and hence verify the equivalence of calculations of < t(x) >, Dt(x),\n\n\netc , in both time and energy representations) Then, one can use the same interpretation\n\n\nfor the propagation of electromagnetic wave packets (photons) in media and waveguides\n\n\nwhen collisions, reflections and tunnelling can take place In particular, for waveguides,like\n\n\ndepicted in Fig 3, with boundary conditions (36) and, decreasing and increasing waves when\n\n\nk x = γ = iχ em 19\n\n\nIn the case of fluxes which change their signs with time, we introduce, following [35,52,53],\n\n\nquantities J em,x,± = J em,x Θ(±J em,x ) with the same physical meaning as for particles There\n\nfore, expressions for mean values and variances of distributions of propagation, tunnelling,\n\n\ntransmission, penetration, and reflection durations can be obtained in the same way as in\n\n\nthe case of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics for particles (with the substitution of J by\n\n\nJ em ) In the particular case of quasi–monochromatic wave packets, using the stationary–\n\n\nphase method under the same boundary and measurement

    "This result agrees with the results of the microwave–\n\n\ntunnelling measurements presented in [39] (see also [40], where, moreover, the effective tun\n\nnelling velocity was identified with the group velocity of the final wave packet corresponding\n\n\nto a single photon) VIII A REMARK ON RESHAPING (RECONSTRUCTING) PHENOMENON The superluminal phenomena, observed in the experiments with tunnelling photons\n\n\nand evanescent electromagnetic waves [39–42], generated a lot of discussions on relativis\n\ntic causality And, in connection with this, also an interest for similar phenomena, observed\n\n\nfor the electromagnetic pulse propagation in a dispersive medium [83–85], was revived Al\n\nready for long there was ascertained that the wave–front velocity of the electromagnetic\n\n\npulse propagation, when pulses have a step–function envelope, cannot exceed the velocity\n\n\nof light c in vacuum [79,86] There, the signal velocity was also defined as the velocity\n\n\nof the propagation of the pulse main part in a medium which was shown to be less than\n\n\n20\n\n\nthe wave–front velocity These conclusions were confirmed by various methods and in var\n\nious processes, including tunnelling [74,87–91] In [79] the distinctions between the above\n\n\nmentioned velocities and the group velocity were also analyzed One of the argued problems consists in the absence of a step–function form of forward\n\n\nedges for realistic wave packets [74,91] In such cases the conclusions of [79] can seem to\n\n\nbe inapplicable Nevertheless an infinite but sufficiently rapidly decreasing forward edge of\n\n\na pulse can be cut off, with any desired degree of the accuracy, (defined, for instance, by\n\n\na sensitivity of registration devices or a chosen mathematical approximation), without an\n\n\nessential distortion of the pulse spectral expansion This can give a possibility to apply the\n\n\nconclusions of [79,86] But independently from these reasonings, one can search a principal\n\n\nunderstanding of cases with superluminal group velocities ( or effective velocities, like (46))\n\n\nwithout violations of special relativity or causality A possible way of such understanding can consist in explaining the superluminal phe\n\nnomena during tunnelling on the base of a pulse attenuated reshaping (or reconstructing)\n\n\ndiscussed at the classical limit earlier by [83–85] The later parts of an input pulse are prefer\n\nentially attenuated in such a way that the output peak appears shifted toward earlier times,\n\n\narising from the forward tail of the incident pulse in a strictly causal manner [40] In par\n\nticular, the following reasonable scheme is quite compatible with the usual idea of causality:\n\n\nif an overall pulse attenuation is very strong and, in the same case, during tunnelling, the\n\n\nleading edge of the pulse is less attenuated than the trailing edge, then, the time envelope\n\n\nof the out–coming final small flux can be totally under the temporal initial–flux envelope,\n\n\nwhich should pass through the same position if its motion were free in vacuum (see also the\n\n\ndiscussion in [92–94]) And, if the dependence of A T from energy is much more weak than\n\n\nthe dependence of the weight factor in an initial wave packet, the spectral expansion and\n\n\nhence the geometrical form of the transmitted wave packet will be practically undistorted in\n\n\ncomparison with the spectral expansion and the form of the initial wave packet (reshaping) But if the dependence of A T from energy is not weak, then the pulse form and width can\n\n\nbe noticeably changed (reconstruction) 21\n\n\nThe proposed scheme can be considered as a possible sufficient (but not necessary)\n\n\ncausality condition and one can try to formulate more general causality condition when the\n\n\ntemporal envelope of the final flux can even go out of the temporal envelope of the initial\n\n\npulse flowing through the same position Really, one can assume that the wave–packet\n\n\nspectral expansion and then the shape and width of the final pulse remain the same as for\n\n\nthe initial pulse (reshaping) And, if the dependence of A T from energy is not weak, then the\n\n\npulse form and width can be changed (reconstructing) For example, the following relation\n\n\nT\n\n(47)\n\n� −∞ [[][J] [in] [(][x] [f] [, t][)][ −] [J] [f,][+] [(][x] [f] [, t][) d][t][ ≥] [0][,][ −∞] [< T <][ ∞]\n\n\nis quite acceptable It does simply signify that during any semi–confined (from above) time\n\n\ninterval, an integral final flux (along any direction) does not exceed that integral flux which\n\n\nshould pass through the same position during the free motion (with the light velocity c for\n\n\nphotons) of the initial wave packet in vacuum, although, by the way, one can find such finite\n\n\nT 1 and T 2, (−∞ < T 1 < T 2 < ∞) for which\n\n\nT 2\n\n[J in (x f, t) − J f,+ (x f, t)] dt < 0 � T 1\n\n\nOne can also propose another causality condition:\n\n\n\n� T 0\n\n\n\n−∞ [J] [f,][+] [(][x] [f] [, t][) d][t]\n\n\n\n−∞T 0 [t J] [f,][+] [(][x] [f] [, t][) d][t] � [�] −∞T 0\n\n\n\n(48)\n\n\n\nT

of both fluxes after\n\n\nthe final–peak appearance Relation (48) does simply signify that there is a delay in the\n\n\naveraged appearance of the forward part of the final wave packet, in comparison with the\n\n\naveraged appearance of the forward part of that wave packet, which should pass through\n\n\nthe same position x f, during the free motion of the initial wave packet in vacuum The\n\n\nconditions (47) and (48) are much more general than the previous one The same relations\n\n\ncan be also used for the nonrelativistic causality conditions, with the only substitution of\n\n\nx f by x i in J in 22\n\n\nIt is curious that, without violating such causality, a certain undistorted information,\n\n\ncarried out by a low–frequency modulation of a high–frequency wave packet, can be trans\n\nmitted (however, with a strong attenuation) with a superluminal wave–packet group (or\n\n\neffective) velocity when attenuated reshaping takes place IX CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS\n\n\nI Now one can conclude that the basic quantum–physical formalism for determining the\n\n\ncollision and tunnelling times for nonrelativistic particles and for photons has been already,\n\n\nat least in principle, constructed: (1) there are self–consistent definitions of mean time in\n\nstants and time durations of various collision processes (including tunnelling) together with\n\n\nvariances of their distributions, based on utilizing the properties of time as a quantum–\n\n\nphysical observable (in quantum mechanics and in quantum electrodynamics), just similarly\n\n\nto other observables; (2) these definitions are functioning rather well, at least for asymptotic\n\n\ndistances between initial wave packets and interaction regions and finite distances between\n\n\nfinal wave packets and interaction regions In these cases, the phase–time, clock and in\n\nstanton approaches give the results which are coincident with the mean duration or the\n\n\nsquare root of the duration–distribution variance obtained within our formalism And, the\n\n\nasymptotic mean dwell time is the weighted average sum of the corresponding tunnelling and\n\n\nreflection durations Moreover, such “ asymptotic” coincidence can be naturally extended,\n\n\nif we take into account, also, the mean squared time duration\n\n\n< [τ N (x i, x f ) [2] ] >= [< τ N (x i, x f ) >] [2] + Dτ N (x i, x f ) (49)\n\n\nwith\n\n\nDτ N (x i, x f ) = Dt n (x f ) + Dt + (x i )\n\n\nwhere index N signifies T or tun or pen or R, and n = + or − Relation (49) can be\n\n\nrewritten also in the following equivalent forms:\n\n\n23\n\n\n< [τ N (x i, x f )] [2] >=< [t n (x f )− < t + (x i ) >] [2] - +Dt + (x i )\n\n\n=< [< t n (x f ) > −t + (x i )] [2]        - +Dt n (x i ) (50)\n\n\n\nAnd, now we see that [< τ T [ph] >] [2] + Dτ T [ph], the squared hybrid time [(τ y,tun [La] [)] [2] [ + (][τ] z,tun [ La] [)] [2] []] [1][/][2] [,]\n\n\nintroduced by B¨uttiker [61], and the squared absolute value of the complex tunnelling time,\n\n\nin the Feynman path–integration approach, are examples of mean squared durations and,\n\n\nall three are coincident in the cases of the infinite spatial extension of the magnetic field\n\n\nfor the B¨uttiker hybrid time and of the instanton version pf the Feynman formalism By\n\n\nthe way, this formalism has been earlier applied and tested in the time analysis of nuclear\n\n\nand atomic collisions for which the boundary conditions are experimentally and theoretically\n\n\nassigned in the region, asymptotically distant from the interaction region, where the incident\n\n\n(before collision) and final (after collision) fluxes are well separated in time, without any\n\n\nsuperposition and interference And, it has been supported (see in particular, [25,26] and\n\n\nreferences therein) by the results: (i) the validity of a correspondence principle between\n\n\nthe time–energy QM commutation relation and the CM Poisson brackets; (ii) the validity\n\n\nof an Ehrenfest principle for the average time durations; (iii) the coincidence of the quasi\n\n\nclassical limit of our own QM definitions for time durations (when such a limit exists; i e , for\n\n\nabove–barrier energies) with analogous well-known expressions of classical mechanics; (iv)\n\n\nthe analysis of all other known theoretical approaches to the definition of collision durations,\n\n\non the base of our formalism; (v) the analysis of experimental data on direct and indirect\n\n\nmeasurements of nuclear–reaction durations, at the range 10 [−][21] –10 [−][15] sec, and, in particular,\n\n\nthe extraction from these data of informations on compound–nucleus level densities with the\n\n\nappropriate juxtaposition of the obtained informations with data of other experiments Let us stress that for complete extracting the time–duration values from experimental\n\n\ndata on indirect measurements of nuclear–reaction durations, it is necessary to utilize not\n\n\nonly the expressions for mean durations but also correct definitions of the duration variances\n\n\nand the higher–order central moments of the duration distribution [26] which is provided\n\n\n24\n\n\nby our formalism At least, let us note that such a formalism also provided useful tools\n\n\nfor resolving some long– standing problems related to the time–energy uncertainty relation\n\n\n[25,26] II For the applications of the presented formalism to such cases, when one intends to\n\n\nconsider, not only asymptotic distances but also the region inside and near interactions,\n\n\nwe have revised the notation of averaging weight (or integration measure) in time represen\n\ntation, utilizing two measure J ± (x, t) for calculations of instant and duration mean values,\n\n\ndistribution variances, for particle moving, passing, transferring and the measure dP (x, t) or\n\n\nP (x 1, x 2 ; t) for limited calculations of only mean durations for particle staying, or dwelling And, with these three measures, we can arrange all known approaches (but, of course, within\n\n\nthe conventional quantum mechanics), including the mean dwell time, the Larmor–clock\n\n\ntimes and the times given by various versions of the Feynman path–integration approach,\n\n\ninto an unique consistent and non–contradictory scheme on the base of our formalism even\n\n\ninside and near barriers By the way, dP (x, t) can be used as the adequate averaging measure for defining mean\n\n\nvalues and variances of position and distance distributions (see also [14]), together with\n\n\nJ ± (x, t) as the measures for the definitions of the mean traversed distances during finite time\n\n\nintervals, for constructing the basic quantum–mechanical formalism of the space analysis of\n\n\ncollision and propagation processes III",
    "III The O–R flux separation scheme, within the conventional quantum mechanics (and\n\n\nquantum electrodynamics), is not the only possible one,although it is the only known in\n\ncoherent flux separation without introducing any new postulates Within the conventional\n\n\nquantum theory one can also get the physically clear (but mathematically not very suit\n\nable) coherent wave–packet separation by positive and negative momenta, which is explicit\n\n\nout of the barrier region and is obtainable by the momentum Fourier expansion inside the\n\n\nbarrier region This separation can be transformed in the incoherent flux separation, after\n\n\nutilizing the postulate of quantum measurement theory, about a possibility to describe mea\n\nsurement conditions by the corresponding projector, acting on wave functions, namely by\n\n\n25\n\n\nthe projectors Λ exp,± onto positive–momentum and negative–momentum states respectively There are also flux separation schemes within nonstandard versions of quantum theory (see\n\n\nexamples in Sec There are also flux separation schemes within nonstandard versions of quantum theory (see\n\n\nexamples in Sec 5) However, whatever separation scheme we choose, we have to keep to\n\n\nat least two necessary conditions: (1) the probabilistic meaning of every normalized flux\n\n\ncomponent and, (2) passing to the standard flux expressions in the asymptotically remote\n\n\nspatial region, well–known in quantum collision theory (since the boundary conditions of any\n\n\nquantum collision in the asymptotic range are for long inspected and have not to depend\n\n\nfrom a chosen version of quantum mechanics) For the space inside and near a barrier at least four kinds of separations of wave–packet\n\n\nfluxes do now coexist, with the fulfillment of these conditions for all of them These separa\n\ntions are defined by different schemes, although univocally from the mathematical point of\n\n\nview: (i) the O–R separation J = J + + J − with J ± = JΘ(±J) was obtained within the con\n\nventional probabilistic continuity equation (following from the time–dependent Schr¨odinger\n\n\nequation) without any new physical postulate or any new mathematical approximation [53] The asymptotic behaviour of the obtained expressions was tested by the comparison with\n\n\nother approaches and with the experimental results [35]; (ii) the proposed here separation\n\n\nJ = J exp,+ +J exp,− (J exp,± being the fluxes which correspond to Λ exp,± Ψ(x, t) respectively) ob\n\ntained also within the conventional probabilistic continuity equation, however after applying\n\n\nthe projector ( or wave–function reduction) postulate of quantum measurement theory The\n\n\nasymptotic behaviour of the expressions, obtained on the base of this separation, is the same\n\n\nas in (i); (iii) relation (28) was obtained in the Muga–Brouard–Sala approach, according to\n\n\nthe physical clear incoherent flux separation by positive and negative momenta, but with\n\n\nadditional introducing the model of the Wigner–path distribution; (iv) relation (34) was ob\n\ntained in the Leavens approach, according to the incoherent flux separation by trajectories\n\n\nof particles to be transmitted and to be reflected, with introducing the nonstandard Bohm\n\n\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics The flux separation schemes (i), (iii), and (iv) give asymmetric expressions for the mean\n\n\ndwell time near a barrier (see the relations (21), (29), and (30)–(33) respectively), apparently\n\n\n26\n\n\ndue to the right–left asymmetry of boundary conditions: we have a partially simultaneous\n\n\ncoexistence of incident and reflected wave packets from the left and the only one transmitted\n\n\nwave packet on the right The separation (ii) gives the symmetric expression (22) for the\n\n\nmean dwell time even near a barrier IV From reasonings, presented in Sec 2, 6, and 8, one can easily see that positive values\n\n\n(or values inside (or on) the light cone for relativistic waves) of the collision or propagation\n\n\nor tunnelling duration is only a sufficient but not the necessary causality condition Now, we\n\n\nhave not a unique general formulation of the causality principle which would be necessary\n\n\nfor all possible cases",
    "Now, we\n\n\nhave not a unique general formulation of the causality principle which would be necessary\n\n\nfor all possible cases In Sec 2 and Sec 2 and Sec 8 some new formulations of the causality condition\n\n\nare proposed for possible approbations V The phenomenon of reshaping (reconstructing), which was spoken about in Sec 8, as\n\n\nwell as the advance phenomenon at the beginning of tunnelling, which was spoken about in\n\n\nSe 6, are closely connected with a coherent super–position of incoming and reflected waves It is advisable to examine these phenomena from various viewpoints and within various\n\n\napproaches with the scope to elucidate causality condition during tunnelling Moreover, the\n\n\ninvestigation of the phenomena of reshaping (reconstructing) and advance by themselves\n\n\ncould pursue, moreover, two important purposes: it will inevitably be the necessary part of\n\n\nthe future kinematic theory of the tunnelling of particles, waves, many–particle systems, and\n\n\nsolitons inside and near potential barriers and besides, that can serve as a base of the birth\n\n\nand development of a new field of the physical information–a superluminal propagation of\n\n\ninformation (see also [91]) VI It is known that there are multiple internal reflections from the both potential walls\n\n\nand corresponding multiple penetrations through the walls during the particle motion inside\n\n\na potential well or a potential barrier with above–barrier energies [95,96] The sums of the\n\n\nmultiply reflected and penetrated waves give the resulted reflected and transmitted waves\n\n\nwith the final reflection and transmission amplitudes Naturally, the following question\n\n\narises: are there such multiple internal reflections and corresponding penetrations during\n\n\nparticle tunnelling with sub–barrier energies In [96] this question was studied and replied\n\n\n27\n\n\nformally positively But a simple analysis permits to clear up that the matching conditions\n\n\ngive definite solutions only when inside a barrier the motion along the incident flux is\n\n\ndescribed by the decreasing wave and the motion against the incident flux is described by the\n\n\nincreasing wave However, for such waves, the fluxes are always equal to zero For resolving\n\n\nthis paradox, one can try to analyze the momentum Fourier–expansions of decreasing and\n\n\nincreasing waves But then intricate paradoxes with a-causality appear This problem is\n\n\nvery curious and can born some surprises VII",
    "VII As one can conclude, the O–R formalism, presented here, permits in principle to\n\n\nstudy temporal characteristics in the Schr¨odinger and Feynman representations (which are\n\n\nformally equivalent) By the way, an interesting attempt was undertaken in [97] to develop\n\n\nthe self–consistent method for calculating time quantities related to the motion of a particle,\n\n\nutilizing the Feynman representation and comparing the proposed method with the O–R\n\n\nformalism (in its earlier version presented in [35], however without the separation J =\n\n\nJ + + J − ) VIII VIII There is one more possible formally equivalent to the Schr¨odinger and Feynman\n\n\nrepresentation for examining the collision and tunnelling evolution As it is known, in\n\n\nthe quantum theory to energy E, two operators correspond– the operator ih∂/∂t¯ and the\n\n\nhamiltonian operator H in terms of the coordinate and momentum operators The duality\n\n\nof these operators is well seen from the Schr¨odinger equation HΨ = ih∂¯ Ψ/∂t The similar\n\n\n¯\nduality takes place for time in quantum mechanics: besides the general form −ih∂/∂E,\n\n\nwhich is valid for any physical system (in the continuum energy spectrum), it is possible to\n\n\nexpress the time operator T, utilizing the commutation relation [T, H] = ih¯, in terms of\n\n\nthe coordinate and momentum operators too [21,26] And, to study the collision and the\n\n\ntunnelling evolution, via the operator T with the corresponding equation T Ψ = tΨ, it can\n\n\nprove to be useful too, particularly for researching, the influence of the barrier form on the\n\n\ntunnelling time [26] IX",
    "IX Time analysis of more complex processes, such as formations and decays of metastable\n\n\nstates and time correlations of fluctuations of various quantities in many–particle systems\n\n\n28\n\n\nwith the accompaniment of tunnelling processes, has to be developed on the base of the\n\n\nadequate formalisms for such processes, which are not developed yet and were only marked\n\n\nin [26] for simple approximations X X Time analysis in processes in the discrete energy spectra (for instance, for evolving\n\n\nwave packets composed from bound states inside two–well potentials with a barrier between\n\n\nwells) is quite different from time analysis of processes in the continuous energy spectra For\n\n\nsuch processes, one can use the formalism based on the properties of the time operator in the\n\n\ndiscrete energy spectra [26,76], and, durations of transitions, (with non–zero fluxes), from\n\n\none well to another, are defined by the Poincare‘ period 2πh/d¯ min, where d min is the maximal\n\n\ncommon divisor of the level distances The latter is defined, mainly, by the minimal level\n\n\nsplitting caused by the barrier and hence depends on the barrier transition (penetration)\n\n\nprobability at the appropriate energies The latter is defined, mainly, by the minimal level\n\n\nsplitting caused by the barrier and hence depends on the barrier transition (penetration)\n\n\nprobability at the appropriate energies 29\n\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n\n[1] E U Condon, Rev Mod Phys Phys 3, 43 (1931) [2] L A MacColl, Phys Rev Rev 40, 621 (1932) [3] D Bohm, Quantum Theory (Prentice–Hall, New York, 1952) [4] E Wigner, Phys Rev 98, 145 (1955) [5] F Smith, Phys Rev 118, 349 (1960); 119, 2098 (1960) [6] M L Goldberger and K M Watson, Phys Rev 127, 2284 (1962); M Froissart, M L Goldberger, and K M Watson, ibid 131, 2820 (1963); M L Goldberger and K M Watson, Collision Theory (Wiley, New York, 1964) [7] T Ohmura, Prog Theor Phys Suppl 12, 108 (1964) [8] R Fong, Phys Rev B 140, 762 (1965) [9] A I Baz’, Sov J Nucl Phys",
